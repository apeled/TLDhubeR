    "episode_summary": "n this episode, I discuss working memory, which is critical for learning and productivity, strategy setting, goal seeking, and navigating new environments. I explain the key role of dopamine and the biological mechanisms underlying working memory and how working memory differs from both short- and long-term memory. I also describe science-supported tools to enhance working memory and attentionâ€”including zero- or low-cost behavioral, supplemental and pharmacologic approaches. I include how to assess your working memory and how to use memory tasks to determine your baseline dopamine levels in certain brain circuits. This episode provides listeners with highly actionable tools to assess and improve their attention to specific tasks and task-switching capacity and to enhance their overall productivity.",
