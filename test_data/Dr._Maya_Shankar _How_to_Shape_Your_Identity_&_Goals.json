            "text": "Andrew Huberman: [INTRO THEME MUSIC]\nWelcome to the Huberman Lab podcast,where w e discuss science and\nscience-based tools for everyday life.I'm Andrew Huberman, and I'm a professor\nof Neurobiology and Ophthalmologyat Stanford School of Medicine.Today, my guest is Dr.Maya Shankar.Dr.Maya Shankar is a cognitive scientist\nwho did her undergraduate trainingat Yale University, her PhD thesis as\na Rhodes Scholar, and a postdoctoralfellowship also in Cognitive\nScience at Stanford University.Dr.Shankar also served as a senior\nadvisor to the White House, and shefounded and served as the Chair of the\nWhite House Behavioral Science team.Dr.Shankar is also the host of her\nown podcast entitled A SlightChange of Plans . And indeed, Dr.Shankar herself is no stranger to\nhaving to make major changes to one'slife plans, as you'll learn today.Prior to all of those incredible\naccomplishments that Dr.Shankar has achieved, she was a\nstudent at the Juilliard Conservatoryof Music, preparing her life to\nbecome a professional concertviolinist, but as you'll also soon\nlearn, she then experienced a careerdevastating injury, forcing herself\nto have to reframe everything abouther life plans and her own identity.And that's really what\nwe talk about today.We talk about identity.Not just Dr.Shankar's prior and current identities,\nbut, of course, your identity.We pose a number of questions\ngeared toward getting youto ask, who am I really?Do my goals align with\nwho I am and what I want?Dr.Shankar shares with us the research\non identity, goals, motivation, andplans, as well as many practical\ntools to answer those key questionsthat guide us down either the correct\nor incorrect trajectories in life.She shares with us, for instance,\nhow to assess on paper goals of thesort that you would see on a CV.So, which school, which job, which\nsalary, which spouse, etc., etc.,and how to relate those to the deeper\nfeelings that relate to one's abilityto continually pursue a given goal,\nknowing that it's the right goal for us.We also talk about the science of\nfeelings, what they can and cannottell us and when they should or should\nnot serve as a compass for guiding oureveryday and longer term decisions.By the end of today's episode,\nyou will realize that Dr.Shankar is essentially handing you a\nscience supported roadmap for how todetermine and assess your identity and\ngoals and how one influences the other.That is, how your identity influences\nyour goals and how your goalsinfluence your identity in becoming\nthe person that you want to be.Before we begin, I'd like to emphasize\nthat this podcast is separate from my"

            "text": "I'm so happy you're here.Maya Shankar: Thanks, Andrew.It's great to be here.Andrew Huberman: I have a lot of\nquestions about identity, aboutgoals and motivation, and about\nchange in general, but I'd like tostart off with identity, and I'd\nlike to divide it into two segments.The first is how we form an identity,\nand we'll get into your story in,I hope, a bit or more of detail,\nbut when we're younger, we tend toask questions about ourselves, but\nalso about the world around us.We want to learn what our parents\ndo for a living, what the workers onthe street are doing that for, etc.How much of our early identity do\nyou think is formed by observation ofwhat we are doing versus observation\nand labels of the people thatare around us and closest to us?Maya Shankar: Yeah, it's a great question.I think a lot of it is based on what\nwe see around us, and what we see isdeemed successful and society privileges.And there's a concept called identity\nforeclosure, where actually, whenyou're young, it's not just that you're\nobserving what your parents are doingor what your peer group is doing, they\nimpose their own structures on you.And so what that can do is it can really\nlimit your mindset in terms of what itis that you want to achieve and what\nit is that you're capable of achieving.And so oftentimes when people experience\nidentity foreclosure, they have totake a lot of active steps to overcome\nwhatever biases or limitations theyexperienced as a young person, given what\nthey were projected to do or believe.So, identity, it can be about what you do.It can also be about what you believe\nin the world, and so a lot of thosebelief systems are also passed down.You inherit belief systems from the\npeople that surround you when you'reyoung, and if there's one thing that\nI've learned, it's that we tend to puta huge premium on what it is that we do.We tend to define ourselves by what we do.And you can see this in the\nquestions we ask young children.What do you want to be when you grow up?We never say, who do you\nwant to be when you grow up?What kind of person do you\nwant to be when you grow up?We say, what do you want to be?And the consequence of that kind\nof mindset is that we end upanchoring our identities very\nfirmly to what it is that we do.You were alluding to my\npersonal story, right?I started playing the violin when\nI was a little kid, six years old,became absolutely obsessed, and for\nthe large part of my childhood, Iwas first and foremost a violinist.I mean, if I had met you, I'd be\nlike, hey, Andrew, I'm a violinist.And then the second up would be, I'm Maya.That's how tethered my identity\nwas to being a violinist.And then fast forward\nto when I'm a teenager.I have these huge dreams of\ngoing pro and becoming just,like, hopefully, a professional\nviolinist for the rest of my life.And then I tear a tendon in my hand.My dreams end overnight, and suddenly\nthere's this profound loss of identity,because what I hadn't realized is that\nin losing the violin, sure, I was losingthe ability to play the instrument, but\nI was actually losing a huge part ofwho I was, and that was so destabilizing\nand so disorienting for me, because whenyou define yourself by the what, then\nas soon as the what goes away, you'relike, oh, my gosh, who the hell am I?Andrew Huberman: What do I do?What value do I bring to the world?And what I experienced at the\ntime is known in cognitivescience as identity paralysis.Maybe you felt this way during various\ntransitions in your life, but basically,who you are and what you're about\nis suddenly called into question,and you end up feeling really stuck.You don't have the courage to imagine\nwhat a future could look like, and Icertainly fell prey to identity paralysis.And it took me a long time to kind of\nfigure out what my path would look likemoving forward, but I learned a really\nvaluable lesson from that very formativeexperience I had with change about\nhow it is that I should define myself.And for what it's worth, I don't\nthink our desire as humans tohave identities is going anywhere.We're not going to be able to dispose\nof identities, and we shouldn't, becauseour self-identities bring us so much\nmeaning and purpose in our lives.Maya Shankar: You're a podcaster.I'm a podcaster.You're a scientist.I'm a scientist.These things are actually\nreally helpful and motivating.So we don't want to do away with\nidentities altogether, but whatwe can be more particular about is\nwhat we anchor our identities to.And I have learned in my adult life\nto anchor my identity to why I do thethings I do rather than what I do.And I found this to be a much more\ndurable, reliable relationship.So to make this concrete,\nlet's think about the violin.Sure, I loved playing.I loved how music sounded.I loved the way the violin felt.But when I stripped away all the\nsuperficial features of the violin,what I really, really loved and\nwas so drawn to as a young childwas the emotional connection that\nI could form through my music.So that might have been with\nmy orchestra mates, my chambermusician friends, playing solo and\nperforming in front of an audience.And ideally, we all feel something\nnew that we haven't felt before.It's kind of an intoxicating feeling when\nyou're little, to have the ability toinspire new feelings in people, right?And I was so drawn to human connection,\nand when I realized that humanconnection was at the heart of what\nit is that drives me as a person.Like, what lights me up every single\nday is a desire to connect withothers, to understand other people,\nto understand their psychology, tounderstand how their minds work.Then when the violin was taken away from\nme, even in terms of the narrative Itell myself about my life, I could still\nfind that same core underlying featureelsewhere, and I have been able to.I found it as an academic, as a\ncognitive scientist who studies thescience of connection and emotion.I've seen that connection play out\nin the work that I did in publicpolicy when I was at the White House.Obviously, with my podcast, A\nSlight Change of Plans . You'reforming these intimate\nconnections with people every day.And so even though it feels in my life\nlike I've done such disparate things,there actually is a powerful through\nline that connects all of them, and thatis my desire to connect emotionally.And so what I would recommend to\npeople who are listening, especiallyif they're in the throes of change,\nand they're feeling destabilizedby that threat to identity.That loss of identity is to try to\nfigure out what their through line is.What are the underlying features\nof the things that you used todo that you absolutely loved?And can you find the\nexpression of that elsewhere?Andrew Huberman: I love that,\nand I have so many questions.The first one relates back to\nchildhood identities and how we"

            "text": "often can project onto children\nwhat they are likely to become.I see that as mostly benevolent.You observe a child playing with\ntrucks in the sandbox, and we say, oh,they're going to become a contractor.We tend to project roles that are fairly\nhigh up within the occupation hierarchy.Like any parents, you wish for the\nbest possible life for your kids.But I can see the perils of doing\nthat if then the kid starts tothink, well, that's what I'm bound\nto become, because it is restrictive.I also am fascinated by the fact that\nwhen we are adolescents and teens,there's a tendency to ask questions\nabout identity, like, who am I?I don't know many 40 year\nolds that say, who am I?At one's core, one's essence, and we might\nchange careers, change relationships,change geographies, all sorts of things.But there must be something going\non in the brain in those adolescentand teen years that forces this\nquestion of self, of who am I?And teenagers are notorious for trying\non different uniforms, differentfriend groups, different behaviors, as\na way to sort that out, sometimes inways that support them and sometimes\nin ways that act as pitfalls.So I'm curious about what's known about\nhow we develop our own identity from theinside out as well as from the outside in.Maya Shankar: Yeah, no, that's\nreally interesting, and it's alsosomething I'm very curious about.I mean, we know from neuroscience\nresearch that there are significantchanges that the brain undergoes\nduring puberty and other periods ofadolescence, and the primary change that\nwe see is a desire for independence.And so one reason why we see teenagers\ngrappling with this question of who I amis that they're actually breaking from\nthese structures that they grew up around.The imposed structures, t he identity\nforeclosure that they might haveexperienced and are starting to\nfigure out for the first time, orwanting to ask the question for the\nfirst time, who do I want to be?What do I want to do outside of\nthe systems that I've grown up in?And I think this is one of the\nprimary reasons why we find thatduring teenage years, this sort of\nquestion is asked more commonly.I think that one challenge that we\ncan face, because you said this oneword that really caught my attention,\nwhich was, what's my essence?And one of the things I studied as a\ncognitive scientist, is the psychologyof what's called essentialism.So our underlying belief is that there\nare essential qualities to peoplethat are immutable, and there's lots\nof studies with young children andadults showing that we really believe\nthat people do have these essences.And it's unclear what that even\nmeans in a metaphysical sense, Idon't know what that would even mean.I think that the challenge in believing\nthat we have essences is that itleads us to believe that there are\nthese truly immutable states aboutourselves that we're incapable of\nchanging, and I think this can giverise to feelings of shame, for example.So what is shame?Shame is not the feeling,\noh, I did something bad.Shame is the feeling, I am bad.It's not that I lost at something,\nI failed at something, it'sthat I'm a loser, I'm a failure.And so the problem when we try to figure\nout the essence piece is that it doesn'tgive you the kind of malleable way of\nthinking that actually there might notbe something that's so defining about\nyou that you're incapable of changing.As humans, maybe all we are are\ncollections of behaviors and thoughts.And there's nothing more to it than that.And I find that way of thinking a bit\nmore freeing when it comes to who weare, because I think it allows us to\ncultivate more of a growth mindset.I think it prevents us from\nengaging in these very harmfulself-narratives that a lot of people\ntend to have about themselves.Probably a lot of people listening\nto your podcast are self-critical.I'm a very self-critical person.We listen to this because\nwe want to improve.I'm a fan of your show because I want\nto be better and I want to improve.But that also is often accompanied\nby a lot of self-beratingand questioning of self.And so, yeah, I think I've just\ntried to have a slightly morecapacious understanding of who I\nam and also recognizing that theremight not really be these essential\nfeatures that are immutable.I don't know if you resonate\nwith this notion of the desireto feel that we have essences?Andrew Huberman: Yeah, I used the word\nessence without thinking too carefullyabout exactly what I meant, but what I\nwas trying to say when I said essenceis as a child, I did certain things,\nand I enjoyed some of them, didn't enjoy"

            "text": "others, and I really disliked others.A very famous neuroscientist who's at\nCaltech named Marcus Meister, peopleliterally refer to him as the great\nMarcus Meister, once said, and Itotally subscribe to the fact, that\nneural circuits in the brain basicallydivide our sensory experience along\nthe dimensions of yum yuck and meh.There's not a lot of in between, because\nthe circuits ultimately have to driveeither forward movement toward more\nrepetitive behaviors, as in nerdspeak, oraversive leaning out, I don't want that.Or just kind of a neutral\nresponse, a yum yuck and mehseems to be the trinary response.And there is this component of childhood,\nI think, where we are foraging naturally,using our senses, experiencing yum,\nyucks, and mehs and hearing yum,yucks and mehs from our parents.That's good, that's bad, that's whatever.It's neutral.But at some point, I certainly have had\nthe experience and I've observed others,I think having the experience of feeling\nsomething that's on a different dimensionentirely, which is this notion of delight,\nwhich is that it sort of fills your bodywith a sense of so much yum that it gives\nyou energy to do so much more of it in away that is almost on a different plane.And I'm not trying to be spiritual\nor metaphysical about it, butit feels distinctly different.And I don't know what it represents, but\nI think that's that piece that perhaps,even as a scientist, I don't really\nneed to assign a neural circuit to.Maya Shankar: Sure, d o you\nthink what you're describingin part is the feeling of awe?Like, when you talk about delight, do\nyou think part of it is a feeling of awe?Andrew Huberman: Yeah.Like the first time I went to New York\nCity as a six year old kid, I rememberthinking, and I still feel every time I'm\nthere, I can't believe this place exists.It's like a human tropical reef.Like everywhere you look, there's life.So that was awe and delight.Although I saw some things, this was\nNew York in the 70s, there were somethings like Times Square in the 70s.If anyone's seen that show, The Deuces\n, it looked like that, especially as ayoung kid, it was kind of aversive.Maya Shankar: Yeah.Andrew Huberman: So it wasn't always\nawed, but the delight for me was inlearning, and certain animals and\ncertain things for you as the violin.And I want to make sure that I--Maya Shankar: --And awe, by the\nway, I mean, it can be aversive.So awe isn't necessarily, I think,\nin the western world, we think ofawe-inspiring experiences as having a\npositive emotional valence, but they canalso have a negative emotional valence.So, the two criteria for satisfying\nan awe-inspiring experience, and alot of this work comes from Dacher\nKeltner, professor at Berkeley,is one, there should be some\nelement of perceived vastness.This is all reference dependent.So it's all based on your own frame of\nmind, but there's this sense of mysteryand wonder at just how vast either the\nphysical apparatus is, like Times Square.It's this massive set of buildings,\nand it kind of overwhelms yoursenses because of all the lights and\nsounds that are hitting your visualsystem and your auditory system.There's also conceptual vastness.So we can feel awe when we\nfeel the delight of a newscientific discovery, right?Or in my case, like for the first time\nreading a book about how the mind works.I just remember marveling\nat this organ and just beingcompletely in awe of how it works.And then the second criteria for an\nawe-inspiring experience, which Ithink might have been met as well\nwhen you were in New York, is what'scalled a need for accommodation.So it's just a fancy way of saying that we\nhave a certain mental model of the world.And typically in the presence of\nawe, we need to assimilate this newinformation with our existing model\nbecause it challenges it in some way.And it actually leads us to have\nmore open minds because we realize,wait a second, I have this existing\nvision of what the world is like andnow I'm experiencing this new thing\nand I need to kind of make it work.I need to integrate it with my\nexisting understanding of the worldand that's the mind blowing part of it.But I absolutely remember my childhood\nexperience kind of mirroring yourexperience in New York, I was twelve\nyears old or maybe eleven years old.I was at a summer music camp.It was late at night.I had my Discman, which is how we\nlistened to things back in the day.I recall I had a CD in there.It was the Beethoven Violin\nConcerto by Anne Sophie Mutter.I was so young, Andrew, so I still\ndon't know how to use words to describehow it is that I felt something that\nwas so powerful and so transcendent.But I remember listening to the\nfirst movement of this violinconcerto and it consumed me.I mean, I felt chills\nup and down my spine.My heart would race along with the melody.It felt otherworldly, right?And I think that was kind of what\nyou're getting at before where it'slike it's this altered state of mind.And the language I've used since\nto code that experience is thatit was an awe-inspiring experience\nbecause I think both things happened.I was impressed by the\nvastness of the experience.It also sent me through time\nin this interesting way, backto the time of Beethoven.So the vastness can exist along a\ntemporal horizon and then the need foraccommodation, which, you know, I didn't\nstudy cognitive science at this point.So I remember thinking I cannot believe a\ncollection of musical notes arranged justso can make me feel this way and that if\nyou were to tweak it just slightly, justlike, take the E flat and move it down the\nstream a little bit, emotional resonanceis completely gone from the passage.And there was just something so simple\nand magical about that realization.So, anyway, I resonate with\nthis kind of delight and aweexperience that you describe.Andrew Huberman: Yeah, I'm\nso glad you described it."

            "text": "That, you know, this isn't a discussion\nabout my experience, but for me, I realizenow that New York was awe-inspiring.Prior to that, the only thing similar\nwas discovering animal specialization,something I'm still fascinated by,\nthe sensory systems of animals andhow they experience the world and\nhow humans experience the world.And then ultimately, it was, well,\nthen I went into skateboardingand that whole landscape, and\nthen eventually into neuroscience.The difference between the New York\nexperience of awe, and I do think thatthat's what it was, and biology, animals,\nand eventually neuroscience, is that,like your experience with music and\nrealizing that the movement of a notecould change something fundamentally\nwhen it came to learning about biologyand neuroscience, I felt not just\nawe, but a sense of delight in that.I felt there was a place for me there.And what came out of what you just\ndescribed really resonated in terms ofthis moving of a note, because it took\nsomething from a passive experience, Ibelieve, of that's this incredible thing\nover there, like New York City, was awe.But I didn't see myself having any\nkind of verb state within it that wouldchange it or alter how it is, or for me.Whereas with music, for you or, I think\nneuroscience, when I realized that youcould do experiments, you could actually\ndo some sort of manipulation, andthrough that, hopefully unveil something\nfundamental about how the brain works,I thought, there's a place for me here.And so I think there's something\nabout the experience of somethingjust from a raw sensory perspective,\nmusic or animals or neurosciencein the examples we're using here.But then realizing that there's\na verb state of self like that,I could enact something within it\nthat could give me more of that.Whereas I think when, as a young kid\nin New York City, I just didn't feelany way that I could plug into it\nexcept in a passive way, because it'sthe difference between a kid who, and\nthis wouldn't have been me who sees agame of soccer or football or baseball\nor watches the Olympics and goes, thatis amazing, and the kid that says, I'm\ngoing to go do that, in fact, I coulddo that, and I could maybe do that\neven better, or even half as well.And so the delight, I think,\nis in the possibility ofengagement, and I'm fascinated.A friend of mine who's a trauma\ntherapist, he's not a neuroscientist.He always says nouns are just\nvery slow verbs, but verbs arefar more exciting because they\ncreate this anticipatory activity.Anyway--Maya Shankar: --Before you move on\nfrom that, I love that you said that,because you're helping me realize\nsomething really important abouthow I saw my role as a violinist.I'm never going to modify the notes on\nthe page, because obviously, I'm goingto be faithful to what Beethoven wrote.Andrew Huberman: This is what\nmade you a great musician.And me, by the way, I\nwas a failed violinist.They pulled me out of it because\nt he neighbor's dogs howled.I was in the Suzuki method.I was so terrible at it that they\nliterally made me stop playing musicjust to protect the neighborhood.Maya Shankar: That's adorable.And we'll talk about\nthe science of quitting.Maybe later, but that was\na great choice for you.But what I'm realizing is that there\nwas that element of defining selfthrough the pursuit of the instrument.And I saw a place for myself exactly\nlike you did, where I thought, Idecide how this phrase unfolds.I decide how much vibrato I use.I decide exactly what the angling\nof my bow is and the cadenceand the pacing and the emotion\nthat I bring to the experience.And when you see a place for yourself,\nthat takes an awe-inspiring experience.And then, actually, there's a translation\nprocess where you become something biggerthan what you thought you could be.And actually, it's so interesting you\nmentioned this, Andrew, because I'vebeen chatting recently with a guy named\nReginald Dwayne Betts, and he spentnine years in prison, and he's now\nan internationally renowned scholar.So he committed a carjacking when\nhe was 15 years old and then wentto an adult prison for nine years.Andrew Huberman: As a 15 year old?Maya Shankar: He just turned 16\nby the time he got his sentence.Yeah, it was totally wild.Andrew Huberman: Brutal.Maya Shankar: And he actually talks\nabout the fact that there was thisunderground library in the prison system,\nand he didn't know what he could be inthe prison, what identity he could take\non when everyone seemed to be definedby what crime they had committed.It felt like his imagination\nwas so limited to the talkabout identity paralysis.I mean, you're denied all your basic\nfreedoms in this environment, right?So you really don't even have the ability\nto imagine what more you could be.So one day he gets a book called The\nBlack Poets . And in the book, heread a poem by Etheridge Knight, who\nhad also spent time in prison and hadwritten this incredibly stirring poem\nabout the criminal justice system.And he goes by Dwayne, but what Dwayne\nshared with me is he said, I wasawe inspired by what I was reading.But the most important thing that\nhappened in reading that book andunderstanding the author's history\nis that it gave me something to be.I saw a place for myself in this world.And he was so prolific.He wrote like a thousand poems\nin the year after he stumbledupon this book, and he ended up\nwinning the MacArthur Genius Award.He went to Yale Law School.I mean, he's just crushed it ever since.But I think you've stumbled upon\na really important point, which isthere's a fascinating science of awe\nand all the benefits it can conferto our well being, but it can also\nserve as an entry point to helping todefine our identities in new places.And I just love that.I think that's a wonderful\nway to think about it.Andrew Huberman: Yeah.When we see ourselves entering\nthe sphere of experience that isevoking awe, I do think something\nabout it converts to this delight.Although I have to acknowledge that\nlanguage is insufficient to describea lot of what we're referring to.Right.Even the most reductionist language\nof biology can't grab the higherorder emotions and complexity.Not yet, anyway.We just don't have a language for it.I'd like to talk more about the violin,\nnot just because I failed miserably at the"

actually very excited.She was 21 years old, by the way.So, long story short, she had met my dad\n20 days prior to their getting married.So it was an arranged meeting.And my dad is doing his postdoc at Harvard\nin physics at the Society of Fellows.And my mom just joins him after\na winter break in the dorm.And everyone's like, hey,\nman, how was your break?And there's like, I went snowboarding\nand I went, whatever, to Tahoe.And my dad's like, I got married.And so this new couple arrives, and\nmy mom was so lonely in this country.I mean, this was before you\ncould text your parents overseasor use a WhatsApp group.So she could only handwrite\nletters to her family back home.And her goal was, you know what?I'm going to create a little army\naround me in the form of children.So she had four kids, and she\nwas absolutely intent on exposingus to as many extracurricular\nactivities as she could.So I have two older brothers and I have\nan older sister, especially her girls.She said, you can do whatever you want.I'm going to give you lay the land\nwhen you're young, but when you findsomething that you're passionate\nabout, I really want to give youthe opportunity to explore it.So I think I really benefited from the\nfact that she had been denied that kindof exposure and the ability to pursue\nher dreams, artistic or otherwise.And so she was really hell bent on\nmaking sure that we kids were able to.My older three siblings played\nmusical instruments, so, likeclarinet, trumpet, flute.I think they were surprised by\nmy affinity for it because whenI was six, my mom brought down my\ngrandmother's violin from the attic.So my grandmother had played\nIndian classical music.So that's where you're sitting\ncross legged on the floor andyour violins facing the ground.It's a very different style of music.But as, like, a parting gift, my\ngrandmother had given it to my mom andsaid, hey, bring this with you to the US.So she opened the instrument that day,\nand I just instantly fell in love with it.And I asked very quickly for a\nquarter-size violin of my own.And while my parents had to nudge me\nto do all sorts of things, they reallynever had to push me to practice,\nwhich felt extraordinary at the time.Like, okay, clearly the violin is\nsomething that Maya has intrinsicmotivation for, because how is\nit that we're not asking her tohave to practice all the time?Similar to you, Andrew, I\nnever to this day, I have areally hard time reading music.I never, I was a terrible sight reader.I couldn't, if you put a piece of music in\nfront of me, I would not be able to tellyou probably what it would sound like.Today, I learn entirely by ear.So I started with the Suzuki method,\nwhich, as you know, is entirely by ear.And then I had an extremely kind,\nawesome, but very inexperienced teacher.I was his first student.My mom went backstage at a symphony\nconcert in New Haven, which is where Igrew up, and just asked the concertmaster,\nlike, hey, will you teach my daughter?And he's like, sure.Never taught anyone before,\nbut I'll give this a go.And so we just made\nthings up along the way.I mean, he would play stuff and I would\nmimic it, and I would let my emotionsand whatever innate musicality guide me.And eventually, I think what that did\nactually is really interesting, from askill building perspective my technique\nabsolutely suffered in the long term fromnot having a more structured approach,\nbut I was able to fall in love withthis endeavor much more quickly than\nother kids who had drill sergeants thatwere forcing them to practice their\nscales every day and practice etudes.I mean, that stuff is so boring, right?And when you're a little kid, you\njust want to bang your head againstthe wall when you're put up against\nthat, when there's so many barriersto actually enjoying the fun parts,\nwhich are actually playing the pieces.So the one kind of fun aside about\nmy musical journey is I got to jumpstraight to the fun stuff, and I\nthink that helped me cultivate a muchmore natural love of the instrument.Andrew Huberman: As many of you\nknow, I've been taking AG1 daily"

            "text": "I've talked a few times before\non the podcast about this.I think of a now famous study that\nwas done at Bing Nursery School atStanford, where they observed what kids\ndid during free time, and then theyrewarded them or didn't reward them,\nand then they later removed the rewards.And the essential takeaway is that\nreceiving rewards for something thata child was initially intrinsically\nmotivated to do undermines someof that intrinsic motivation.So I have to wonder whether or not the\nfact that your parents neither encouragednor discouraged your violin playing\nmight have allowed you to fully expressand lean into your intrinsic motivation,\nas opposed to, for instance in my case,we are distantly related, not closely\nrelated, but there is a great violinistby the name of Bronislav Huberman, who\nhas a street named after him in Israel.There's a famous picture of him and\nEinstein playing violin together.And I was told about that early on.And when I failed to play well\nafter a couple of practices, I wasconvinced that there was no way I was\ngoing to live up to it, and I quit.Maya Shankar: That's a high bar.Andrew Huberman: It's a high bar.Maya Shankar: I didn't have\nany such role models that I wastrying to be like in my family.[LAUGHS]Andrew Huberman: Yeah, it\nturns out, but, exactly!And so I think that there's actually more\nopportunity in kids leaning into, andadults probably leaning into the sensory\nexperience of what they're doing and notputting that up against some benchmark.I worry about that today so much with\nsocial media and with video games,where in a video game we're on social\nmedia, you can see something beingdone at the very highest level, often\nby someone quite young or early intheir career, to the point where it\ncan be a little bit overwhelming.And I think then we start measuring\nourselves against metrics thatare not about the experience.That said, your parents, whatever\nthey did worked out well enough thatyou became very proficient, right?You succeeded in getting into\nJuilliard, which, at least from myunderstanding, is the most competitive\nmusic preparatory, is that how you referto it, that one can possibly go to?And so at that point, had your identity\nmerged with the behavior, and wereyou still enjoying yourself up until\nthe point where you had this injury?That we'll also talk about.Maya Shankar: Yeah, I was still enjoying\nmyself around the time when I auditionedfor Juilliard, in particular, because\nof exactly what you said, which wasthat everything was kind of beating\nmy expectations and my parents'expectations up until this point.Which is that we didn't really\nhave any, and so it all justfelt like icing on the cake.Wow!Our kids found something\nthat they really love.This is great, right?It can sometimes take you years,\ndecades, to figure out what it is thatyou love, what you're passionate about.And I think we go through this\nrenewal process often in our lives.I've had to have moments in life\nwhere I'm like, what do I like again?What do I love again?And so it's not also a one time\nexperience, but there was a thrillingaspect to my musical life when I was\nyoung, which was, again, everythingkind of felt like, it's like, a bonus.So one story I love sharing\nis about how I even got intoJuilliard in the first place.So my dad's a theoretical\nphysicist, as you mentioned.My mom helps immigrants get green\ncards to study in this country.Neither of them had exposure\nto the classical music sphere.So they're, like, the\nopposite of tiger parents.Like, even if they wanted to be tiger\nparents, they wouldn't know how tobe tiger parents in this domain,\nbecause they lack the connectionsand the wherewithal to figure out\nwhat it would mean to go pro and toaccess the best teachers or whatever.So my mom, who is a very fearless\nperson by nature, she knew thatat some point, my passion for the\nviolin was surpassing her ability toconnect me with the right resources.And so one weekend, we were in New\nYork, awe-inspiring New York, and Ihad my violin with me because I had\nanother audition, and we were justwalking by Juilliard, the building.And my mom was just eager for me to\nsee it from the outside because it'sjust really cool as a kid, right?It's like, all your musical\nidols went to this place.I just wanted to see it and imagine what\nit would have been like for Perlman togo in and out and Midori to go in and\nout, Yo Yo Ma, li ke, it's so exciting.And as we're passing the entrance,\nmy mom looks at me and says,hey, why don't we just go in?And I was like, what\nare you talking about?She's like, let's just go in.What's the worst thing that can happen?And I'm like, security guards and a lot\nof other terrible things, mom, right?But I had a useful enthusiasm that\npropelled me into the building that day.She strikes up a conversation with\na fellow student, and her mom findsout that she's studying with a top\nteacher at Juilliard, asks if we canget an introduction within an hour.I'm auditioning for this\nteacher on the spot.Right.No idea that this was going to happen.Andrew Huberman: Wild!Maya Shankar: Yeah, he tells me\nhe has what I refer to as a mutedenthusiasm about my playing.Doesn't think I'm great, but, sees\nsomething, he told me later heliked my personality, my enthusiasm.So I got the personality card\ncoming out of that music audition.Great.And what he did is he\nsaid, look, I'm with you.I don't think that you're ready.You would not get into Juilliard\nif you auditioned today.However, I take residence at a\nsummer music program in Colorado.If you come there for five weeks, we\ncan do an intense boot camp where Itry to skill you up and get you to\nlearn your first scale and your firstetude, which you will need to pass\nthe Juilliard audition and also maybe,hopefully get you to read music a little\nbit better than you can right now.And I went to that summer\ncamp, and I worked my butt off.I mean, you're also in this incredibly\nintensive environment where everyone yourage is there and they're all practicing\nlike their age equivalent, right?And so I felt very inspired by that.And I ended up getting\ninto Juilliard in the fall.And it was such a wonderful reminder that\nwhen opportunities are not served on asilver platter for you, you just have to\nhave this kind of imaginative courage.And what my mom had that day.To figure out a path from point A to\npoint B, she really just created aplate for me and said, like, okay,\nyou're prepared for this thing.We're going to get you\nin front of this teacher.And that's a lesson I've\nused time and time again.When I felt like there was\nsomething cool I could be doing,the opportunity did not exist.So, for example, when I was in the\nWhite House, the job that I wanted,which was to be a practitioner of\nbehavioral science, did not exist.And so I sent cold emails and I pitched\nthem on the idea of creating a newposition for a behavioral science advisor.And then I said, hey, by the way, if\nyou create this position, could you alsoconsider hiring me to play that job,\neven though I've had no public policyexperience and I've been an academic\nfor the entirety of my adult life?And they said yes.And so it was such an energizing\nlesson to learn as a young kid, whichis like, you can do the cold call.Oftentimes there's few consequences.You'll just get rejected.I mean, that's truly the worst\nthing that's going to happen.But it's one thing to be told\nthat, it's another thing to havelived the experience out and to see\nhow amazing the aftermath can be.And that's what I got to\nexperience as a young kid.Andrew Huberman: Amazing.So let's all express some thanks to\nyour mom for barging in the door,and to you, because you also had the\nagency to do the audition on the spot.I think a lot of kids and adults\nwould have thought, I'm not ready, I'mnot going to do this, but it takes a\ncertain gumption to just do it, right,and also to integrate the feedback.And then I'm curious about this camp.I went to a few camps of different\ntypes, crashed a few camps.That's a different story.Turns out if you show up, you can\nget by for a few days before theyrealize that you're not one of\nthe main, oh, yeah, no, there's awhole other set of stories there.Maya Shankar: I love it.Andrew Huberman: But I'm curious.You're among very driven,\nmaybe even obsessive kids.Were they nice to one another?Do you recall the kid that was the best?Maya Shankar: Oh, yeah.Rachel Lee.Andrew Huberman: There you go.Isn't this incredible?Maya Shankar: Oh, my God.Andrew Huberman: We remember these names.Maya Shankar: Yeah.Total prodigy.I bristle when people say, Maya\nwas a young violin prodigy.I'm like, no, I wasn't.And there's no false\nhumility in my saying that.I just actually saw what prodigies\nwere like and I was not one of them.I mean, truly, just talk\nabout awe-inspiring.I'm like, how is it that music\ncomes so effortlessly to Rachel?I feel like she was born\nwith a violin in her hands.I mean, that's how it felt\nwhenever I watched her play.And it's a double-edged sword.On the one hand, you're deriving\ninspiration from the incredibletalent you see around you.On the other hand, you feel demoralized\nso often because you're runningup against whatever limitations\nexist when it comes to yournatural talent and your work ethic.At the end of the day, I was never\nthe hardest working violinist.My mom insisted that we\nwere well-rounded kids.I played soccer all\nthrough elementary school.I auditioned for the school play,\nReally Rosie , I did art classes.It was just really important\nto both my parents.I think that we had just,\nlike, relatively normal lives.And I was studying alongside kids\nwho had literally left half theirfamilies behind in their home country,\nhad moved with one parent to a studioapartment in Manhattan or in Colorado\nfor this camp, and were devotingtheir entire lives to this pursuit.And so I felt like, I\nwas a super envious kid.Like, I was always looking around, being\nlike, I suck, and they're great, right?We talked about having a\nself-critical personality--Andrew Huberman: --I think\na lot of kids feel that way.I think at that age, and this\nsometimes extends into adulthood,"

            "text": "we have this tendency to try and\nfind benchmarks of where we are.And sometimes that turns\ninto a hierarchical thing,sometimes very lateralized.But trying to figure out where you\nare in the landscape of things, itjust seems like it's fundamental\nto the teenage experience.Maya Shankar: Yeah, your\nuniverse shrinks, too, right?So you're no longer getting access to what\nthe average kid violinist sounds like.I mean, you're in the elite of the elite.And so it's so intimidating.And I felt like what happened\nis, especially when I became ateenager, so two things happened\nwhen I became a teenager.The first is that my violin life\njust started to speed forward.So Itzhak Perlman invited me to be\nhis private violin student, consideredthe best violinist in the world.It was an incredible experience.I felt so overwhelmed,\neven by the opportunity.I'd also stumbled upon MTV and was like,\ndo I even want to do classical music?Like, Britney Spears is\ndoing much cooler things?So that was my version of teenage\nrebellion, was coming home fromschool, and what I should have\nbeen practicing, watching MTV.But the other thing that happened is I\nwent through the natural teenage process,which is I became very self-conscious.I became more insecure.I was trying to figure\nout who I was, who I am.And I think that was the period of\nmy life, my high school years, whenI was the least happy as a violinist.So I described to you earlier that\nincredibly awe-inspiring experience oflistening to the Beethoven Violin concerto\nand it feeling otherworldly and feelinglike I could see a world beyond my own\npersonal wants and needs and desires.It really made me feel small against\nthe backdrop of this magnificent world.And I liked that feeling of smallness.And when I was in my teenage\nyears, we're all in this highlynarcissistic state of mind.We're consumed with\nourselves and how we feel.And I just felt like I gave some of my\nworst performances when I was a teenager.And I often found, to your point, about\nthese pressure cooker environments.My best performances were\nactually just to the public.My worst performances were\nwhen I was in my little studio,having to play for my peers.That just sapped all the joy\nout for me because I was just,like, really tough on myself.And that was a period of time\nwhere I lost touch with whatit is that I loved about music.And of course, there's an ebb and flow.I had magical experiences playing the\nviolin when I was a high schooler.But I just think if you were to do the\naverage of joy, like pre twelve andthen post twelve, the average joy was\nmuch higher before I became a teenager.Andrew Huberman: Yeah, there's so\nmany things to extrapolate from that.I really feel that when we get into\na mode of trying to hit milestonesthat are extrinsic, that it really can\nundermine our love of what we're doing.But if we keep going and we can\nreframe what those external rewardsare, in part by just realizing that\nthey're so transient compared tothe delight that we can experience.What I mean is that I don't think\nof delight as something that wellsup in us and then dissipates.I think of it as something that\nchanges our nervous system in a waythat gives us access to new abilities.I really do.I mean, being a faculty member at\nStanford, you look to your left, youlook to your right, and it's like\nliterally in the building, I mean,I've got a Nobel prize winner below me.Like the people by me I've got\nMacArthur award winners all over theplace, like everywhere you turn, and\nthese people do other things, too.So also D1 athletes, and they've\ngot five kids, and all theirkids seem to be doing great.Who are these people?And it becomes very important in that\nenvironment to just shrink your spirits,like, what's one foot in front of you and\njust keep going and not pay attention.But it's hard to do, not by way of\ncomparison, because I actually getexcited about being immersed in a\ngroup where everyone's doing well.I do think being among all these\nother incredibly talented and driven,although you carefully said, and\nimportantly said rather, that you didnot see yourself as talented, it's\nvery clear that you have a ton of gritand hard work clearly went into it.I think that word talent can be\na little bit misleading, so wewant to underscore the fact that\nyou've worked incredibly hard.But I think that it's a tough thing.It's hard for us to develop much in\nisolation, and it's also hard forus to stay connected to the source.Maya Shankar: Yes, exactly.Andrew Huberman: And that's a word\nthat I stole from a former guest onthis podcast and a good friend of mine\nwho's the great Rick Rubin, one ofthe most successful music producers,\nrock and roll music producers of all.Maya Shankar: I loved that interview.Andrew Huberman: He talks about\nthe source, so there are so manydifferent trails we could go down here.Just one thing, briefly, is I,\nagain, am completely miserable atmusic, but I once saw Itzhak Perlman\nin the airport with his family.I was with my father, who's a\nhuge classical music fan, and wewatched him, and he said, watch.And it turns out he was\ngetting onto our plane.He sat in first class next to his,\nI presume, Stradivarius violin.His violin got a first class seat.He got a first class seat, and\nhis family sat across from him.And my dad said his violin is so important\nthat it gets its own first class seat.I couldn't believe it.So great.In any event--Maya Shankar: --I think, just one t\nhing to your point, one reflectionI've had, and this kind of goes back\nto this question of identity, which iswhen you are in these very competitive\nenvironments, and again, I'm sure alot of people listening are in very\ncompetitive environments, you feel thatso much can be taken away from you,\njust in terms of mental well being,because you're always looking at the\nworld through a comparative lens.You're benchmarking yourself,\nas you said, like there's abenchmark, and where do I fall on\nthe continuum of mediocre to great?I don't know, and yesterday I had\na terrible performance, so that'sgoing to set me back, etc., etc.I have found that when I re-anchor\nmyself to what Rick Rubin referredto as the source and identify the\ncharacteristics of music or otherpursuits, that really energizes me.It feels like I'm actually insulated\nfrom a lot of the external noise,and I bring a lot more clarity and\nfocus to the work that I do every day.So there's two things that I think\ndefine me as a person, at least rightnow, I allow for that malleability.One is that I'm a deeply curious person.And the second is that I really\nrelish getting better at things.I love seeing progress internally.And in my violin life, no one could\ntake those two things away from me.In my current life as a cognitive\nscientist, as a podcaster, youjust can't take those from me.No one can take that joy from me.And it feels protective in a\nreally important way, whichis, for example, just like you.I mean, I see the labor of love that\nyou put into the Huberman Lab podcast.It's extraordinary.I put so much time and energy and\nthoughtfulness and love into making ASlight Change of Plans , but at the end\nof the day, when you put the episodeout into the world, you just don't get\nto control what the reaction is, right?Your favorite episode might\nnot be everyone else's favoriteepisode, and that's just\nsomething you have to deal with.But what I found is that if I really\nrelished the process of making theepisode, it fed that curiosity.And I got better as an interviewer,\nI got better as a thinker.I got more clarity on a topic\nthat I was curious about.I mean, it gives me a foundation\nthat feels really sturdy.Do you know what I mean?Andrew Huberman: Yeah, w ell, those\nthings are intrinsic to you, andthey are, I guess, now we're using\nnomenclature, but they're not what wewould call domain-specific, like the\ncuriosity, the desire for progressthrough effort and through focus.Those are music.They're not music irrelevant,\nbut they're music independent.And that actually brings me to a\nvery important component of yourwork and your life arc, which\nis this notion of recreating and"

            "text": "refinding identity in new endeavors.So if I understand correctly, and\nhopefully you'll embellish on this, youhad the unfortunate, perhaps unfortunate\nexperience of playing the violin and theninjuring your finger very badly to the\npoint where it was, at least for yourmusic career, career ending, absolutely.And that happened when you were how old?Maya Shankar: I was 15.Andrew Huberman: So given how much of\nyour identity and energy was put intoviolin, that must have been devastating.And yet you've obviously, I don't want\nto say re-created yourself, because Ilike the idea that this essence within\nyou has many opportunities and forms.And I like it as an example for everybody\nhaving some essence of many things thatcould give them delight, and that it's\nsomething about the feelings associatedwith a given choice of occupation or hobby\nor behavior, or perhaps relationship.Relationships end sometimes by\ndecision, death or otherwise,and people are devastated.Their identities are completely, at\nleast in their minds, obliterated.And then people have this\namazing ability to recreatethemselves and new circumstances.So if you could take us back to the time\nwhen you were 15, you have this injury.What was your initial mindset in the\ndays and weeks after that a nd then,if you would, could you link that up\nto some of what I see as incrediblyimportant work that you've done,\nhelping people understand not justwho they are, but how to identify the\ncomponents of who they are that are trulyindomitable, that just cannot go away.Like, your drive for\ncuriosity and hard work--.Maya Shankar: --And human connection.Yeah.In the days and weeks and months\nand year after, I felt terrible.It was awful because I think, in my case,\nalso, when you're a kid who's reallybubbly and energetic, you just kind\nof move forward, and you don't alwaysthink about how identity defining the\nthing you're doing is you just do it.And so it was really interesting, I\nthink, in losing the violin, that'sactually when it became so salient\nto me how much the instrument hadmeant to me and had defined who I was.And so I felt a dampening of\nsome of my more organic traits.Like, I was less curious for a long time.Andrew Huberman: I'm going\nto interrupt you on purpose.I apologize.But at the same time, I'm not apologizing,\nbecause there was something that yousaid in a prior discussion that just\nkeeps ringing in my mind, which isthat your body and your nervous system\nactually grew up around the violin.That, to me, was just.I will never forget that statement.I want to also thank you for it,\nbecause that, to me, is perhaps the mostprofound way to describe an experience\nof identity, is that your nervous systemin your body isn't growing up with\nsomething or alongside it, but thatmuch like a relationship of a human\nkind, humankind, that your body isactually developing around this object.Maya Shankar: It absolutely\ndeveloped around the ergonomicsof playing the violin.So, to this day, my right\nshoulder is slightly elevatedrelative to my left because of\nall the hours I spent doing this.It makes strength training really\nannoying because I always have this slightimbalance, and I have a light scoliosis in\nmy spine as well, also from this posture.And, yeah, it feels intimate in a way.It's like, wow, the shape of my body.Like, my architecture was\ndefined by this instrument.And so it's left this indelible\nimprint on me that will never go away.And I think that a lot of us\nfeel this disorientation, right?So it might not be that you lost the\nability to do something you love.It could be that you lost\nsomeone that you love.It could be that you lost\nyour mojo or whatever.I mean, there's so many types of\nloss and so many kinds of griefwe all experience as human beings.And I think in all those cases, again,\nit really feels like the rug has beenpulled out from under you because\nthis thing that gave you so muchmeaning and so much purpose and so\nmuch energy in life no longer exists.And so I think, for a while, yeah, I\nfelt kind of like, lost at sea, andI assumed I'll never find anything\nthat I'm as passionate about.And I think, what my dad did for me at\nthat, you know, theoretical physicist.So he's an academic, and he said,\nI think you should just read a lot.Just, like, read a bunch of stuff.And I was like, okay, I mean,\nI'm supposed to be in China thissummer touring with my classmates.I am at home in Connecticut with my\nparents, perusing their bookshelf.So, like, slightly less\ncool summer situation.But I had a lot of time on my\nhands because I wasn't in Shanghai.So I started perusing the bookshelf,\nand then I came across this popscience book called the Language\nInstinct by Stephen Pinker.And that was a turning point for me.I mean, I was headed to\ncollege maybe later that year.I opened up this book, and it\ndetailed our marvelous ability tocomprehend and produce language.And up until this point in my life,\nI had completely taken languageabilities for granted, just like\nsomething that I did, and I justkind of learned it along the way.And when Pinker pulled the curtain\nback and revealed how sophisticated andcomplex the cognitive machinery is that's\noperating behind the scenes that givesrise to language, my mind was truly blown.I was like, wow.I never thought about it, it's not\nlike we are with three year olds,not like we sit down with them\nand we're like, this is a gerund.This is a past participle, whatever.They just learn because they have these\nkind of light switches in their brainthat are activated on and off depending\non what language they're learning.And it was so fascinating to\nlearn about language development,about neurolinguistics,\nabout syntax and semantics.I just remember thinking,\nlanguage is fascinating.Cognition is fascinating.And I'm also now wondering about all\nthese other systems that are in place.So this is what's involved in language.What's involved in the complex\nmath equations our dads do, right?Like, what's involved in, what's the\nmental processing behind a new discoveryor an insight or an aha moment or\nfalling in love or falling out of love.I mean, it just lit up my imagination.And very similar to you, Andrew, I\nlove that we have this connection.You said when you learned about\nneurobiology and neuroscience,"

            "text": "discovery of something new.Was it at that point that you\nrealized the feeling of excitementthat I'm getting from learning about\nneurolinguistics and related topicsis somehow similar to the excitement\nthat I was feeling about the violin, ormaybe even superseded that excitement?I mean, at what point were you able\nto make the pivot with confidencethat this is the new trajectory?And an important component of that\nthat I'd like to understand is youalso had to cut ties with the past,\nsomething that's very hard to do.I mean, I grew up with a\nnumber of kids who became verysuccessful teen athletes, really.And some of them, once they ceased\nto keep up or they had an injuryor something, their identity stayed\nattached to the past in a way thatdid not allow them to move forward.Fortunately, many of them\ndid find new identities inbusiness or in other endeavors.Some became quite successful.But I've seen very often that when people\nachieve early success and then theyhit a cliff, that it's very hard for\nthem to part with that former identity.There's one of the\nperils of early success.Maya Shankar: Yeah, I wouldn't say\nthat it superseded the excitementthat I had with the violin.I would say the quality of the\nexcitement felt very different.And that's actually important to\nconvey because I think when someoneloses the ability to have a passion,\nthey're seeking exactly the same sensoryexperience, exactly the same high that\nthey experienced the first time around.And I think that's a really high bar.And sometimes it's more of an\napples and oranges type situation.So with the violin, there was a really\ndeep sensory aspect to the experience.I mean, I felt things, right,\nyou're playing and then you'refeeling things emotionally.And it all felt super visceral, and\nthat was where the passion emerged from.It was just this very visceral\nfeeling of, like, this is sobeautiful and awesome, and I love it.With the cognitive science\nstuff, my intellectual brain wasdelighted, and it's just like a\ndifferent expression of passion.I think the big pressure test was not\nif I had held myself to the bar of do Ilove this as much as the violin, there's\nno way that I would have been confidentenough to pursue anything at that point.So instead, I really think the question\nI asked myself at that time, which wasa service to me and my more compromised\npsychology, was, am I curious enough aboutthis thing to ask more questions about it?Do I want to learn more?And I found, naturally, three days\nlater, I went to the library, and I gotanother book on the cognitive science\nof language, and then I got a bookon the science of decision making.So there was curiosity, and\nhonestly, that was all I needed.That was the little seedling that I needed\nto see if it could go somewhere more.I took that as a very strong signal.Like, I care to learn more\nabout this, and I don't care tolearn about everything, right?And I remember perusing the course\nbook of my undergrad institution,and they had a cognitive science\nmajor, which was awesome becausenot all schools had one at the time.It was a very new major.It's interdisciplinary.You approach questions of the\nmind from multiple perspectives.So from the perspective of neuroscience,\nlinguistics, philosophy, psychology,computer science, and anthropology.So you're just like a bunch\nof different disciplines.But that was when I thought, ooh, I can\nat least see if I can get into this major.I remember it was,\nlike, a selective major.It was selective.And so I freaked out, of course,\nand had super impostor syndrome.It was like, I'm not going\nto get into the program.But thankfully, I got in, and I think\nthat's where I was able to connect,like, this little seedling of curiosity\nto the actual pursuit of the thing.And that's a really important translation,\nbecause there can often be a mismatch.You're really passionate about something,\nbut you actually hate the process.Like, you hate the actual work that's\ninvolved in getting better at it.And I was lucky in my undergrad because\nI fought my way, my mom style, barginginto classes that really would only\naccept seniors or juniors, and I waslike, I'm a lowly freshman, but accept me.And I was able to run experiments\non adults, and I was actually ableto see what it would be like to be\na researcher, to ask novel questionsand to get the delight that you feel\nright when you're in a lab and you'reactually testing out new hypotheses.And so it was really important that\nI saw that I not only was excited,but that I could actually enjoy parts\nof the process of getting better.Andrew Huberman: I love your description\nof curiosity because it makes me thinkthat in some way, it has something\nto do with a deep motivation anddesire to figure out what's next or\nwhat's around the corner without anemotional attachment to the outcome.Curiosity is really just trying to\nfigure out what's there as opposed tohoping that something specific is there.And sometimes even the surprises are\nmore exciting than our predictions.I think the quote was\ninitially from Dorothy Parker.I think this is debated,\nbut I think it was.\"The cure for boredom is curiosity.There is no cure for curiosity.\"Maya Shankar: Oh, that's awesome.I hadn't heard that.Andrew Huberman: Yeah, I believe\nit was Dorothy Parker, sometimesmisattributed to Agatha Christie,\nbut I think it was Dorothy Parker.And what I love about it is that there's\nsomething about curiosity, that whenit's genuine, it's self-amplifying.It's an upward spiral,\nbecause there is no endpoint.Right?I mean, that's one of the things that\nyou learn early in science, is youlearn, you test hypotheses, you get\nanswers, and you get more questions,and you form hypotheses, and you\ndo that until you die, basically.And they can be a little bit dark.But when you think about it as a journey,\nthat it's just so much fun along the way.If you're just really interested in\nknowing what the answers are withoutgetting too attached to the answers, it\njust feels like, even as I'm describingit now, they just can just fill you\nup, and it provides more energy forthe next round and the next round.And that really came through in your\ndescription of cognitive science.I also find it interesting\nthat you couldn't read sheetmusic, at least not very well.You were so deeply immersed in\nan endeavor, violin playing,that is not of verbal language.And then you went into a field that's\nabout, or initially, you were sparkedan interest in a field through an\nunderstanding of verbal language.And earlier you said that the thing\nthat bridges the violin and what came"

            "text": "next as a passion and pursuit was\nthis desire for human connection.At what point did you realize that?And here I do want to emphasize that\nwhile we're talking about your story,I hope, I can only imagine that people\nare starting to think about what arethe intrinsic points of motivation for\nwhat they're doing and what they'vedone, asking the sorts of questions\nthat I hope everyone is asking.What is it really that motivates\nme to love this and to seea place for myself in that?Because those are ultimately,\nI think, the questions thateveryone should and can ask.Maya Shankar: Yeah, it\ntook me a really long time.It's actually only been in the last\nfew years that I've discovered this.I discovered this as a result of\ncreating A Slight Change of Plans . Somy desire to create the show came\nfrom a very personal place, whichis that I'm terrified of change.So even though I've had these\nformative experiences withchange, I'm a creature of habit.I'm willing to change my habits.For example, I now take caffeine\n90 minutes after I get up.Andrew Huberman: How's\nthat working for you?Maya Shankar: Very well, even today.Okay.I'm a good disciple.[LAUGHS]Andrew Huberman: Well, I like\nto think that people affordthemselves some flexibility if\nyou got to run to the airport--Maya Shankar: --60 to 90 minutes.Andrew Huberman: [LAUGHS] 60 and\n90, or the occasional within 30minutes if you have to, but nobody's\nperfect, nor should we strive.Maya Shankar: I'm a student.I'm willing to update my habits,\nbut I'm a creature of habit.And there's a couple of reasons why\nwe, as humans, are scared of change.And I think one of them, which\nis incredibly relatable, is thatchange is filled with a lot of\nuncertainty, and we hate uncertainty.We will go to irrational\nlengths to avoid uncertainty.So one of my favorite studies\ncoming out of cognitive sciencesis one involving electric shocks.And what they found is that people are\nfar more stressed when they're told theyhave a 50% chance of getting an electric\nshock than when they're told they have a100% chance of getting an electric shock.So we would rather be sure, certain\nthat a bad thing is going to happenthan to have to deal with any\nfeelings of uncertainty and ambiguity.Andrew Huberman: Right.That result, I love that\nyou brought up that result.It still is bewildering to me,\nbecause if you think about it,100% trial to trial shock means you\nhave to take on the okay, bring it,just bring it on kind of mentality.But if you did that for every\ntrial and then half of thetrials, you don't get shocked.We know there's a dopamine release from\nthe lack of punishment, so the idealstrategy is the same, and yet somehow,\npeople are averse to the uncertainty.Maya Shankar: Yeah, we don't\nlike uncertainty, even though,again, the uncertainty is what\ndrives that dopamine first.And yet we bristle, certainly,\nat that uncertainty.And so I definitely am like,\nplease, status quo, everyone,I would love the status quo.Even when the status quo has\nbeen suboptimal, Andrew, I'vebeen fine with the status quo.So part of it came from my desire\nto figure out, okay, how is it...Like, A Slight Change of Plans , marries\nscience and storytelling to help us figureout strategies for better managing change.So I wanted to figure out, how are\npeople coming to terms with uncertainty?One of the things that I realized I\nlearned from the guests on my showand also the scientists, is there's\nthis concept called cognitive closure,and it is the need to arrive at\nclear, definitive answers to things.It's basically the opposite of this\nopen ended curiosity that you justdescribed, which is with cognitive\nclosure, you have a need to, you aren'tindifferent towards what the answers are.You aren't indifferent towards\nwhat the questions are.You care about everything.You care about micromanaging\nevery part of the curiousprocess from point A to point B.And there's a lot of research showing\nthat when we reduce our need forcognitive closure, when we become a\nlittle bit more open to the unbidden,to mystery, more open to awe-inspiring\nexperiences, we can experience huge boostsin well being, and we can become a lot\nmore resilient in the face of change.So that's something that I'm working\non, which is like, okay, maybe I canreduce my need for cognitive closure.And the other thing that I am starting\nto appreciate is one reason that weget change wrong and we maybe fear\nit more than we should, is that whenwe anticipate what a change will be\nlike in the future, we tend to imaginehow our present day selves will\nrespond to that future change, right?So it's almost like a magic mirror.It's Maya in present day, going\nthrough this mirror, comes outthe other side two years from now.She's the one who's overcoming\nthe challenges of a diagnosisor some other life change.And what we forget is that the\nbig changes in our lives canchange us in pretty profound ways.And when we recognize and we\nall fall prey to this illusion.It's called the end of history illusion.So, this is work by Dan Gilbert.And basically what it says is\nwe fully acknowledge that we'vechanged considerably in the past.So you think back to your\nskateboard days, right?I think back to my high school\ndays, and I think, oh, mygosh, of course I've changed.I would be embarrassed to\nlisten to any interview I gavewhen I was younger, right?Like, what were the thoughts\nI was even thinking?So we will see it, absolutely.We were totally different\nten years ago, 20 years ago.But when it comes to thinking about\nthe future and projecting into thefuture, we are absolutely convinced that\nwho we are right now, in this momentis the person that's here to stay.And that can lead us astray when\nit comes to thinking about how wewill respond to change, because we\nforget that there's actually a lotof wiggle room around who we become.And to your point, I mean, I love\nthe point you made about curiosity.What that means is we want to be\ncurious, not just about the things we do.We want to be curious about ourselves.One huge lesson that I've learned\nfrom the interviews that I've hadon A Slight Change of Plans is that\nI need to constantly be auditingmyself through my change experience\nto figure out how I have changed.Because when we experience change,\nit doesn't happen in a vacuum.So let's say I get a promotion or I\nenter into a relationship, or I leavea relationship or some other, again,\nnarrow slice of my life is altered.We can think of that change as\nhappening in a vacuum, right?As being confined to just the unique\narea of our life that change exists in.But, of course, we are\nincredibly complex creatures.Our psychology is incredibly complex.We live in these remarkably\ncomplex ecosystems.Change in one area of our life will\ninevitably have spillover effects intoall other parts of our lives in ways\nthat are extremely hard to predict.I think a lot of your listeners are\nfamiliar with the research showing we'rereally bad cognitive forecasters, right?We're bad at predicting what's going\nto make us happy, what's going to makeus sad, how long we're going to be\nsad, how long we're going to be happy.Well, one of the reasons for that is\nthat we forget that we are a dynamicentity that might change as well.That our preferences might change,\nour choice, that might change,we might change in these really\nprofound ways that we don't realize.I think there's an inspiring message\ncoming out of this, which is, one, whatwe're capable of right now really might\nnot be what we're capable of later,and what I found in my own experience\nis that it's interesting when itcomes to our self-perception, because\nwe have a first person perspectiveon who we are, we tend to think\nthat we have a very comprehensive,veridical understanding of who we are.Like, I have a pretty good grasp of who\nI, Maya, am and what I'm capable of andwhat I value and what my identity is.But the reality is that that understanding\nis based on the random set of datapoints that I've happened to collect\nover the course of my lifetime, basedon the random set of experiences\nand opportunities and failures andsuccesses that I've happened to have.Right?Andrew Huberman: And if I'm not\nmistaken, there's a salience to thenegative experiences, often for reasons\nthat make sense according to nervoussystems that want to keep us safe, etc.But, for instance, you remember\nthe name of this child prodigy--Maya Shankar: --Rachel Lee.[LAUGHS]Andrew Huberman: Rachel Lee.[LAUGHS] My sister still talks about,\nI won't say their names because we knowthat these people are still around,\nfortunately, the names of some of thegirls in junior high school that were\nparticularly popular and perhaps not--Maya Shankar: --You mean Kellen Lindsay?[LAUGHS]Andrew Huberman: [LAUGHS] Yeah, perhaps\nnot kind to her, right, exactly.Maya Shankar: Were they nice to me?Not super nice, but it's okay.Andrew Huberman: Yeah.There's a lot of web searching\nnowadays for what thesepeople are up to now anyway.Not by me, anyway.I have a sister.We occasionally touch into this.She's doing great.Fortunately, there's a salience\nto the negative experiences.But I think what I'm hearing, and\nI totally agree with, is that we'd"

            "text": "like to think that we have complete\nor at least adequate self-knowledge,but that we likely don't.What are some of the ways that we\ncan get better data on ourselvesin ways that can help us?Is that through the\napplication of mentorship?Is it asking people for an honest\nassessment of us with, of course, thewillingness to hear what they have to say?What are some of the, I love zero cost\nbehavioral, but what are some of the zerocost behavioral sources that people have\naround them in order to ask these, whatI think are really fundamental questions.Maya Shankar: Yeah.So there's two information asymmetries,\nlet's say, that we're trying tosolve for, s o two areas where we\nmight not have full knowledge ofwho we are for one of two reasons.So, one is that we have an incomplete\nunderstanding of who we are just basedon the random set of experiences.And the second is that going through this\nbig change actually alters us in some way.Okay, so if we're trying to solve for\nthe, I think the second problem isactually easier to solve for in that\nwe often just don't even know to lookinwards during a big change to see\nhow we've changed because we think,oh, I'll just pay attention to how I'm\nperforming at work because that was thenew variable that was thrown into my life.And we forget to evaluate\nother parts of our lives.Like, what impact has this\nhad on my relationship?What impact has this had\non my overall well being?Am I different?Do I have a different set of preferences?Do I care about different things?So, in the second category, become very\ninquisitive about who you are over alonger time frame and assume that it's not\na static state when it comes to the firstbucket, which is how do we develop a more\ncomplete and richer understanding of self?I think it's actually about\nsurrounding yourself with a diverseset of people, people that you\nwouldn't naturally gravitate towards.I think this solves for a bunch of\nsocial ills, which is that, again, wetend to live in our silos, and we're\nreally averse to talking to peoplewho have different points of view.But I will tell you, at times I've\nlearned the most about myself, I'velearned the most about my weaknesses and\nsometimes my strengths from talking withsomeone that I vehemently disagree with.And it's a really hard thing to do.It's very painful.But in terms of edifying experiences go.It's through those conversations\nthat I almost see thismirror reflected back on me.Like, wow, I'm much more aware of\nhow I'm coming across to that personbecause they disagree with me about\nsomething or they're not someoneI would normally fraternize with.And it's just bred more\nself-awareness in me.And so I would encourage people\nto actually seek out connectionsin uncomfortable spaces because\nthat will allow you to fillin at least some of the gaps.Now, some of the gaps will\ntruly only be revealed to youbecause of life experiences.So, I'm thinking in my own\nlife, I thought I grieved ina very particular kind of way.And then during COVID my husband\nand I experienced multiple pregnancylosses with our surrogate, and\nI found myself grieving in a waythat was completely foreign to me.I don't think talking to anyone\nwould have revealed to me that I wasgoing to grieve in this way where\nusually I would reach out to peopleand I would want to stay connected.And I became so shut off and closed\noff, and I didn't want to talk toanyone for days after the losses.I was so disoriented there.I learned, oh, actually, you can respond\nin a diverse set of ways to grief.You don't have a singular experience\nwith grief, but I might haveonly learned that from the actual\nexperience of confronting it.That said, I do think there's a\nlot of value in trying to fill ingaps in knowledge or self-awareness\nthrough these more quotidianconversations you have with people.Andrew Huberman: I love, love, love\nwhat you said about deliberately placingoneself into environments where we receive\ncritical feedback from people that weview as quite disparate from us, at\nleast in terms of our experience of them.It was the great Karl Deisseroth, another\nincredibly accomplished neuroscientist,happens to be a colleague of mine at\nStanford who, he's a psychiatrist, and hesaid, you know, we think we know how other\npeople feel, but we really have no ideahow other people feel unless we ask them.In fact, most of the time we don't\neven really know how we feel.We're not very good at\ngauging our own emotions.So credit to Karl for\nmaking that statement.But with that said, I think getting\na sense of how other people seeus, and disagreement in particular,\ncan be incredibly informative.Maya Shankar: I just want to say one other\npoint on this, which is I think gettingfeedback from others almost gets a bad\nrap these days in society, because it'slike you should only care about who you\nare inside, who you know yourself to be.And I'm like, dude, we\nare social creatures.It absolutely matters\nhow I come off to others.I think that should be a huge\npart of my self-identity,should be how I impact others.And I think we should be\nshameless about integrating thatinto our understanding of self.If I feel like I'm an excellent person\ninside and I'm regularly woundingthe people around me, that matters,\nthat's relevant to how I see myself.And so I do worry sometimes with the\ncurrent cultural climate that we'repushing ourselves so much towards\nthe space of, like, all that mattersis authenticity and being yourself.First of all, sometimes\nyourself isn't awesome.You might want to actually\noptimize or change some thingsabout yourself to be better.I think that's a good thing.And then, second, it's okay to\ncare what other people think.Usually they're great barometers of\nthings that you might not be aware ofin terms of the impact you're having.So I just want to be a lobbyist\nfor caring what other peoplethink, just for a moment.Andrew Huberman: Yeah, I agree.This is one of the reasons why I say\nat the end of every episode that Ido read all the comments on YouTube.Maya Shankar: Me too!Andrew Huberman: I think I was\nraised in a culture, an academicculture, where feedback on lectures,\nstudent feedback, was critical.I mean, it is important, I believe,\nto be a selective filter, because inthe old days, we'll say, there was\nan opportunity to map the statementsto the grade that the student\nreceived, you can no longer do this.So you would often see that some of the\nworst feedback was, \"hated, unclear\"...Maya Shankar: Exactly.Andrew Huberman: And then you'd look at\ntheir grade, and you'd say, well, okay,this helps explain, and yet it was also\nimportant to understand where that couldhave represented some failings on my part.And a classroom is but one environment.I think the online environment is\nwhere this gets tricky because ofthe way that we all differ in our\ncapacity to receive critical feedback.And sometimes the harshness of one\nform of feedback sends people feelingback on their heels or feeling even\nego or emotionally injured in waysthat they actually feel traumatic.And I think that's part of the problem, is\nthat we don't really have a way to gauge,I mean, we know inappropriate when we see\nit, we know appropriate when we see it.But all the stuff in between,\nbecause it's on a continuum,really is where it gets tricky.I certainly think integrating the\npossibility that somebody might be right,what is it that they say in certain\nforms of personal developments, like, ifsomebody's coming at you with an argument\nabout you, the best state of mind youcould have is you might be right, because\nthat lets you hold your ground a bit.It still maintains a boundary, but\nyou're not saying you're right,and you're not saying you're wrong.You're in a kind of a flat footed\nstance where you could move either way.And I like that.This idea of, well, they might be\nright, and then you could say no or yes.But in any case, I just want to\nthrow up both hands and as manyvotes as I can, as one individual\nto say yes, I totally agree.More direct feedback and\ndisagreement is great.Maya Shankar: Yeah.Andrew Huberman: It's wonderful.And I think in science, you're used\nto people saying harsh things aboutyour work until they eventually say,\nokay, you c an publish the paper.Maya Shankar: [LAUGHS] That is true.Andrew Huberman: I grew up in the\nculture of skateboarding, wherenothing's good enough, and then\noccasionally something's good.And in the landscape of podcasting, I\nthink the comment section is a greatway to get feedback, and that's why\nI continue to encourage feedback.It sounds like you do as well.Maya Shankar: Yeah,

it'sactually not, like, strong convictions.It's actually a willingness to\nupdate her opinions on things,her belief systems, her strategy\nbased on incoming information.I really, really pride myself on\nhaving a flexible mindset aboutstuff and not being stubborn.This is true in my marriage.Like, my husband Jimmy and I\nreally pride ourselves, youknow, saying, you know what?Based on what you just\nshared, I'm changing my mind.Like, you're right and I'm wrong.And if you can actually start to\nvalue that, if you could start tosee that as a virtuous quality.I think historically, when we think\nabout leadership, we've thought aboutpeople who are incredibly resolute in\ntheir convictions, but that doesn't allowthe space to, again, beige an update.Update your mindset when you get new\ninformation or you realize that youerred in some way in terms of the\nlogic that you used or what have you.And I've been extremely intentional\nin every sphere that I've worked into have this very open mind and to\nbe very open to critical feedback.It does not mean that I take\nevery piece of feedback.Okay, obviously I have some criteria I\nuse to decide whether it's meaningfulfeedback or it's not meaningful feedback.But the locus of my pride is not in being\nright or having the strong conviction.It is actually in my willingness\nto have a more dynamic state ofmind regarding lots of issues.Maybe that's just what it\nmeans to be a scientist, right?Like, you have to be willing to\nupdate in the face of new information.Andrew Huberman: I am nodding\nfor those that are listening.I'm just nodding and\nthinking yes and more yes.Because I think that we all need\nmore of that as individuals.And if we can't get it from our work\nsetting or group setting, sometimesasking a friend can be extremely useful.I have a friend.He happens to be a professor\nat a university back east.I won't embarrass him by disclosing\nwhere he's at, but I recall as a juniorfaculty member because he knows me well.He's a few years behind me\nin our career trajectories.But asking him for an honest\nassessment, I asked for the mostbrutally honest assessment of me that\nhe could give, and some of it stung.Some of it stung.He was relating some ways in which I show\nup as a friend and I'm super present.Then I have this tendency, I'm\npretty introverted, I'll disappearfor long periods of time.In college, they called me Dart\nbecause I'd show up at parties.I'd be there, and then I would disappear\nfor like two weeks and just be in mybooks, say hi to people and just keep\ngoing sort of in and out of connection.I've worked hard to change\nthat over the years.I think I have.But who knows?In any event, a friend who knows\nus well that you insist on.All right, don't give me any compliments.Just give me the harsh stuff\nthat can be very useful.Maya Shankar: And that reminds me\nof some research by Ethan Cross.So he looks at how we can\ntame our mental chatter.And if you don't have the friend available\nto you, there is a really easy distancingtechnique that you can use when you're\nin the throes of a problem where you aretrying to actively reframe something or\nmaybe see where your blind spots are.And that's by thinking about your\nproblem from a third person perspectiveversus a first person perspective.So you play the role of someone who's\ngiving advice to a friend in your head,but that friend is actually you, and\nit actually promotes some degree ofobjectivity and emotional distance from,\nagain, that fuzzy, hazy set of feelingsthat you have around the emotion.You're trying to get rid of that piece\nso that you can bring a slightly moresober recommendation to the situation.So that can be really helpful.And then the other thing to do is, I\nthink, when we're facing challenges, whenwe're going through a hard time, we do\nhave an instinct to want to vent, right?Again, in this era of vulnerability\nand whatnot, we're told, like, yes,share everything that's on your mind.It can actually be\ncounterproductive to vent.And the reason for that is that\nwhen you're venting about a hardsituation that you're going through, or\nsomething that you're frustrated aboutwith yourself, typically the person\nyou've invited into the conversation,they're a nice, empathetic person.They want to make you feel better.And so what do they do?They offer emotional\nbalm in the situation.They're like, oh my God, that does\nsound terrible, you were so wronged.I'm so sorry you went through that,\ninstead of playing the role of whatEthan calls like, a cognitive advisor,\nwhich is actively trying to challengethe narrative you're telling about\nyour situation, actively trying toget you to question whether the way\nyou're portraying the situation isaccurate, and actively trying to get\nyou to reframe aspects of the situation.And so when we think about venting, when\nit comes to, again, filling in those blindspots about ourselves, you might want\nto tell your friend at the outset, like,you even said, lay off the nice stuff.I just want to hear the hard stuff you\nwant to tell your friend at the beginning.Look, I'm having this challenge with my\ncolleague at work, where this guy at thegym is giving me a really tough time.I don't know what's going on.Here's the situation.Rather than trying to make me feel\nbetter about the situation, I wantyou to actively find holes, poke holes\nin the way that I'm thinking aboutthis thing so that I can try and find\nsome reframing strategies to see thesituation from a different vantage point.So these are all called\ndistancing techniques.Third person versus first person.And actually, there's some really\ninteresting neuroscience researchshowing that when we view our\nproblems in ourselves from a thirdperson perspective, neural activity\nin areas associated with hostilityand aggression actually decrease.And so that can be really helpful\nwhen it comes to resolvinginterpersonal conflict or trying to\nsee where you might have been wrong.Andrew Huberman: I love these\nexamples because especially theone where one does it on their own,\nit truly doesn't require anything.Maya Shankar: You can be the\nintroverted Andrew and still do this.You don't even have to go to the\nparty and then ghost everyone.Andrew Huberman: Yeah, well,\nback then, there were no cellphones or smartphones, rather.But, yeah, it was a bit of ghosting.I can reset with small numbers of people\nthat I'm close to, but I found at thattime a need to go into an isolated space\nto do what I need to do to reset myself.But I realized there are certain forms\nof communication that are still required.Like, I'm alive.I still get this from my\nmother every once in a while.She's like, if you don't reach out, not\nonly do I not know what's happening withyou, but I also don't know if you're okay.And I'm thinking, I'm a grown man.Of course I'm fine.And then I, of course, use the worst\npossible response that any son orchild could give, which is, listen,\nif something happened to me, someonelike the police would contact you--Maya Shankar: They'll let you know.[LAUGHS]Andrew Huberman: --or the hospital would\ncontact you, which is not reassuring.So, kids everywhere, call your parents.Maya Shankar: I know.J ust call your poor mother Andrew.Just call her a bit more, come on.[LAUGHS]Andrew Huberman: I know, I know.Well, still working on it.It is a work in progress.Venting.I'm so glad that you brought this up.I think that there are these buzzwords\nnow, authenticity, I do think that thereare certain forms of communication that\ncan be injurious to people, and yet Ithink having some internal buffers to\nall that incoming stuff is important.I mean, you can't be online, and\nI think everyone is pretty muchonline these days, without having\nsome policies for oneself and howyou're going to deal with this stuff.How am I going to be a selective filter?I think knowing the ends of the continuum\nlike, this is clearly benevolent,kind, discourse, this is clearly bad.I'm going to block this or get rid of\nit, but then within that middle range,having some rules and policies for how\nto filter it, either by time of daythat you look at it or getting input.But considering it might be true, it\nmight not be true what people are saying.Maya Shankar: And like you said, you\nwere talking about memory and how wetend to over weight negative experiences.And I did find myself like, so I gave\nthis speech and it was posted, andI was looking at the comments, and\nanytime I brain coded a comment aspositive, I just skipped right past it.I was literally just searching\nfor the n egative stuff.Andrew Huberman: As if the\npositive is generic and thenegative is somehow genuine.Maya Shankar: Yes.And I had to make it mental,\nI had to make a mental note.Hey, it's okay to marinate in the\nmessages that are saying that thisreally helped them in some way\nand they really enjoyed the thing.Again, for self-critical people, I\nthink it takes an extra step to remindyourself to also read the good stuff\nand to allow that stuff to count, too.Andrew Huberman: Well, we did an\nepisode on gratitude, and one ofthe big surprises that came to me in\nresearching for that episode was thatthe best evidence for gratitude having\npositive effects on neural circuitry,neurochemistry comes from when we receive\ngratitude as opposed to giving gratitude.This is what's often lost in\nthe discussion about gratitude.So all the more incentive to give\ngratitude and to be aware of when it'scoming your way and internalize it.There is a small category of people\nout there, I think, hopefully small,that so bask in positive feedback\nthat it amplifies their narcissism.But it's clear that you are\nnot one of those people.So zero minus one risk of that happenIng.I want to talk a little bit about goals\nas it relates to motivation, becauseyou've done a lot of important work."

            "text": "And what I consider is organization\nof this, what would otherwisebe a pretty complex space.What is more important to most people\nthan being motivated and focused andexcited, hopefully on endeavors that\nthey enjoy and that inspire delight.But tell us about what can not\njust initiate, but what can sustainmotivation, because we've talked about\nthe dopamine system on this podcastmany times before, but that's a\npretty reductionist way to look at it.And you have a different perspective\nthat I've really benefitedfrom learning a bit about.Maya Shankar: Yeah.So when it comes to goals, I mean,\nit's first important to recognizethat there's two parts of a goal.So there's the way that we define\nthe goal, and then there's theway that we pursue the goal.And I think we tend to overlook the\nfirst category, how we define the goal,because oftentimes our goals seem like\nthey should be so obvious to us, right?I want to lose weight.I want to avoid sleeping late so\nthat I get a good night's sleep.I want to build muscle mass.Right?Like these are things that just seem like\nthey should just be intuitive, right?But what research and behavioral\nscience shows is that not allgoal frames are made equal.In fact, really small tweaks to the\nway that we frame our goals can havean outsized impact on whether or not\nwe're successful at reaching that goal.So one such framing is whether you\nframe your goals in terms of an approachorientation or an avoidance orientation.Let me talk about what this means.So an approach orientation would\nbe I want to eat healthier foods.Avoidance would be I want\nto avoid unhealthy foods.So in the context of, say, your\nsocial life approach would be,I want to be in a relationship,\nI want to enter a relationship.Avoidance would be, I want\nto avoid feeling loneliness.I want to avoid feeling isolated.Now the reason why these two frames\nare important to consider is thatthey can have a different impact on\nour motivational states, and they canalso have a different impact on the\nemotional response that we have tosuccess and failure in these domains.So what we tend to find is that when you\nframe something in an approach orientationway, when you succeed, that success is met\nwith feelings of pride and accomplishment.We find that it leads to a\nboost in motivation, it boostsendurance, it boosts perseverance.When you frame something in terms\nof avoidance, success is metwith feelings of calm and relief.So kind of like a wipe the forehead.Like, thank goodness I avoided\nthat calamitous outcome.Or thank goodness I avoided\ndoing that really bad thing.Andrew Huberman: Back to neutral?Maya Shankar: Yeah, exactly.And so it is fine to frame\ngoals in terms of avoidance.And actually, sometimes it's\njust personality dependent.Like some people are more\ndriven by fear or they need alot more urgency to drive them.But it is important to know that\nthe approach orientation is,on average, more motivating.And so you might want to think\nof reframing your goal in termsof approach versus avoidant.The other advantage to approach is that\nwhen you frame something as avoidant.I want to avoid doing X,\nI want to avoid doing Y.It's really hard to measure success.It's like, are you really tracking every\ntime you're tempted by the chocolate chipcookie and you don't actually eat it?That's really hard to measure.And we do better when we can\nmeasure success and failure.It's much easier to track the number\nof times you approach a salad.You approach something that's healthy.And so, anyway, so it's really\ninteresting to see how, again, thisreally subtle shift, and we see this\nacross the board in behavioral science,can have such a big impact on behavior.And on this framing thing, I'll\njust share one little anecdotefrom my time working in government.So we were trying to motivate veterans\nto sign up for an employment andeducational assistance program, so\nthis is after their years of service.And this is a really important\nbenefit that the government offersfor free, because the transition\nfrom military to civilian lifecan be very fraught with a lot of\npsychological and physical obstacles.And so I remember the Department of\nVeterans Affairs, they had almost no moneyto fund a marketing program around this.They said, Maya and team, we've\ngot one email that we're goingto send to vets and have at it.But that's all we're working with.And my teammates and I ended up changing\njust one word in this email message.Instead of telling vets that they were\neligible for the program, we simplyreminded them that they had earned\nit through their years of service.And that one word change led to a 9%\nincrease in access to the benefit.And it's based on a psychological\nprinciple called the endowmenteffect, which says that we value\nthings more when we own them orin this case, have earned them.And so I shared this example only to say,\nlike, that is such a small change, right?But we just know that, again, these\nsmall little tweaks in the waythat we talk to ourselves, the way\nthat we frame our goals, can have areally big impact on our behavior.Andrew Huberman: I'm\nfascinated by that result.Some people hearing it might think,\nokay, 9%, is that really that great?But we're talking about a one word change.Maya Shankar: And the scale\nof the federal government.[LAUGHS]Andrew Huberman: Right.Big organizations.Hard to argue that things change\nquickly in big organizations.Discussion for another time.But eligible versus earned.I mean, again, I come back to this\npossibility that there's something aboutwords like \"earned\" that invoke a verb\nstate within us that makes us more actionoriented, similar to being able to see\nourselves in some landscape that can evokedelight or awe, as opposed to just seeing\nthe landscape that evokes delight or awe.Yeah, I'm really hung up on this because\nI think one of the major challenges, itseems, for behavioral change is that most\npeople do wait for the stick, as opposedto feeling into the carrot, so to speak.I mean, all you have to do is look at\nthe enormous number of people who arestruggling with health related issues for\nwhich there's now a lot of active debate.Is it genetically determined?And setting all that aside, it's just\nvery clear that there are a number ofbehavioral things, sunlight, sleep,\nexercise, social connection, nutritionamong them, that there's no pill\nfor, there's no injection for, thereis absolutely no replacement for.So getting people to change\ntheir behavior is hard.Telling people that they're\ncapable sometimes helps,but doesn't seem sufficient.So what are some more of these verb\nstates that people you think caninternalize that give them access\nto the real sense of possibility and"

            "text": "get them changing their behavior?Maya Shankar: Yeah, and\nbehavior change is very hard.I sometimes bristle at some of the hacks\nthat I see online because I'm like, Idon't think there's a lot of evidence\nthat supports that this works, so, youknow, what I'm sharing today is actually\nbacked by really high quality research.One of my friends and mentors, Ayelet\nFishbach, has done a lot of thiswork at the University of Chicago\non goal setting and motivation.A couple other things for people\nto consider, and by the way, I lovethis space because I'm obsessed with\ngoals, so I love getting better atthings, and I'm using all of these\ninsights in my own life, so it istruly a delight to get to share them.Okay, sidebar.Andrew Huberman: Important\nsidebar, I would argue, becauseyou live this stuff, right?You don't just research it, you live it.Maya Shankar: Yeah, it's totally\nme-search or whatever they call it.So who sets the goal matters.So a lot of us work with coaches,\ntrainers, mentors, bosses.That's great.It's really, really helpful for people\nin our lives to bring structure to ourgoals, to push us along, to motivate us.But when other people are setting\nour goals, setting our targetsfor us, it undermines a really\nvaluable source of motivation,which is being in the driver's seat.We love steering our lives.We love feeling agency.We love recruiting our own agency\nwhen it comes to achieving our goals.We talked about how people\nwill go to irrational lengthsto avoid feeling uncertainty.People will also go to irrational\nlengths to preserve their agencyand control over a situation.So there's some really interesting\nresearch that's come out just in thelast few years showing that humans\nprefer to use their judgment overan algorithm that they know performs\nbetter than their judgment, but didnot involve them, and they're much\nmore satisfied with the outcomes whenit's them that's in the driver's seat.And so what this means, I think, in\neveryday context, is not to do away with,like, trainers and coaches and whatnot.Every trainer and coach who's\nlistening, don't hate me.Okay?You're sticking around.But what they can do is they can\nbuild something of a choice setinto your day to day programming.So let's say that at work you have a\ncertain skill that you're trying to build.Ask for a set of options to choose from.Own the targets more, you will\nsee a boost in motivation.Let's say you're working\nout with a trainer.They're like, it's leg day, okay, I'm\ngoing to own some of my targets, right?Are we going to go\nheavy hard on deadlifts?Are we going to go hard on squats?Whatever it is.And so build some agency into the\nexperience, because nothing supplants thatkind of intrinsic drive and the feeling\nthat you own the success or the failure.Again, I think to your earlier point, what\nwe're really trying to do with some ofthese behavioral insights is capitalize\non our natural state as humans, right?Like, what drives us.And it turns out we really\nlove being in control.Well, why don't we monopolize on that\nwhen it comes to our goal pursuit, right?So we're trying to figure out those\nareas of psychology that we can leverage.Andrew Huberman: That's fantastic.The word agency is so key here, I think.And it explains that earlier\nresult, the shock experiment.People having agency over their\nresponse to 100% of the time, atleast it's giving them some sense\nof control and mitigating it.Whereas when it's random, 50/50,\nrather, when it's random, 50% of thetrials, then even though the outcome\nis better on the whole, it's perceivedsomehow as a reduction in agency.There's something\nfundamental there, for sure.When I started my laboratory and there\nwas an additional pressure to publishpapers, this was before getting tenure,\nI used to ask students in postdocs whenthe paper would be ready, and then finally\nI stopped asking and just said, whydon't you tell me when the deadline is?And not a single one failed.Or rather, I should put it in the positive\nlight every single time they succeededin beating their estimate because\nthey were in control of that endpoint.Maya Shankar: Love that.Andrew Huberman: So it was at times\nchallenging for me, but they set a date.And also, by the way, if they need\nto extend that date outward, we did.That was their choice.They said they needed more time.The rule in science that I think applies\na lot of places is, I always like thephrase as fast as I carefully can.Because you don't want to rush.Maya Shankar: Absolutely.Andrew Huberman: But that sense\nof agency, I like to think,translated to more joy for them.Certainly there was a lot of\nproductivity from them, andthey might be listening to this.And so they can put in the comments\nwhether or not I'm telling the truth here.Maya Shankar: [LAUGHS]Andrew Huberman: Most of\nthem are professors now.Maya Shankar: Well, that\nprobably means they succeeded.Andrew Huberman: They\ndefinitely succeeded.The question is whether or not\nI had anything to do with it.My advisors always said the best\nthing you could do is supportyour students in postdocs and\nthen just get out of their way.Because the really good\nones, you can't control them.You're just trying to not\nscrew things up for them.Maya Shankar: Yeah, yeah, yeah.There's a lot of intrinsic\nmotivation there.Andrew Huberman: I'm curious about\nthe difference between lone pursuits"

            "text": "and group pursuits, because I know you\nunderstand a lot about groups, and Iwant to make sure that we talk about\ngroupthink, although that has such anegative connotation, but the way that\nwe tend to kind of revert to the meanwhen it comes to our thinking and our\nopinions and certainly our explanationsof who's right and who's wrong when we\nare in a collection of like-minded people.This could also be phrased\nas, what are the dangers ofbeing among like-minded people?And then we'll relate\nthat back to motivation.But what are the dangers of\nbeing among like-minded people?Maya Shankar: Yeah, well, in the\ncontext of goals and motivation, itcan be very, very helpful to be in\nthe context of like-minded people.And the reason for that is we often\ndon't see failure up close when it comesto people pursuing their goals, but if\nwe are in the presence of people whosevalues we share, who have a similar\ncommitment to doing something, and wesee up close that they sometimes have\nthose days where they fail, or we havethe vulnerability to show when we've\nfailed, that can actually increaseour resolve that the goals that we're\ntrying to achieve are actually possible.I think the danger of being in the\nlike-minded spaces is around how itlimits your frame of mind, s o when it\ncomes to the ideas that you have, whenit comes to the convictions you have\naround your points of view, it can be verydangerous to only be in the echo chamber\nagain, because I want to give peoplestrategies to challenge their way of\nthinking without them having to socialize.For all the introverts out there,\nI have a lot of compassion.I have introverted tendencies.So I get it.One helpful thought experiment you can use\nwhen you feel like maybe you're spending alittle bit too much time around people who\nare just reinforcing whatever viewpointsyou have, is to ask how your belief system\nand your ideas and your opinions of thingsmight have been different had you been\nborn during a different time period and ina different family or cultural landscape,\nand what happens when it comes to ourviewpoints is that they become so tethered\nto our identities that we feel like ifwe were to jettison a certain belief or\nvalue, we would be jettisoning ourselves,and that feels way too threatening.It's way too destabilizing\nto engage in that.But the minute you imagine what it\nwould have been like to have beenborn in a different family, with a\ndifferent religious belief system, witha different value system, all of a sudden\nyou transport your same self, right?I'm still Maya, into this new environment,\nand you start to see how non-precioussome of your beliefs are, right?Maybe they don't have the sacred\nquality that you thought that they did.And so you might be more open to changing\nyour mind, more open and receptive tochallenging your own points of view if\nyou engage in that thought experiment.Andrew Huberman: I recall you discussing\na description of people watching agame of sport that involved bad calls.Maya Shankar: Yeah.Controversial referee calls.Andrew Huberman:\nControversial referee calls.Yeah.If you could share with us a little bit\nabout that result, because I find itreally interesting, especially the part\nwhere the experimenters can swap theidentities of the teams in theory, and\nthen, well, basically what people cometo realize is that our perception of\nthe outside world is strongly informedby the group that we see ourselves\nin, and often to our own detriment.Maya Shankar: Absolutely.Yeah.So this is a study from the 1950s.And to your point, we tend to\nthink, okay, we're human beings.We're really enlightened, we're\nmaking decisions, and we're engagingin judgments of things based\non data and evidence and facts.And surely my visual\nsystem wouldn't lie to me.So whatever I perceive is going to be\ntrue and a veridical representationof the world and, like, not true.Okay, a lot of our beliefs,\nand these are strong beliefs.I mean, again, they're what we\nbelieve to be fact about the worldis informed by our group membership.So in this study, loyal fans of\ntwo opposing football teams watchedthese controversial plays, so,\nwhere the referee made a call, andthey weren't quite certain if it\nwas like, in or out, let's say.And depending on your loyalty to the\nteam, to whatever sports team, whicheverside you were on, you were much more\nlikely to favor calls that were madeon your teams in your team's favor.And when you ask people coming out of a\nstudy like this, it's not like, yes, Iknew I was biased, like, I knew that I was\nbasing my judgment of these referee callsbased on my affiliation and my love of\nTeam X or Team Y, you wouldn't think that.You'd think you were an arbiter\nof truth in this situation.You're just recalling what\nyour visual system saw.And I think that shows how powerful\nthese social forces are, how powerful ourgroup affiliations are, because it can\ntruly change the way that you see stuff.Of course, it can then transform\nthe way that you think about stuff.And so that, to me, is a powerful reminder\nthat when we are in disagreement withsomeone else and we just try to bombard\nthem with facts, I mean, you're ascientist, so if you're hearing someone\nsay something and you're like, oh,that's not accurate, that's not true.Your instinct probably says, but have\nyou heard about the 2017 study, the peerreviewed journal article from PubMed?But when you recognize that, actually\na large part of our belief systememerges from the groups that we\nidentify with, I think there's aninspiring lesson that comes from this.So we shouldn't be too disheartened by\nthe fact that this is true, but it helpsround out our understanding of why it is\nthat people believe the things they do.And as a result, we have more\nresources at hand to try to understandhow we can change their minds.So, one of the guys that I interviewed\non my podcast, his name is Daryl Davis.He's a black jazz musician, and he was\nconfronted by a member of the Ku Klux Klanat one of his performances, and it led,\ntalk about a slight change of plans , Imean, he just went on a totally different\nlife path and ended up convincing dozensof people to leave white supremacy\ngroups, including the Ku Klux Klan.And when it comes to Daryl and his\napproach, well, one, he recruited people'sagencies, so he never implied to them,\noh, I'm trying to change your mind.He always says, like, I\ndidn't convince them, Maya.They convinced themselves\nto change their mind.So he recruited their agency.But he also tried his absolute\nhardest to not question theirfundamental and underlying humanity.So he tried to understand, why\nare you part of this group,this vile vitriolic group?And some people would share, well, you\nknow, it's a family tradition thing.My father was in the klan.My grandfather's in the klan.Look, none of this excuses\nbeing in a hate group, okay?But at least it gave Daryl an\nunderstanding of some of the factorsthat were pushing them towards\nthe group so that he might offerthat sense of community, that\nsense of belonging somewhere else,maybe outside of a hate group.But if he thought that he was actually\njust fighting over facts, over whetherAfrican Americans should be treated equal\nto everyone else, then he would havelost that argument, because he wasn't\neven fighting with the right currency.What was relevant?It was the first episode of A Slight\nChange of Plans we ever releasedand continues to be my favorite.Because what was so thrilling about\nthis interview is that the strategiesDaryl used to convince people to\nchange their minds again of thesedeeply entrenched, horrific views were\ntotally corroborated by the scienceof how we change people's minds.So he used a lot of really effective\nstrategies, just intuitively, like,he's just a mastermind behavioral\nscientist just by virtue of who he is.But he showed genuine curiosity for\nwhy it is they believed what theydid, which is, again, extremely hard.And I would not have had the equanimity\nto show genuine curiosity for whysomeone is in the Ku Klux Klan.But he showed that curiosity.He increased his question\nto statement ratio.So it's really important to ask\npeople a lot of questions, and thenhe would ask people a really important\nquestion, which is, well, what,in theory, could change your mind?Like, what evidence would I have\nto give you in order to changeyour mind about X, Y, or Z?And the reason that I love asking that\nquestion is that it presupposes thatsomeone ought to be willing to change\ntheir mind in the face of new information.So this harkens back to the conversation\nwe were having earlier about theimportance of having

            "text": "that where I see failures en masse of\npublic health policy or educationalpolicy, almost always there seems to be a\nfailure of even interest in understandingwhat motivates the other side's position.And this actually gets me frustrated\nto the point of being motivated,where it's like people are saying,\nyou're wrong, you're wrong.Know this, know that to the\npoint of it's almost maddening.And far more seldom do we see people\nsaying, okay, I'm in a third personmyself, or I'm going to put myself\nin the other person's shoes andsay, why might they feel that way?Why would this person be listening\nto this individual as opposed tothis public health individual?And look, without taking any stance\non this, because it's a much biggerconversation than we want to have\nright now, I could look at publichealth officials that just completely\nfailed to understand the otherside's position and vice versa.And that to me just says\nit's a communication failure.And I'll take this out of the COVID\npandemic discussion as it's normallyhad and say that one thing that we know\nfor sure is that in the 2020 to really2022, but still 2023 landscape, there\nwere so many mental health concerns.Everybody, regardless of where\npeople were on the vaccinedebate, mass debate, lockdown\ndebate, regardless of any of that,everyone's stress level was elevated.Maya Shankar: Absolutely.Andrew Huberman: And there were very,\nvery few top down from, at the levelof government, discussions about\nhow to maintain circadian rhythmand sleep health, how to maintain\nhealth in general in that landscape.And that, for me, was\njust really shocking.It was also one of the reasons why\nwe launched the podcast, frankly,is that I really feel that the\ntools were needed by everybody andshould be zero cost to everybody.But what was clear is there was so much\npointing of fingers and name calling andviolence even, that no one was saying,\nlike, why would people feel this way?Why would people trust these\nsources as opposed to these sources?And we can only conclude if\nwe're good scientists that thelandscape was ineffective, right?It was just ineffective.And it continues.I mean, if you have the desire to take\na reduction in dopamine by going onTwitter and following this back and forth\nthat continues today, it's pretty ugly.Still, none of it seems\nreally solution oriented.There are a few people out\nthere who are trying to make itsolution oriented, but not really.And so I don't want to go\ninto the dark aspects here.But it does seem like this\nwillingness to take a look at whyothers might feel the opposite of\nhow we feel is a very rare quality.And this gentleman, Daryl,\nwhat was his last name?Maya Shankar: Daryl Davis.Andrew Huberman: I think I've\nseen a number of things with him.He's obviously extraordinary, but\nwe call him that because peoplelike him are exceedingly rare.So what can we do to cultivate\nthat kind of mindset?Because I'm not pointing fingers\nhere, I mean, I think we all have thisdefault tendency to gather evidence\nthe way that we gather evidence, drawconclusions, and then stand our ground.And I think it's detrimental to everyone.Maya Shankar: So you're making me\nreflect on probably the greatestgift that being a cognitive\nscientist has given me in my life.Obviously, it's fed my curiosity, it's\nbeen a delight to study things andlearn things, but the greatest gift it\nhas given me is empathy towards people.It is the greatest driver of human\nempathy to learn how our minds work.And I don't know if there's\na substitute for that.Partly that's why I started A Slight\nChange of Plans . We have story episodeswhere you hear from people like Daryl,\nbut I interview scientists from all overthe world about their areas of expertise.And I genuinely believe that the more\nwe learn about how the mind works,the more we learn from my field of\ncognitive science about how we makedecisions, how we develop our attitudes\nand beliefs about the world, how wecome to be the people that we are, the\nmore we can bridge these empathy gaps.And it's been profound for me.I mean, I feel so lucky to\nhave been steeped in thisliterature for decades now.But my hope is to invite people into\nthe conversation, because the more youlearn about why people are the way they\nare, the more empathy you can extend.And the more, I'm not even saying you\nneed to extend an olive branch, I'mnot saying that you need to compromise\nyour own belief system, but at leastyou see that there might be an entry\npoint, a reason to have a discussionwith this person who believes things\nthat are completely different from you.And we talked about gratitude a bit.In this conversation, I feel immense\ngratitude that I have a posture ofempathy as I move around in this world,\nbecause I have strong beliefs on things.I care a lot.I care about reducing human suffering.And then I meet someone who I think is pro\na policy that promotes human suffering.And of course, the visceral human\ninstinct is like, to hell withyou and your viewpoint, this is\nhorrible, this is intolerable.But because I have this\ncognitive science hat on.It allows me to walk around with\na slightly different viewpoint,and I really feel that I'm a\nbetter person as a result of that.And I've heard from listeners of A Slight\nChange of Plans when they listen to thesescience episodes, whether it's the science\nof loneliness, the science of empathy,the science of meditation, I try to bring\nthis empathetic spin to understanding,again, neuroscience and psychology, they\nhave found that they are kinder to others.And so that's probably the best\nfeedback that I've ever received onthe show, is like, people are like,\nI'm a nicer person to other people now,especially the ones I don't agree with.Andrew Huberman: And presumably\nto themselves as well.I know you've brought up the\ntopic of empathy as a wayto prevent burnout, right?And here we're not just\ntalking about job burnout.We're talking about the burnout\nthat is inherent to any longterm pursuit that's challenging,\nraising kids, being in a family.What is the great Ram Das quote?Think you're enlightened?Go spend a week with your parents,\nno matter how enlightened you are.I remind myself that I love my parents.I love my parents, but it's just a\ncompletely different frame shift.But also kind to oneself.I mean, I think there's starting\nto be some good neuroscience atthe mechanistic level of empathy.Clearly, empathy is not the\ndefault state for most people.It's something that we need to cultivate\nas a practice and that we can cultivateas a practice along the lines of empathy."

            "text": "But also returning to a topic that\nwe opened today's discussion with.We build these narratives about ourselves\nstarting in adolescence, maybe evenearlier and through our teen years,\nand we have various experiences.But I'm curious how we can continue to\nbuild narratives about ourselves and therole of narrative, the I statements, the I\nam statements, and whether or not you andwe should all spend some time doing this.I mean, these days people exercise\nbecause we know it's good for us.I hope people get sunlight because they\nknow it's great for them that peopleperhaps have a meditation practice or a\ntherapy practice or a journaling practice.But how is it that we can continue to\nevolve our narratives about self in a waythat promotes some or all of the things\nthat we've been talking about today?Maya Shankar: Yeah.So empathy is really interesting because\nI think we have a lot of misconceptionsabout it, and we have misconceptions\nabout how empathetic we actually are.I would argue people are more empathetic\nthan they think, and let me tell you why.So, this comes from research by\nmy friend Jamil Zaki at Stanford.There're three distinct types of empathy\na lot of people don't know about.So the first kind is emotional\nempathy, and this is the one thatfeels very intuitive to most of us.So it's this visceral reaction I have.You tell me that you've\nhad a really hard time.My eyes start to well up.I can truly feel your pain, and\nI just feel what you feel, okay?And that typically, is what people think\nof when they think of empathy, period.They overlook two other types of empathy.The second type is\ncalled cognitive empathy.This is the ability to accurately\ndiagnose what it is that's causing youdistress in this moment, and what it is\nthat I could offer up to you to try tohelp ameliorate some of your suffering.The third kind is called empathic\nconcern, or it's known as compassionas well, which is the actual desire to\nhelp, you desire to help another person.And what's so interesting about\nthese three types of empathy is thatthey don't correlate within people.You can be really high on the\nemotional empathy scale, right?You can have tears streaming down\nyour face as you hear about yourfriend's divorce, but you might be\nreally bad at diagnosing what itis that's causing them distress.You might be really bad at actually\noffering up a solution to their problem.Or you might lack the will.Like, if you're sociopathic, you might\njust not have the will to help someone.And what's so interesting is that, I\nthink in our society, this relates back toidentity and the labels we give ourselves.I think our society puts a huge premium\non emotional empathy, and we discountpeople who don't have that visceral\nresponse, and we just immediatelysay, oh, they're not empathetic.And this happens from the time that\nwe're really little, by the way, likethe kid who's crying on the playground,\ncomforting their friend, right?They're like, wow, that\nkid's got a ton of empathy.My older kid doesn't seem to\nreally care about people, but theymight excel in cognitive empathy.They might excel when it\ncomes to empathic concern.So one of the things I was talking\nabout with Jamil on A Slight Changeof Plans , you know, maybe we ought to\nthink about empathy languages in thesame way we think about love languages.People have different ways of\nexpressing their empathy, andwe ought to value them equally.And that's been wonderful, because I\nthink even in the past, I would havehad a really hard situation, and I go\nto one of my friends, and they justseem like, a little bit more stoic.And I'm like, do you even give a shit?Why do you not care as\nmuch as I want you to care?It turns out they're fantastic\nat wanting to help me andunderstanding what's wrong with me.And I love the idea of giving a little\nmore love to those second two buckets,because I think it'll allow us to better\nrecruit more empathy from others andalso to see ourselves differently,\nmaybe for those people out there who arelike, I'm not a very empathetic person.You might actually be more\nempathetic than you think.The second thing I wanted\nto share is about burnout.So you talked a little bit about burnout.People who rate really high on the\nemotional empathy scale tend toexperience burnout at higher rates.So you can imagine healthcare workers,\nfirst responders, essentially whatyou're doing when you feel emotional\nempathy is you're carrying theburden of the other person's pain.So you can easily imagine\nhow that can deplete you.And I think the instinct that we have when\nwe're empathetic is to say, you know what?I'm just going to shut myself off.I had that experience in 2020.I was like, there's too much\nbad stuff happening around me.Like, I prefer to just not feel things.Thank you very much.And so I tried to close myself\noff from natural emotionalreactions I would have to things.But what Jamil's research shows is\nthat you don't actually have to.If you cultivate cognitive empathy\nand empathic concern, those canactually be protective against burnout.So you don't have to do away\nwith empathy altogether.You just have to shift gears and\nbe more selective about the kind ofempathy that you're investing in.So I love this research because, again,\nit just opens your mind up to thiswhole world of empathy that you might\nhave thought of as more as, like,the singular concept and allows there\nto be a little bit more grace space.Andrew Huberman: I love the idea that\nthere are different categories of empathy.It will also arm me with a response,\nif ever, hypothetically, someonesays, I don't feel like you're\nreally feeling what I'm feeling,and therefore you're not empathic.To my experience, where I rate\non these scales isn't important.But this notion of cognitive empathy, I\nthink, is really important and probablyone that most people haven't heard of.I certainly haven't heard of it,\nbut I like to think that it reallydoes exist and that it's at least--Maya Shankar: --And you\nmight have it in spades.Andrew Huberman: I don't know.You'd have to ask the people close to me.But that it is at least as important as\nthe emotional empathy before we concludethere is something that I unfortunately\npushed us past too quickly that I want to"

            "text": "return to because I think it's something\nthat so many people care about and livewith each day, which is this issue of\nchallenges with ongoing motivation.And forgive me for doing a\nbit of an anachronism here.I'm sort of jumping back to this\nbecause I realized that I pulled usoff to another topic, but you've talked\nabout the middle problem before andit's too important to not return to.So tell us about the middle problem and\nhow we can overcome the middle problem.Maya Shankar: And before I do that,\ndo you mind if I give just a coupleshort strategies around goal setting?I just want to make sure\nI round out that section.Andrew Huberman: Not only would\nI not mind, I would be delighted.Maya Shankar: I just want to make\nsure, again, I share the wisdom that'shelped me so much in my personal life.Okay, I'll try to be fast.Andrew Huberman: Please take your time.Maya Shankar: But people have these goals\nto reach, I got to get them out running.So the first is to make sure that you\nare, so we've already talked aboutapproach versus avoidant goals, right?We've talked about how who sets the goal\nmatters and how if it's you, it's better.If you have some ownership\nover your targets.The third thing is to make sure that\nyou're setting goals when you're in thesame psychological and physiological\nstate as the one you'll be in whenyou're actually pursuing the goal.Because we tend to have what is known\nas this is, again, fishbox work.We tend to have empathy gaps between our\npresent day selves and our future selves.And that empathy gap can lead us to be\nvery compassionate towards 4:00 p.m.on Sunday watching TV Maya, and 6:00 a.m.Maya, who I hope is going to be at the\ngym, like killing herself with a reallyhigh intensity interval set or whatnot.And so if it is 4:00 p.m.on Sunday, probably not the best\ntime for you to say, I'm going togo to the gym every day at 6:00 a.m.If you actually are at the gym at 6:00\na.m., and you are feeling viscerally thephysiological pain, the psychological\npain of having gotten up reallyearly to do the workout, then it's\nreasonable for you to set that goal.But it's kind of the opposite\nof, like they say, don't goto the supermarket hungry.Actually, in this situation, you want\nto be in exactly the same physiologicaland psychological state you'll be\nin when you're in goal pursuit.It'll make it much more likely\nthat you set reasonable goalsand you actually reach them.The second thing that you might\nwant to think about is, so I don'tknow about you, Andrew, but I feel\nlike I'm a goal purist by nature.So when I set a goal, the minute I,\nlike, fall off even slightly, the goal isgone for me, and I'm like, I messed up.Let's start from the beginning.Let's start from scratch.I need a new goal.I've already messed up,\nand it doesn't matter.So I feel like unless I achieve\nperfection in achieving my goals,I get very frustrated and I just\nfall off the wagon completely.So one thing that researchers have\nshown is that it's really helpful tobuild in what's called an emergency\nreserve into your goal setting, orslack is another way of putting it.So let's say I have a goal.I want to go to the gym\nevery single day this month.It's really important and helpful\nto give yourself, and you'renot going soft on yourself.I promise to give yourself, for\nexample, three get out of jailfree cards, three days where, for\nwhatever reason, it's okay that youdidn't go to the gym, you got sick.Maybe you have kids who got sick.You're just not feeling motivated.It doesn't really matter\nwhat the reason is.You didn't go to the gym.But the important thing is that you're\nstill on track to achieving your goal,even if you missed those three days\nbecause you built them into the system.The final thing I'll say about\nsetting the goal is to tryto capitalize on a phenomenon\nknown as the fresh start effect.So this is work by my friend Katy Milkman.She's a professor at Wharton at\nthe University of Pennsylvania.So what she's found is that in our\nlives, we have these big milestonemoments where we break from the past\nand we're entering a new future.This might be moving across the country.It could be getting a new job.It could be getting married.It could be whatever, okay?But one, it feels like a big change,\nand that's a wonderful moment to tryto introduce a new set of patterns\ninto your life, in part becauseagain, you have a break in identity.But two, it's really easy to introduce\nnew habits when a lot of yourenvironmental circumstances are different.So I take a new job.All of a sudden, I have\na new route to work.Probably a good idea to not introduce\na pastry stop every time I go towork, because I no longer am passing\nby that bakery every morning.So you want to capitalize on\nfresh starts of that kind.There's also more arbitrary fresh starts\nthat exist for all of us, and this is inthe form of the first day of the year.So, of course, New Year's resolutions,\nthe first day of spring, even the firstday of the week, can be very motivating\nbecause we all like clean slates.We like wiping away the past.We like embarking on a new\nfuture that's clean of failureand stumbling and whatnot.And so that can be a\nreally powerful motivator.Andrew Huberman: I love these\nsuggestions because I do thinkthat we like a clean start.There's something to that.Who knows why?But I think it's a universal trait.And perhaps shortening the time domain\nover which we think about our goalsand success and failure could help.Like if you just say the clean\nstart is this afternoon, becausethis morning didn't go so well.Maya Shankar: Yeah, y ou don't have to\nsurrender the whole week just becauseyou messed up on a Monday morning.Andrew Huberman: That's right.Maya Shankar: Yeah.Andrew Huberman: I'm sensing\nthe perfectionist in you.And I know that it's a continuum.Some people don't, I don't want to say\nsuffer from perfectionism, because Ithink it's a great attribute in certain\ndomains and can be challenging in others.But I love the idea of having a\nlittle bit of grace with one's goals.And also what you said earlier of making\nthe carrot compelling and not so muchfocusing on just the stick, making the\ncarrot more compelling, so much there.What about the middle problem?"

            "text": "Yeah, because I do think that people\ndo tend to go hard out the gate, asit were, and then people drop off.Maya Shankar: Yeah.So, yeah, all the stuff we talked about\nso far has been around defining the goal.And now we need to think about how we\nsustain our motivation to pursue the goal.And this can be super hard.Again, behavior change is\nincredibly hard to sustain.So the middle problem.So the middle problem refers\nto the fact that we don't havestable amounts of motivation\nover the course of goal pursuit.We tend to have a boost in motivation\nat the beginning of the pursuit.We all feel this viscerally, right?I've decided I'm going to do intermittent\nfasting or I'm going to make sure Ilook at the sun every morning, the\nfirst moment that I get up, or whateverthe goal is on that first day, you\nare so motivated to get it done right.In fact, the first few days, the first\nfew weeks, and then you experience aboost in motivation, a higher amount of\nmotivation towards the end of the goal.So we experience at the end of a goal\nwhat's known as the goal gradient effect.So we tend to experience monotonic\nincreases in motivation thecloser we are to the finish line.So we might even see it in\nmarathon runners, right?They're like, okay, I only\nhave this remaining part to go.I can expend all my energy now to\ntry to get over the finish line.There's a lull, though, in motivation\nin the middle of goal pursuit, andthat's something that we want to\nget ahead of, we want to solve.For now, obviously, we\ncannot eliminate middles.Mathematically impossible\nto eliminate middles.So what do we do?Well, we do something that you already\nalluded to, which is actually weshorten the time duration of our goals.So rather than setting an annual\ngoal, right, let's say that it'sthe new year, you're inspired to\ntry to make 2023 the best year ever.But the problem with that is when you\nset an annual goal now, your middleis months long, so you're going to\nexperience that decrease in motivationfor a healthy chunk of the year, which\nis not ideal if you set a weekly goal.By contrast, all of a sudden, your\nmiddle is a lot shorter, right?All of a sudden you're dealing with\nlike a few days, maybe a day or two.And so you want to be mindful\nof the duration of the goal.Another thing that can help keep\nmotivation high is to do what my friendKaty Milkman calls temptation bundling.So this has, number one, been my\ngo to strategy for having doneevery unpleasant activity in my\nlife that I've had to do, okay?Folding laundry, doing the dishes.I actually really like working out\nlike you do, so I don't need as muchmotivation, but sometimes I still\nneed that for high intensity days.I do need the motivation to\ndo, like, the hard cardio.So to get on into working out in that way.So what is temptation bundling?You're pairing an unpleasant activity\nlike folding laundry, doing dishes,taking out the trash, with an immediately\nrewarding, enjoyable activity that canbe listening to your favorite podcasts,\nwhich are, of course, the HubermanLab, and A Slight Change of Plans.\n Obviously, it could be listening to\nyour favorite pop music, but the reallycritical piece of the temptation bundling\nis that you have to forgo the indulgenceof enjoying that rewarding activity\nin all other spaces of your life.So, for example, for me, I\nfeel like a good pop song.I have, like, 25 really good listens,\nand then it kind of becomes old hat.So just, like, the excitement\nof the song wears off a bit.So there have been times where I'll\nbe, like, cooking with my husband,and he's like, hey, why don't we\nplay, you love Casey Musgraves,why don't we play that album?And I'm like, no, that's an\nalbum I can only listen to whenI'm, like, lifting weights.Andrew Huberman: Maintain the potency.Maya Shankar: You have to\nmaintain the potency, right?You don't allow yourself to get the joy\nand edification of the Huberman Lab whenyou're not taking a walk and getting\nexposure to that morning sunlight.And it's such a simple strategy\nwhen you think about it.But I have found myself looking forward\nto really annoying tasks that I haveto get done because I know I'm going\nto get the enjoyment of somethingreally fun that accompanies it.Andrew Huberman: Fantastic.Is it important that the thing that\none enjoys be done simultaneously?So folding laundry while watching\nthe Netflix thing or listeningto a particular piece of music?Maya Shankar: Yeah, you want\nthem to coexist, because thenagain, you get that immediately.Most of the time, the things\nthat we lament doing have reallypositive long term outcomes.If I'm in the habit of keeping my house\nclean, there's long term benefits.If I'm in the habit of\nexercising or eating healthily,there's long term benefits.But I don't often feel\nthe rewards in real time.So what you're trying to do is\ngive yourself that rush of joy andexcitement that accompanies the\nimmediately rewarding activity sothat in your mind, even just, like\nneurally, the two things are coexisting.Andrew Huberman: I love it because\nit has such firm grounding in theneurobiology of reward and aversion\nand how to overcome aversion.There's deep neuroscience around this, but\nI've never heard it presented that way.So thank you for those incredibly clear\nand actionable tools for motivation,because so many people struggle with that.Maya Shankar: Yeah.Andrew Huberman: And I\nhear that all the time.Maya Shankar: And I think\nyou talked about aversion.And actually, this is really important."

            "text": "So when we think about returning to our\ngoals, which is often the hard thing.So you do it on a Monday, and you have\nthat same goal on a Tuesday, and thenon a Wednesday, and on Thursday, and by\nThursday, you're kind of like, oh, myGod, it was so hard the first few days.Do I really want to go back and\ndo the same workout on a Thursday?What's really helpful here to avoid some\nof that aversion is to be mindful of theway in which our minds process memories.So when we reflect back on how much we\nenjoyed or didn't enjoy an experience, wedon't give equal weight to every moment.Each moment doesn't get uniform weight.Instead, we tend to give more weight to\nwhat's called the peak of the experience.So the experience that was most\nemotionally intense, the part of theexperience that was the most emotionally\nintense, and the end of the experience.So this is work done by Nobel\nlaureate Daniel Kahneman andhis collaborator, Amos Tversky.So the peak end rule\nis what this is called.So you put a lot of weight on, again,\nthat really emotionally intensemoment of the experience and the end.Now, researchers have studied this in the\ncontext of lots of unpleasant activities.So in some studies, people are forced to\nsubmerge their hands in ice cold water,or they looked at colonoscopies, for\nexample, and how unpleasant those are.And what they found is that\nthis is so interesting.Okay, I'm nerding out a little bit because\nI just think that this field is so cool.Andrew Huberman: Nerding\nout isn't just tolerated.It is encouraged on this podcast,Maya Shankar: I'm having a\nmoment with cognitive science.But this is such cool\nresearch, because what theseresearchers did, it's so clever.If you elongate the unpleasant experience\nby a couple of minutes, let's say, so,the hands in freezing cold ice water or\nthe colonoscopy, but you make those lastfew minutes of the unpleasant experience\nslightly less unpleasant than the end ofthe experience would otherwise have been.Right, had you just ended the colonoscopy\nprocedure as planned, had you just takenthe hands right out of the ice bucket by,\nfor example, increasing the temperatureof the water by a degree, or use your\nimagination, whatever the equivalent.Andrew Huberman: How can\nyou make a colonoscopy less?Maya Shankar: [LAUGHS] There are\nmechanisms by which the pain can be less.Andrew Huberman: [LAUGHS]\nPhysicians everywhere know them,but we are oblivious to them.Maya Shankar: Anyway, you guys can\ndo the mental work of figuring outwhat the equivalent is on Google.What they find is that people look\nback on the experience more favorably.They have a more positive\nimpression of the experience.Now, again, this is what's so\nmiraculous about this finding.The overall duration of the unpleasant\nexperience has been extended.There are more minutes of\noverall suffering, right?But the last few minutes are less bad\nthan they would have been otherwise.And so people are, they view\nthe experience more favorably.In the case of the colonoscopies,\nthey were actually more likelyto return for follow up visits,\nfor their annual checkups.And so what does this mean in daily life?Well, what it can mean is, let's say you\nare literally killing yourself at the gym.You have the hardest workout\nthat you've ever had.Tack on a few minutes to the end of\nthe workout that are still unpleasant,so you're still coding them as being\npart of the unpleasant working outexperience, but are a little bit less\nintense and less painful than theworkout end would have been otherwise,\nyou might be more likely to returnand actually do the hard workout.Andrew Huberman: Can we also\nsay if somebody really enjoystheir training, that the opposite\nwould be effective as well?That perhaps if they really want to push\nit hard at the end, because that's thesensation that they particularly enjoy,\nthat that could serve, presumably, thememory systems and the reward systems\nof the brain such that they are morelikely to return to the workout again.Maya Shankar: Absolutely.You raise a fantastic point, which\nis when we talk about enjoyment inthese contexts, it is all subjective.So I actually kind of love the\nfeeling like, I'm going to die,because my heart is racing.So, I mean, for whatever reason, I'm\njust wired to love exercise, right.And I love a heart\nstrength training workout.And so for me, what enjoyment might\nlook like at the end is really intense.Right.That might be what brings me back.But in other domains, absolutely\nnot, like the colonoscopy situation.I do not want that to be\nan unpleasant experience.And so there are lots of other domains\nin life where if you just tack on afew of the few minutes onto something\nthat's really tedious or really hardor really painful, it can make you\nmore likely to commit to it later.But it's an excellent point.In all of these studies, you have to\nconsider who the person is and whattheir natural psychology is like.And for everyone listening, you\nwant to tailor these recommendationsto who you are as a person.Andrew Huberman: Well, there are\ncertain life demands that I findincredibly aversive, so I'm going\nto use this approach for those.I'm also going to use them in the\ncontext of things I really enjoy.Because if one has the opportunity, I\nbelieve, to further reinforce the thingsthat bring us joy, why wouldn't we?Maya Shankar: Absolutely.Andrew Huberman:\nFantastic recommendations.Listen, I could ask you 1,000\nmore questions, and my hopeis that you'll come back--Maya Shankar: --I'd love to--Andrew Huberman: --so that I can\nask you those 1,000+ more questions.I have to say, it is exceedingly rare\nthat I talk to somebody either onthe podcast or elsewhere, frankly, in\nmy life, that has such an incrediblywide breadth of knowledge and yet has\nso much depth of knowledge as well.It's clear that your many experiences\nthrough music and cognitive science,podcasting, and by the way, we're\ngoing to provide links to your podcastin the show note captions so that\npeople can hear more from you as theyshould, and also your work in policy.You've put yourself in a lot\nof different domains, and Ithink that itself is inspiring.And whether or not it's by way\nof curiosity, human connection,or both, presumably it's both\nand many other things as well.I know I speak on behalf\nof many, many people.I just say thank you so much for\ndoing the work that you do, forcontinuing along these pursuits.I'm excited to hear where it might\nevolve in the future still, andfrankly, just for being you, because\nit's clear that your enthusiasm,your curiosity, and your generosity\nwith useful information is immense.So thank you ever so much.Maya Shankar: Well, that's so gracious\nand kind of you to say, Andrew.And these conversations, like the one we\njust had, I mean, it's why I do the work.It's so much fun and so interesting, and\nyou've given me so much food for thought.It really was a conversation, not an\ninterview, and that's such a gift.And so I just feel gratitude that\nI can share my body of work andall the insights I've learned along\nthe way with your listeners, and Ireally hope it's helpful to them.Andrew Huberman: It certainly is, and\nit's been an honor to have you here.So let's do it again.Maya Shankar: Yes, let's do it

    "episode_summary": "In this episode, my guest is Maya Shankar, Ph.D., a cognitive scientist, former senior advisor to the White House and Chair of the White House Social and Behavioral Sciences Team. She is the creator and host of the podcast, A Slight Change of Plans. We discuss how our identities develop and change, how our beliefs and internal narratives shape our perception of self, and how to use structured introspection about our values to determine our goals. We discuss how to cope and grow through uncertain situations, especially those that force us to reexamine our roles and identity. Dr. Shankar shares her experience of redefining her identity after an early career-ending setback. She also explains numerous science-based strategies to effectively define goals, structure our goal pursuits and maintain consistent motivation. This episode provides a science-supported toolkit and roadmap to assess your identity and goals and positively transform in the face of change.\nFor the full show notes, visit hubermanlab.com.\nThank you to our sponsors\nAG1: https://drinkag1.com/huberman\nMaui Nui Venison: https://mauinuivenison.com/huberman\nEight Sleep: https://eightsleep.com/huberman\nInsideTracker: https://insidetracker.com/huberman\nSupplements from Momentous\nhttps://www.livemomentous.com/huberman"
