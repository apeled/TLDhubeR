            "text": "honored to be here well I've been payingattention to your content for a longtime and I find it to be incrediblyclear informative and for many peopleactionable so today I'd like to talkabout both fertility and of coursehormones but as we both know fertilityis not limited to a discussion abouthormones it actually relates to thingslike behaviors yes sex behaviors andother behaviors nutritionsupplementation so we'll get into all ofit but if we could just back updevelopmentally and talk a little bitabout female puberty because I thinkpretty much everything we'll talk abouttoday is related to what happens pubertyforward mostly in females but we willalso discuss male fertility and hormonesa bit and the question I have is isthere anything about a woman's timingor let's just say patterns of pubertyright how frequentthey menstrate early on what the timingof menstration is uh in terms of theirage Etc that provides hints or maybeeven facts or directives about herfuture fertility or how long herfertility might last this is a greatquestion and I think defining someterminology before we begin is helpfulso if we go all the way back to whenyou're a fetus inside your mom so whenthere's a female fetus inside your momyou have the most eggs you're ever goingto have at about 20 weeks gestation youhave about 6 to 7 million eggs by thetime you're born you've already lostmore than half of those and youcontinually lose eggs all the time sothe analogy that I always use and you dotoo is imagining that there's a vaultinside the ovary where all your eggs arekept and every single month since themoment you have an ovary you lose agroup of these eggs and when there'smore inside you're losing more so you'relosing all of these eggs throughoutearly fetal development and then upuntil the time period even of pubertywhen you reach puberty you have alessening of the number of eggs in yourovary to the point where it can start torespond to the signals from the brain sowe think about puberty aret in femalesfirst we have really thearchy which isthe development of breasts so thathappens about two years on averagebefore you have minarchy which is yourperiod starting so what happens is thebrain as we know from the hypothalamussends out G&R and then we have FSHcoming out which really starts tostimulate those follicles so fshrfollicle stimulating hormone well-namedhormone for the female of course menhave it too and it's less well- namedfor them but it starts to get thosefollicles which house the eggs to growand make estrogen women have about 2years of estrogen exposure alone sounopposed estrogen with no progesteronebecause they're not yet ovulating andthat's when you start to see breastbudding and you start to see thedevelopment of some of those secondarysex characteristics before you actuallyhave a period what are some of the othersecondary sex characteristics thatprecede menarchy um so you said uhbreast Bud development and then breastdevelopment on average about two yearsbefore before you have sexual hairdevelopment so actually adrin Archy isone of the first usually comes rightbefore at the same time with breast budsso two to three years before you'll seeyour period And so genital hair underarmhair yeah genital hair usually first andthen underarm hair um and we're gettingright down into the weeds here which isgood um you know a goal of this podcastis to normalize all aspects of Healthincluding sexual health and andreproductive Health um is thatcommensurate also with um thedevelopment of body odor yes you knowbecause as a young boy who eventuallyhit puberty and became a young man andnow I suppose I'm in middle age um 48 umI can tell you that the the locker roomsmelled a lot different um be beforebefore and after Middle School rightright like the in other words boys startto smell stinky um right they do yes andthat's usually around that same time ofsexual hair development is when youstart to have those glands around thehair making some of those odors thatstart to produce stink do they reflecthormones themselves not this like thesmell the actual smell doesn't actuallyreflect levels of hormones or anythinglike that it is just that your body yourgonads whether it is testes or ovariesare now starting to respond to thosebrain signals the brain is turned onthey're starting to respond and yourbody is starting to mature in a way toget to the point where it can supportreproduction the reason I asked thatquestion is not to get people thinkingabout um stinky smells but um and by theway some people love the musty smell ofof their own uh armpits or others youknow we're referring to adults um by theway um but the reason I ask is thatthere's a wealth of data in animalmodels including cluding non-humanprimates suggesting that um exposure tothe odors of others can either umstimulate or accelerate puberty um isthere any evidence for that in humans sothere's mild evidence and it's murkybecause we also know that anything thatcould be an endocrine disruptor which alot of scents or fragrances are also canaccelerate the onset of puberty bydisrupting part of this system and so weknow that toxins and you know scents anda lot of the world that we're exposed tois part of the reason why we're seeingpuberty happening at such a younger agenow in females specifically but in bothbut in females than we have before wehave young girls seeing their onset ofmenarchy or their period at a muchyounger age how much younger I I've seenthe various graphs for differentcountries but can we say that you know10 years ago on average um girls in theUnited States and Northern Europe werehitting menarchy at about what 12 to 13years of age yeah so you know startwe'll use menarchy for the purpose ofthis so having your period you know 10to 20 years ago you will see most datawould say oh 13 to 15 would have beenkind of the average age and now we'rereally seeing it shift to be starting at10 to 11 and completing by 1314 so mostgirls are definitely going through thepuberty change earlier and the otherthing to note is that most girls gettheir final height growth right beforethey start their period too so not onlyare we seeing a change in this gettingstarting earlier what we're also seeingis probably some reduction in heightfrom having gone through puberty at anearlier process because once you startactually menstrating once the ovarieshave really started to learn how torespond to that FSH and grow thefollicle and it gets to the point whereyou can start ovulating so about 2 yearslater then that ovulatory period thosehigh levels of estrogen are going to goand they're going to close those growthplates so you've really started to limityour final adult height as well when yougo through puberty earlier and that'sdefinitely something that's a hugeconcern for precocious puberty or veryyoung puberty right and we can useblockers when there are children whostart to exhibit signs of puberty andone of the main reasons people do thatis to try to get them to a greater adultheight if they're really starting to gothrough puberty at a very young age isthat also true for males that it'shappening earlier that earlier pubertymeans that your growth spurt uh in termsof height is going to be uh truncatednot the same and you probably most menwill say oh but I had my growth spur youknow kind of after I started having someof the puberty change that happened butbecause it is this estrogen relatedprocess and women that we see that grossbird really your final height is withinthat year of when your period startsinteresting yeah this uh discussion iscertainly not about me but I was one ofthese what I thought was kind of an oddduck I hit puberty about 1314 um let's just say I knew I did um butI didn't shave until I was after collegemy growth spurt between freshman andsophomore year I grew a foot right so Iwas like you know grew a full foot but Iwas the same weight so I was like realtall real skinny or pretty- tall youknow real skinny and then it seems likeum you know some people in my life wouldargue that puberty is still occurringfor me but it feels like it's very longand protracted which leads me to a a aum a very specific question um if"

puberty rightso a young woman um who's maybe 13 or soso she's early teens um under goespuberty and therefore is contining tolose eggs from the Vault um but now isundergoing uhpresumably roughly every 28 daysmanarchy but let's talk about this 28days thing because I think a lot ofpeople think that um quote unquotenormal menstration is always 28 days andand we know that's not true so what isthe the range of uh normal durationsbetween um menstration uh Cycles orduration of the menstration cycle andand let's also Define when themenstruation cycle starts probably forthe males mostly in the audience suresure so let's think through the cyclewe'll do a quick one over and thenanswer the questions so what we think ofis cycle day one or when you're going tosay this starts is going to be the daythat you start bleeding so that'sactually shedding the endometrial liningfrom what grew the last time so anyspotting even would be considered dayone okay so it is we can get back to itbut there's problematic if you have alot of spotting before that full flowstarts a day or so can be really normaljust as the body's adjusting to the dropin progesterone but let's just start atthe beginning day one you have a perioda menes this is when you're actuallybleeding at this time period we like tothink about all of those new eggs beingout of the Vault being susceptible tothat FSH which of course is thatwell-named hormone because it stimulatesa follicle to grow and each egg is in afollicle that egg starts to grow andmakes estrogen that estrogen stimulatesthe proliferation of the lining of theuterus and preparation for potentiallythat pregnancy that may come and alsothat estrogen makes you feel reallygreat right that's the folicular phasename so because that follicle is growingand it's an FSH dominant phase where youhave a lot of estrogen and people feelgreat when they have a lot of estrogenbecause women feel good with estrogenbecause of the relationship betweenestrogen and other neuromodulators likedopamine serotonin and and is thathappening in parallel or are theysomehow related like is estrogencontrolling the release of Serotoninsomehow and VI Versa or are they justkind of coincidentally happening inparallel we definitely think thatthere's more of a correlation causationthan just coincidence because we knowthere's time periods of people are moredepressed within your cycle correlatingwith those low estrogen levels and weknow that when you go into menopause oryou run out of eggs and you're now in alow estrogen phase we see a lot more ofa depressed mood and you know anadonlack of response to things which wouldnormally give you pleasure happens moremore frequently the female brain lovesestrogen and it's protective againstthings like dementia so this is a timeperiod where women are going to be moreenergetic they're going to have moreenergy more Focus this is the estrogendominant phase of the cycle and when youhave seen that estrogen at its highlevels which it's only made from amature follicle and it's very specific200 pams per milliliter for 50 hoursthat's the brain's clue okay we musthave a mature egg and it can send outthat surge of LH or luttin hormone andnow you ovulate and when you ovulate thefollicle opens up releases closes backand then it's the Corpus ludum and we'veentered the ludal phase and the Corpusludum as the name suggests a corpus it'slike a body that's basically the it'sBas it's basically the the corpse of ofwhat yeah en sheathed the egg before umand it what I find so amazing I meanbiology is so beautiful right it insteadof just taking that tissue and sayingokay like let's just discard this or umthat becomes the trigger for the nextphase of the it is essential for liferight the Corpus ludum which makesprogesterone opens and closes theimplantation window it is what allowssomebody to get pregnant and for ourspecies to continue it's so it'sextremely fascinating and that Corpusludum gets stimulated to produceprogesterone imp pulses throughout theentire ludal phase because it's stillcontrolled by the brain unless you getpregnant and then in that ludal phaseprogesterone is fast ating it's tryingto protect you from things which couldpotentially harm your baby so suddenlynow you have less energy you want tosleep more you want to eat more youmaybe do not want to have sex as muchbecause your body is suddenly sayinglet's just protect this potentialimplantation that you're going to haveif that pregnancy doesn't come theCorpus ludum can only live 12 to 14 daysit has a very distinct lifespan and thenit dies your estrogen and progesteroneboth drop you bleed starting over thenext cycle and a new group of folliclescomes out to be released and the reasonwhy walking through that very succinctlybut is important when you're asking howlong is the normal cycle because theludal phase is pretty set at 12 to 14days the follicular phase can vary inperson to person and what we know thoughis for one individual if your menstrualcycle your reproductive hormones areworking right it should be Relrelatively constant for you and so ifyour periods are every 24 days butthey've always been every 24 to 25 daysthen that's not concerning and if yourperiods are every 33 days but they'vealways been every 33 days then that'snot concerning but we do get concernedwhen there's a change in your period orwe get concerned when people have what Ilike to say is irregularly regularperiods because what you'll seetextbooks tell you is that your periodscould be as short as 21 days as long as35 days and that can all be normal butpeople will hop between them and they'llhave one cycle that is 24 days in lengthfrom day one to the last day before thenext day one then the next Cycle's 32and then it's 26 and then it's 34 andthat's not normal that's too irregularand that can be a sign that something isnot communicating correctly within yourreproductive hormones so what I tellpatients is in general your periodshould be less than 35 days apart andyou should be able to look at a calendarand with your finger put a finger on thedate and within a couple days ofaccuracy be able to predict when yourperiod's coming and if you can't therecould likely be something that isinterfering with the hormonal signalsbetween the brain and the ovary and oneof the biggest really one of the onlythings we see as women start to havefewer eggs in the vault is a shorteningof their Cycles so you have a regularperiod and suddenly now you have lesseggs in the vault so less are coming outeach month and when the brain sends outthat FSH signal now there's fewer eggsso it's not getting as dilute and youhave one starting to respond sooner sosuddenly you're ovulating shorter fasterin your cycle you're ovulating on cycledate 9 instead of 14 your ludal phase isstill set but the person who comes tosee me and says my periods have alwaysbeen 28 to 30 days but now they're every24 I just figure it's no big deal I amhave red flags going off everywherebecause I'm now really concerned thatpotentially their ovarian reserve hasdropped to a point where we are startingto see clinical changes now of coursethings like thyroid and prolactin andother hormones can also cause suchchanges but that's why you'll hear mostreproductive endocrinologists say yourperiod's a Vital sign and what we reallymean is the regularity at which it comesand the predictability of it is tellingus if your hormones are allcommunicating in a normal fashion or ifsomething could potentially be off as weall know quality

about in terms ofegg quality and if they touch on spermquality maybe we can also just mentionthat um but for instance um doescannabis either by edible or by smokingcannabis impact Ed quality in eitherdirection uh alcohol would be the nextand then I'm going to assume and I haveto do this strictly because of what Iunderstand about you know drugs of abuselike cocaine and amphetaminemethamphetamine that none of those canbe good for systems of the body becausethey provide they create so much stressfor the body um but let's just sayalcohol H in cannabis um I read astatistic when researching the episodeon cannabis that shocked me which isthat 15% onefive% not 1.5 15% of American women atleast in this one study survey reportedhaving consumed or smoked cannabisduring known pregnancy which is wildwild unless of course I'm just naive andTHC is not harmful to fetus but I have ahard time believing that so what gives Imean here we and and there I actuallyjust threw in fetal development so iscannabis is Al alcohol bad for eggquality so they're different things andthey're the same thing in one so let'sanswer them each individually so we'llgo with the one that everybody knows andhas accepted now that they wouldn't haveaccepted 40 years ago right smokingcigarettes so that's obviously baddecreases the number of eggs you have inthe vault smoking cigarettes actuallygets into your Vault decreases is thenumber that you have you have a higherchance of going into menopause earlierand it increases the risk of havingabnormal chromosomes which is what wereally think about when we think aboutegg quality right impacting those myoticspindles inside the eggs which hold thechromosomes in their perfect positionthey are associated they get wear andtear from things that cause inflammationor are toxic so cigarette smoke we knowdecreases egg quality egg quantityincreases miscarriage and then of coursehas fetal impacts could I just ask youbecause when we talk about um there'snicotine which itself is notcarcinogenic and then there's thesmoking process which brings in a bunchof other things the the question I knowis burning in everybody's mind is vapingyeah right because vaping is I'm I'mvery bullish on this I mean it's veryclear that the chemicals associated withvaping are just oh so bad forEverybody's Health but it's distinctlydifferent from saying that nicotine isbad for one's health and it can be butum without doing too much of a deep diveis are there any data that show thatvaping is bad for egg quality of coursethere's not as much data because it justhasn't been around as long but yesvaping definitely has chemicals thatlooks like it's associated with poorsuccess rates in IVF cycles and that'sreally kind of one of the most finitemeasures of egg quality we can seebecause we're really testing the egg ata level in a lab versus just are yougetting pregnant naturally and sorry tointerject again but anytime aconversation like this comes upespecially between two people in thehealth science space um there are theseshouts because I hear them literallywhere people say well listen I Vapedevery day and I've had three healthybabies and I think that my response isalways okay there's going to be adistribution of responses and then ofcourse how much healthier could yourbabies have been had you not Vapedduring pregnancy or Vaped prior topregnancy or I mean I think these arethe the key issues that like you can'tyou can't rewind the clock as far as Iknow right in the absence of a Timemachine you can't rewind the clock so umI mean basically everything you'resaying is that smoking cigarettes orvaping nicotine just can't be good foregg quality we know that we know thatit's not good for getting pregnant weknow that it's not good for sperm andtherefore we also know it's going toimpact pregnancy rates you know thingslike cannabis right decreases spermproduction decreases sperm motilitychanges sperm morphology the shape of itchanges the DNA it increases thefragmentation of the DNAif your partner uses cannabis and youget pregnant you have a higher chance ofmiscarriage because of the spermassociation with the Cannabis now ediblecannabis as well as right because youcan't study something that's illegal soa lot of this data is just more new anda lot of it's going to be observationaland in States like Colorado andCalifornia where you know canvas isessentially legal um yeah I I'm assumingthat there are more data but okay so umsmokingEndor vaping nicotine cannabis eitheredible or smoked very likely detrimentalto egg quality and sperm quality whichis not to say that one can't conceive itjust means that the quality of your babyyour child will not be as high as thequality of that baby if you didn't dothat is that right yes and I'm and I'mnot trying to demonize anyone that diddid do this during pregnancy a lot ofpeople didn't know but this is this isreally about people trying to makechoices in anticipation of futurepregnancy yeah and when you're trying toset yourself up for Success because weknow infertility becoming more common wedon't always know who is going to haveit and when you find yourself in thatposition specifically you now want tooptimize everything you can so ifthere's something that is going to makethe sperm quality worse and the Eggquality worse and your success withtreatment lower and your miscarriagerate higher we're going to recommendthat you not do it if you're trying toget pregnant naturally all these thingscorrelate over but of course there'salways going to be outliers andexceptions I'm going to sit here andtell you that the odds of gettingpregnant at age 43 are less than 3% permonth and every single person is goingto be like but my Aunt Barbara or I knowthis person who did because 3% is notzero and you're talking about naturalpregnancy there by by uh interc oldfashioned way yes right but yes sopeople will get pregnant people willhave healthy children who do haveexposures to nicotine to cannabis evento alcohol even though we know thatalcohol can cause fetal alcohol syndrome0% of alcohol should be the acceptablelevel in pregnancy and then does alcoholimpact fertility such a complicatedquestion and this is probably due to theamount you consume and the frequency ofwhich you consume it alcohol is a toxinthat your liver must filter out and WeKnow It causes inflammation anybodywho's had a fun night with alcohol knowsthey can wake up the next day and theyfeel differenttheir body is processing that alcoholand that inflammation especially if it'schronic chronicexposure we know chronic inflammation isone of the things that we see impactingegg quality and sperm quality socertainly if you enjoy alcohol it shouldbe something that is done in moderationone or two drinks a week at the most andyou should not do it at all once youfind out you're pregnant I'd like totake a quick break and thank our

of um people who you know forwhatever reason were forced into orchose to be in the sex trade prostitutesusing um inserting copper coins intotheir vaginal tract to try and uh killsperm but to varying degrees of successobviously there's a whole umsocioeconomic landscape around that soum I think it's obvious what I'mreferring to but um very interesting butthat's just one form of IUD right therethere are some other iuds and thenthere's of course the ring we didn'ttalk about that so maybe we just touchon a few of those in within the contextof whether or not it Alters egg qualityAndor future fertility when one takesthe ring out takes the IUD out this is agreat question because a lot of peopledon't know this and and I'll rollthrough a few of the top birth controlmethods and just thinking through copperIUD as you already said no hormonalinvolvement it causes inflammation and atoxic environment inside the uterusisolated does cause sometimes heavierperiods but they should still be regularif they are irregular that's a sign of ahormonal issue because you still ovulatewith the copper IUD is it literally acopper wire woven into the so the I wellthe IUD is a is a little T and the armsare have copper wires wrapped aroundthem and they and those are they growinto the uterine lining they don't growinto the uterine lining the IUD justsits in there and just the presence ofthat copper causes that inflammatoryreaction in that toxic environment andis it toxic to the environment in waysthat are detrimental to the woman or orjust a sperm both I mean implantation isnot going tooccur likely right I mean no nothing has100% successful but it's much harder foran embryo to implant within that highlyinflammatory environment to me amazingthat people figured this out beforefting Laboratories right let's just putsome copper in some uteruses and seewhat happens right you know it I itreally speaks to the the urgency thatmust have existed to preventingpregnancy and they just how costlybiologically and a pregnancy ispregnancy is and pregnancy is not Healthneutral so it is something that somebodyneeds to be in of right health or it canbe a deadly circumstance when we getback to other iuds so iuds that morepeople are more familiar with are theprogesterone based iuds this is going tobe your Marena Kina liletta they have abunch of different names based on theamount of progesterone and how long theylast for these work mostly by thinningout the uterine lining as we alreadysaid progesteronecompacts the uterine lining to prepareit for implantation in a normal cyclebut if you have constant exposure toProgesterone what is going to happen isit's going to prevent the uterine liningfrom growing and it gets it very verythin not all iuds in fact most of themdon't prevent ovulation only in about50% of people do they actually preventovulation so their main mechanism ofaction is this endometrial effect whenyou remove the IUDespecially if you're already ovulatingno problem the problem we do see in somepeople with progesterone iuds that maybeisn't talked about as much is that thisprolonged progesterone exposure becausepeople are putting iuds in for 5 toseven years and not having a period forthat length of time because theendometrium has become so atropic ornon-existent that you're no longerbleeding despite the fact that you maybeovulating it can take a while for thatlining to grow back and so it's notuncommon to have an IUD in place and ifyou have no period you're going to saythis is great I don't have a periodwonderful you get it removed and nowyour period hasn't come back and thatleads people to sometimes be concernedthat the IUD is causing them not toovulate or they havethis infertility caused by the IUD butreally what it is is that the Liningsbecome so so thin that it can take manymonths of that unopposed estrogenexposure in the follicular phase to getit thick enough to finally bleed whenyou're ovulating so I do tell people ifthey have a progesterone IUD to get itremoved 3 to six months before they wantto get pregnant use some other form ofcontraception but give their body timeto make sure they have that regularperiod pattern back importantdistinction if you're still ovulatingand having a period on an IUD then thisis going to be less of a concern becauseif you're growing enough of a lining tothen shed it we're less worried about itbut if you are amaric or have absence ofyour periods with an IUD we need tothink about removing it for a period oftime before you get pregnant so thatyour body can grow that lining againwhen it comes to some of the otherthings that you mentioned one I youdidn't ask that I want to mention is theDepo pra shot the Depo pra shot is ahigh dose of progesterone high enough toactually prevent ovulation so in thatcircumstance you are not ovulating andtherefore if you don't ovulate at you'renot going to get pregnant Depo pra isproven to prevent ovulation for 3 monthsso when you take it you need to get itevery 3 months to have a provencontraceptive benefit however it canlast in your system for 18 months andprevent ovulation for up to 18 months soI will see people who liked that optionfor

for a year plusbecause this high level of progesteronethat you've already injected into yoursystem can last a substantial amount oftime so that is a contraceptive optionthat I tell people to discontinue a yearand a half to two years before they wantto get pregnant which sometimes peopledon't know that yet and so that'ssomething that can be a contraceptiveoption from if you're very remote

you knowone of the more popular studiesdiscussed on social media is one that II've spent some time with the paper umand a few of the papers that stemmedfrom it um not a huge study butdescribing that how women rate the facesof men as either more essentially whathappens is there there seems to be atleast in this study a there was a astatistically significant um bias uh forwomen to select particular male faces asattractive and those male faces tendedto be of the more you know square jawAKA masculine features right in a quotesright this is what the study um found umbut that when women were on oralcontraception presumably estrogenprogestin type oral contraception thatthat effect um was smeared they had anot a statistically significant tendencyto uh choose the quote unquote moremasculine faces I have to be verycareful with my language here becauseyou know it's easy to get description ofa study like this wrong and that has leda lot of people to think that birthcontrol is going to throw off theirpartner choiceum now of course it's a small study umstudies like it are not always so wellcontrolled um but is there any evidencethat birth control oral oral estrogenprogestin based birth control just tokeep it specific can increase rates ofcancers can decrease rates of cancerscan lead to um any sorts of disruptionsin um bodily uh function or healththat's really like a rock solid resultthat's been seen by mult multiplestudies clinical trials um or are westill just in the dark about a lot ofthis stuff okay so nothing is withoutrisk getting pregnant is not withoutrisk taking the birth control pill isnot without risk we do see that there'sbeen a lot of not informed consent andpeople who are taking the birth controlpill meaning maybe they weren't educatedabout what all of their options were thepositives and the negatives about eachone of them if we're going to referencethe combo to the pill estrogenprogesterone pill important tounderstand that neither the estrogen northe progesterone are the same estrogenprogesterone that your ovaries makeright it's ethanol estradi which yourbrain interprets as an estrogen butother parts of your body may not andthen it's various types of progestinssome of which have even androgenic ormale hormone likee properties and someof which do not so there's a ton ofvariation even the amount of ethanolestrad that each pill has with your lowlow and your low low pills having lessand even with the modern-day averagepill having a lot less estrogen than itused to when you're on the birth controlpill your ovaries aren't makingestradiol and that estradiol isimportant in growing the uterine liningbut also for the genital structures andso we think about vaginal health andbulvar health we certainly see thatespecially with continuous use so if wedistinguish you take the P for 21 daysand you have a 7-Day break where youmight bleed or you take sugar pills andthen you take them again a lot of peoplenow are taking continuously where youhave exposure to these compounds everysingle day H so in in like the the umthe wheel the little little pouch with awheel of different colored pills um mayhave seen these on the on the countertopin previous relationships um and thenthere's the ones that sometimes peoplejust opt not to take because those arethe not the placebo like there's no needto take estrogen during that phase andthen and then they repeat is thatexactly okay but some people are takingestrogen all way very common right nowso people and they're not wrong they sayoh well why have a period in theselittle breaks it's not really areflection of my hormone status which isaccurate and so they're taking themcontinuously you also have less pillfailure pregnancies so if you're usingthe pill for contraception that can be agreat strategy but the longer you takethem we do see some vaginal involv artchanges right and so atrophic vaginitispeople who notice increased sensitivitydecreased elasticity increase discomfortwith intercourse increase in like yeastinfections that can sometimes be seebecause that environment is differentnow that's just one thing that can comefrom the pill we also see the pill belife saving for other people they haveterrible you know PMS or premenstrualdysphoric syndrome where their mentalhealth when they change from from highto low estrogen it's always the changein estrogen that interferes can causesome people to really have mental healthissues that are so severe that havingthat stable hormone level is helpful andso the pill can be extremely beneficialfor some people when it comes to mentalhealth it can be beneficial for peoplewho have issues with very heavy periodsand anemia instead of getting bloodtransfusions you know taking the birthcontrol pill might prevent the lining ofthe uterus from growing so much thatthey bleed so much same with fibroidspeople with PCOS PCOS is polycysticovarian syndrome if we want to put itvery simply you have a lot of eggs inyour Vault so you release a lot of eggsevery month and what this does is theFSH signal gets diluted and so you'renot responding to the normal signal andyou don't ovulate and because the ovaryis a hormone making factory it getsreally bored when it can't make estrogenbecause that egg's not growing so itstarts to make testosterone so you startto see this Androgen dominantenvironment associated with lack ofovulation and having a lot of folliclesinside the ovary that are not reallyresponding an androgen excuse meandrogenization of other tissues likelike body hair deepening of voice bodyhair typically the level of testosteronemade in PCOS isn't truly deepening voiceit can if there is an ovarian tumormaking testosterone or certain otherconditions but typically with PCOS yousee increase in body hair increase inacneand you can see some even like malepattern balding some temporal balding ofwomen so some hair loss temporal B solike the the WID yeah the Widow peakingand then thinning out in these two areasand then we see an increase in bodycomposition towards a male level so ifwe think about a male body holding yourfat in your abdominal region and if wethink about the traditional female bodyholding more fat in the hips and thighsarea we see that when this hormoneshifts in PCOS you tend to get moreabdominal fat distribution which thenleads to further insulin resistance andmetabolic syndrome but in PCOS becauseyou're notovulatingand those ovaries each little folliclemakes a tiny amount of estrogen we'llsay each little follicle when it's notresponding will make you know one to twopeagrams of estrogen but if you have 50of them each month you're having someconstant estrogen exposure so thatlining of the uterus is being constantlystimulated to grow and you're nevergetting the progesterone to stabilize orthe progesterone withdraw to bleed soendometrial cancer is much higher inpeople with PCOS who don't ovulate andthe birth control pill can prevent thatany unopposed estrogen situation becausethe body is made to have both estrogenand progesterone so we see an immensedecrease in endometrial cancer animmense drop in ovarian cancer ovariancancer comes from the remodeling of theovary so every time you have a folliclegrow and it ruptures and it makes takesthe Corpus ludum and then it heals upthose are opportunities for those cancercells to go away in that remodelingprocess and lead to ovarian cancer andbecause you're not ovulating on the pillyour incidence of ovarian cancer dropsdramatically 10 years of pel use hasdropped the chance you get ovariancancer by more than 90% And of courseovarian cancer is super hard to diagnosebecause the inovation to the peritonealsystem is is poor and you don't have anyoutward signs often to late stagedisease that beingsaid could you potentially have anincrease in breast cancer in some peopleby taking the Pill by taking the pillthat that's a concern especially inpeople who might be predisposed to thisfor some other reason they might havebraa mutations or something like that umand then is there a situation where thepill certainly masks what's going onwith your menstrual cycle and I reallythink this is where where Women's Healthhad has a huge history in paternalismmeaning doctors would just tell peoplethis is what you're going to do so yourperiods are irregular here is the birthcontrol pill and they're not explainingwhy or the pros and cons to it and whathappens is people are not being taughthow their bodies work and now they arebecause of your podcast amongst othersand now they're able to know that myperiods of Vital sign and I don't knowwhat it is because the pill is producinga different environment the pill's alsobeen associated with potentiallydevelopment of things like leaky gut orIBS and so

saythat's not the norm right like that'snot the recommendation when you'retalking about putting somebody on thebirth control pill you want to make surethey don't have high blood pressurebecause it can increase their bloodpressure you want to make sure theydon't smoke cigarettes because thecombination of the pill and cigarettesmoking can increase the risk of astroke but the recommendation is not toscreen them to see if they have anyinherited clotting disorders that saidif you ever have a blood clot on thebirth control pill because you'retraveling on a plane or you're just onthe pill or you're living your lifeyou're now going to get this extensivework up to find out if you do have thatit's by no means wrong and specificallyyou should if anybody in your family hasever had a DVT so a deep vein thrombosisso blood caught in their leg or apulmonary embolism or a PE so anybody inyour family has had one of those youshould have 100% get worked up forclotting disorders and if you havesomething like you carry Factor 5 youshould no longer take the birth controlpill and specifically the pill becauseit's an oral pill and how it'smetabolized in the liver is actuallywhat is causing the change in thoseclotting factors because that's wherethey're made as well so it doesn't meanyou can't take any form of contraceptionbut we do want to make sure that wecounsel you appropriately I never thinkit's wrong to be an advocate for yourown health or to ask questions it'simportant to know that screening I meanI'll get on my soap box because we'lltalk about screening for ovarian reserveand it is 100% not recommended eventhough I think it should be yeah my nextquestion was going to be about testingamh levels and um and we'll return tothat for those that hear that and itsounds cryptic as well as getting anultrasound just seeing basically howmany how many eggs are are in likely tobe in in the Vault on on both sides okayso we have to remember that screeningrecommendations come from at what pointin the population does it make sense tospin the money to test for a diseasebased on the likelihood of finding it soif we think about right that's what yourpapsmear guidelines and your colonoscopyand your mammograms everything is allbased on when are you going to findenough cases at some age to make itworthwhile testing which is a crazyprinciple especially in the US becausethe government's not paying for ourhealth care so why should theseguidelines be based on when is it costeeffective to do testing well I I'll putin a this is going to sound sound alittle bit conspiratorial but it's not Imean I think that given that for peoplewho have insurance private paidinsurance or through their work um thatthere's a cost to doing these tests ofany kind colonoscopy amh Etc and theymust have figured out the you knowoptimal point on the graph with whichthey can reduce their payout to peoplewho for instance get colon cancer ifthey didn't get the colonoscopy at 45 asopposed to 50 as opposed to 60 asopposed to 25 I mean this is I mean thereality we know is thatthe more information you have the betterchoices you can make I mean the onlycaveat to that would be that uh for somenot all but for some people sort of ofthe hypochondria type sometimes moreinformation leads to more anxiety whichleads to more problems but that's a rareinstance that is I always think that ingeneral data is always good age havingthe information at hand about your bodyand being able to make educated choicesversus being in a position where you sayI had no idea that I had Factor 5 Li inand I had this terrible blood clotbecause pulmonary emms can kill peoplewe all know that right so we talk aboutthis rare thing but it can happen butthis is really where it can be tough itcan be tough to find even a doctor whomade like we said Factor five is a bloodtest and relatively inexpensive so thatone is not hard but Physicians live in aweird world where you know they haverecommendations based on screening basedon the likelihood of finding diseasethat they follow and when they go off ofthose they start introducing themselvesto why are you not following medicalguidelines but for anindividual this is really tough toadvocate for yourself and the one thingthat I'll say too this is why payingattention to your body is so importantright understanding your

amh okay Imean I totally disagree but I'm glad youdisagree I mean to me it just seems nutsI mean um or ovaries rather I mean theum the amh is a blood draw amh is ablood test it's a blood draw it onecould opt to do the um ultrasound aswell which is of course more invasivebut but women who are seeing their OBGYNare probably familiar with with with umpelvic exams yeah I mean it's a FALultrasound but it's not painful notpainful um but different than a blooddraw just just for in full disclosure soum and you know I've heard of women intheir early 30s going in getting theiram levels checked getting theirultrasound and then going oh my goodnessthey're down to like you know I I don'twant to throw out numbers cuz thisactually can get tricky it um you knowthey'll say oh you have whatever youknow four follicles and then someone intheir early 40s will have 20 folliclesand then people start to is it sort ofbecomes a scorekeeping thing and and ofcourse follicle quality there a bunch ofother things um and then you can tell usmore about those but let's say someonedid not have insurance or or Insurancepermission to um to get this paid forwhat is the approximate cost of gettingone's amh levels and analyzed $79 $79 tofind out essentially where your ovarianreserve is at so let's talk about this Ialready said this in my soap box so ACOGsays you shouldn't screen it because amhdoes not predict your fundability rightyour body's ability to get pregnant inthat month is independent of your amhand for the most part that's true rightbecause let's say you have a person andthey're both 30 you have two people onehas low ovarian reserve they have fiveeggs coming out of the Vault and thisone has normal ovarian reserve and theyhave 20 eggs coming out of the Vault andwe should probably clarify that thenumber of because you said this earlierbut the number of eggs coming out of thevault is an indirect measure of how manyeggs is in the vault when that number isgoing down it means the number of eggsin the vault is likely going down downcorre sort of like your body starts totake smaller withdrawals as you start torun out of the Vault wants to be at likeequilibrium right it really wants to bein this Middle Ground so when you havetoo many it shoots out more every monthit's too crowded it doesn't want thatand then when it starts to get low itgets scared about being empty and sendsout fewer per month so what you seeoutside the Vault and that is called ananal follicle count or an AFC it's anultrasound based measurement of how manyeggs you have outside the vault at onepoint in time and on the ultrasound ifone looks um this is going to show up asso what look like um little Hollowspaces like so not gray stuff but butHollow Bodies I say chocolate chips andthe chocolate chip cookie if we canimagine the over yeah like looks like achocolate chip cookie the chocolatechipssmall little dark fluid fill follicleseach one of those houses an egg somebigger than others because they're moremature than others based on when youcheck in the cycle so if you're lookingin that early follicular phase whensomebody's on their period they're theyall should be small because nothing'sbeen stimulated if I'm looking perulatory I'll see that dominant folliclethat's about to ovulate and theneverything else will be small and isthere a a graph that people can look ator that we could link to that says okaythe the average with a distribution ofyou know standard error on their sidefor let's say a 28-year-old woman or a37y old woman or a 45y old woman of thenumber of follicles on the right andleft side and as I understandasymmetries are common yeah um tends tobe you know like if someone goes in andthey you got six follicles on the leftside and 12 on the other side are theyhow do how do people gauge what whatfantas points one because their doctorsshould tell them but that doesn't alwayshappen but yes we we add these countstogether to get your anro follicle countbecause there is often asymmetry butwhat we should expect let's say insomebody who's 30 is you should have inthe 16 to 20 range of total folliclesper month right and left side combinedcomined okay when you're 35 that numberis closer to like 14 to 16 so startingto drop it's still pretty good whenyou're 40 it's 8 to 10 when you're 44 2to 4 right so you start to have thisimmense drop that exponentially startsto increase really around AG 37 sothings start to kind of get into thissevere Zone really after age 37 and wedidn't really talk about ages 18 to 25but there are people who get pregnant inthat age bracket are is the folliclecount very very high is there sort of ana is a nonlinear drop off or yeah theirfollicle count would be higher and Imean I occasionally have patients whoare very young but have infertility orwant to freeze their eggs I've also hadpatients in that age range who are inpremature ovarian failure right rightbecause there can be things that gowrong even early but we should probablyhighlight again something that you said"

vaultyou're not pulling From the Vault you'renot you can't right that those eggs arespent you you you now have theopportunity to turn them into potentialpregnancies correct I mean side noteright we haven't even dove into IVF butthat's the next wave of technology iswhat we call IVM in vitro maturation aretrying to figure out how can you geteggs from the Vault and get them to growin the lab because that would open uppossibilities for people who have fewereggs to have a higher efficiency of thisprocess because one of the limitingfactors when you're doing fertility whenyou're doing egg freezing or IVF is howmany eggs can you get per month andthat's why some people have to do cycleafter cycle because they can only getfive eggs or five eggs but if we Circleback to what we were saying when we gotoff on this beautiful tangent is that nono matter if you have five or you have20 eggs outside the Vault you'reovulating one so you're trying to getpregnant naturally that's whatfundability is probability of gettingpregnant per month naturally you havethe same chance if you're the same ageregardless of if you have five eggs oryou have 20 eggs and that's why ACOGcame in and said well amh doesn't impactfundability it doesn't predict yourability to get pregnant or who's goingto have infertility and who's not goingto have infertility so there's noutility and screening for itin people now for once I'm speechless Imean that that argument makes sensethrough the lens of just probabilitiesofpregnancy um through natural conceptionum but it completely erases the veryvery very real situation where peopleare making choices about for instancewhether or not to stay with a givenpartner whether or not to leave a givenpartner whether or not to accelerate theprocess of building a family my eggshould I have a baby now goodness likethere's so manythis American College of whoever whoeveris likecompletely but they're crazy and that'swhat I say they they argue in theirstatement that finding that you havesorry I'm like reeling it in I meanthink trying to think of an analogy thatdoesn't fail but it's like if you canit's like saying okay if you can walknow great there's no reason to test forthis inevitable paralysis that's goingto happen at different rates indifferent people and there are thingsthat you can do to offset in other wordsyou could like take a little bit of sometissue that will allow you to walk inthe future but we're not going to dothat because if you can walk now you canwalk now it's good now that's absurd andthat's really what it is and they saywell finding out that you have lowovarian reserve at a young age is goingto cause undue stress that isunwarranted because most people don'thave infertility and so they're purelyputting it through the lens of yourlikelihood to get pregnant but it'sactionable stress exactly right if itwere just stress like hey guess what andyou know I know people who have familymembers with Huntington mutations andsome opt to not know whether or not theythemselves have have the Huntingtonmutation and and it's a very personalchoice right sure but here that whereasunfortunately there still isn't a a curefor Huntington hopefully someday therewill be malom would but in the meantimethere's essentially a a cure for thissituation which is the Harvest andpotential fertilization there at leastan opportunity and this is what I sayand of course you and I feel similarlyeducation and data like being the one tomake the choice way is an extremelyimportant distinction versus having ithappen to you so if you're young and youfind out you have low ovarian reserve isthat going to make a difference and itvery well might you might now freezeyour eggs when you wouldn't haveotherwise you might now start to try toget pregnant if you're partnered whenyou otherwise were just waiting butchange the conversation with yourpartner too right because a lot ofpeople think they can just wait I you belike because of age right we're intotally wait but if you have a lowovarian reserve then that you may losethe opportunity for Parenthood and for alot of people this is a life goal andthis is what's Wild to me when on earthbesides reproduction do we have lifegoals that we take the approach I'lljust wait and see if it's a problemlater never right if you want to becomea doctor you want to become an athleteyou are constantly working towards thatgoal or understanding what it's going totake to get there but why does the goalof Parenthood the attitude is completelyI'm not going to think about it untillater and then I'll deal with it if itbecomes a problem because you can makechange choices you could freeze youreggs you could try to get pregnantsooner you could evaluate for reasons oflow ovarian reserve do you have agenetic mutation or an autoimmunedisease why is it low it's not justalways a big unknown there can be someactual things that potentially might beimpactful for your health long term so Ithink it's it's wild that this is thecurrent conversation and I will say Iknow personally a lot of OBGYN who 100%will draw an amh blood test if you're atyour annual and you ask and I recommendall of my OB friends because I seepeople at a different stage right whenthey see me they're struggling to getpregnant or they want to freeze theireggs but when we talk about this I sayhey just like you say are you trying toget pregnant now and if somebody says noand follow-up question is well do youwant to be on birth control the samequestion should be well do you want tobe pregnant at some point and if soshould you consider freezing your eggsor getting this blood test checked andvery often people will make a differentdecision with that information well I'mso glad that you're highlighting this"

um there's ahard cut off at age I think it is 42prior to age 42 they'll do it um after42 they'll do it if and only if you'rewilling to do invitro fertilization toactually fertilize and then they'llfreeze embryos but they're far morereluctant to collect eggs after age 42yes yes and no so when you think aboutegg freezing and IVF are really the sameprocess right when you're going throughthe exact same thing you're taking theeggs out of the body and then you'reeither just freezing them as an egg oryou're fertilizing them in the lab andthat's IVF and making an embryo rightaway egg freezing has changeddynamically over the past 10 yearswhereas 10 years ago survival rate ofeggs in the lab was 40% really terribleand so we really didn't offer it to manypeople it wasn't something that wastalked about and now it feels trendyalmost but it's really just the tech hasgotten so much better and cheaper yeah90% of eggs now survive the free thaw so90% is not a low number by any meansembryos are much stronger right an eggis a single cell it's a single cell anembryo when we freeze an embryo that'sday five or six is 300 plus cells soit's so much stronger and those embryossurvive the freeze thought 99% of thetime so yes there's a 9% difference thatbeing said making embryos is a lot moreexpensive eggs is cheaper you could dotwo rounds of eggs and have just as manyeggs or have more eggs than if you'dmade them into embryos right away so Inever recommend that somebody commits toa sperm source that they don't want tohave a child with unless that that's thesperm Source they want to have a childand this has changed because when embryosurvival was so much greater than eggsurvival especially if you had few eggsor you were older making embryos was theonly option what we do know is that eggquality decreases immensely as we getolder and we've touched on this but wehaven't really mentioned it so not onlydo you have fewer eggs as you get olderthe chromosomes inside start to losetheir positioning and so we think aboutegg quality we think about geneticnormaly and we know that the rates ofanupy or abnormal chromosomes increasesproportionally to your age which um forpeople that aren't aware are going topredispose not always um to miscarriagesif they're implanted or potentially evenuh the formation of a of a fetus thatcarries for instance tricomes so CHchromosomal repeats or um lack of lackof certain chromosomes these could bedeadly or they could be um capable ofcarrying to term and then but haveundetectable Demi to severedevelopmental um abnormalities correctcorrect and this is this is why it youhave a lower probability of pregnancyper month as you get older so if we lookat your natural fundability it's notbecause you have fewer eggs because wealready said your egg count per monthdoesn't impact your probability ofgetting pregnant it's because thenormaly of those chromosomes has changedso dramatically that the odds that yourbody's randomly choosing the good one toovulate become so low and that's whythose natural fertility rates are so lowbecause most genetically abnormal eggsdo not fertilize or implant but if theydo they have a significantly higherchance of miscarriage it's 40% at age 40right so you have a much lower chance ofseeing the positive pregnancy test butthen your chance of losing thatpregnancy is significantly higher aswell so when we are counseling somebodyabout egg phrasing what we know is thatnot every egg is going to fertilize withsperm going to make an embryo going tobe genetically normal or even implantwhen it is genetically normal there ishuge loss in human reproduction meaningthe more eggs you have at a younger agethe better the ROI on this process isgoing to be it doesn't mean you youdon't do it when people get older butevery Clinic does have a cut off andevery Clinic is going to be a little bitdifferent a lot of different reasons whywe actually probably have an older cutooff so we will let somebody go throughIVF or freeze their eggs up to age 45and it's a lot about informed consentandhaving the approach that you're smartenough that if I give you the odds and Iwalk you through how many eggs you areand the likelihood of them making intoembryos you can say yeah but for or 10eggs is way more than zero based on mycircumstance and that is worth it to mebecause it gives me the opportunity topotentially have a child when otherwisemy opportunity is going to be zero so alot of this is rooted in paternalismthat people can't as a patientunderstand these odds and they haveunrealisticexpectations I think there's a hugeshift in Reproductive Medicine to reallycounseling patients and giving themautonomy and some of these decisions butthere does become a point where there'sthe likelihood of finding a normal eggis so so low that the money or theexpense of the process doesn't makesense and people should utilize eggdonation or other opportunities forconception this drop in both the numberof eggs and the Egg quality they reallystart to become so profound at age 37and on and that's when we really startto see both these things are overlappingat the same time so if you're waitingtill age 35 36 for your first kid butyou want two or three we've got toreally look forward about is that isthat strategy makes sense well what isyour amh one are you going to run out ofeggs before then two how what otherissues could be going on is the spermfine are the tubes open because we areseeing that when people start familieslater when people have more chronicillness and autoimmune disease andobesity that it's much harder to getpregnant and so the birth rates rightfor the first time in a long time acrossthe board are dropping and infertilityis rising because of all of thesefactors combined So based on everythingyou just said and and yes I'm going tosay it a fifth time because themisconception about this is one of theprimary reasons why people avoidharvesting eggs it's not the only reasonbut when you harvest eggs freeze themnow sounds like the viability of thoseeggs is is quite quite strong compared afew years ago uh so that's great 90% uhrecovery uh when they thaw them um isnot going to diminish the number of eggsin the vault such a critical point umand post age 37 there's a sounds like anonlinear drop off in egg quality formost and these are averages right soevery be so the people that got pregnantwith healthy kids in their late 30s and40s you know yes we hear you umcongratulations we're happy um but thisspeaks to the kind of the the logicanyway we're not putting any emotion orcircumstances on this but the logic ofsomebody in their let's say late 20searly 30s getting their amh levelsthrough a roughly $80 blood draw um andthen perhaps based on their life goalsand circumstances doing either one orseveral rounds of egg collection andfreezing especially since it sounds likeyou don't need to fertilize those eggsso if one doesn't have a partner isconcerned about what they're going to dowho's who's going to be uh who's goingto provide the sperm you know um becauseof course some people choose to raisekids on their own um but parenting is awhole other issue but um they could dothat later so that raises the questionsof what are the health risks if any um"

platelet rich plasma excuse me uh PRPin perhaps even into the ovarian Vaultwe can get back to that so there's abunch of stuff that's being done tosomeone there's low stem where peopleare getting like low doses of thesedrugs there's High stem where it's likea full blast Maybe you could walk usthrough that procedure and just sort ofGeneral Contour because it you know itwould require a lot of time to gothrough it all in detail but is this ahorrible thing to go through is it mildto go through is it like a walk in thepark um let let's walk through it all soI I love this and this is my bread andbutter and this is what I do every daystudies tell us that if you are notready to have a family by age 32 to 33that that is the optimal time for theaverage person to intervene and freezetheir eggs it's not up for debate it'swhen you have both the intersection ofstill a good egg quality and Good Eggquantity on average and so that isyounger than a lot of people arethinking about having families and thereason why is when we really think aboutwhat happens to the egg afterward that'swhat's really critically important soI'm going to answer the question aboutwhat you go through but just thinking wealready said you freeze your eggs 90% ofthem are going to survive the freeaabout 75% will be fertilized by spermand about 50% of those will even make itto an implantation stage embryo or ablastic we're assuming healthy sperm sosperm sperm no DNA excessive DNAfragmentation you already hit the nailon the head one of the biggest issueswith egg freezing is I don't know thefuture I don't know if this sperm isgoing to be great or not I don't itcould be from a pot smoker just kiddingpot smokers not kidding pot smokerswe're not but we don't know right so wehave this future yet undetermined spermsource so I am going to assume you'regoing to fall average on these datapoints that we're going to walk throughbut the reality is you buffer the riskby having more eggs frozen and that'swhy people are going through multiplerounds or Cycles because we don't knowwe don't know how that fertilizationwill be if you have 20 eggs and 18survive the freeze thaw and 14 fertilizeand seven make it to the blasticus stageif your age 30 we would anticipatearound 60 to 70% of them are going to begenetically normal and you're young sothat's already kind of a big hit at thatage so let's say of the seven four ofthem are genetically normal when I go totransfer them I have at best a 65%chance of live birth per embryo which isreally good when you put in the lens offundability and Peak success tends to becloser to 20% and you're going toimplant one embryo at a time 100% we'regoing to implant one embryo at a timenow does anyone ask for two people askfor two doctors will do two it is itlowers live birth rates if we're lookingat giving each embryo the healthiestopportunity of becoming a baby numberone embryos with IVF have a slightlyhigher chance of monozygotic twinningright so twinning fraternal twinningcomes if you ovulate two eggs they bothget fertilized so each baby iscompletely different genetically own eggown sperm monozygotic is from an embryosplit because of the IVF processlikely putting the embryo in thecatheter maybe having that you knowouter surface touched pred disposes itto splitting after you put it into thebody so more identical twins mono two to3% chance of monozygotic twins with IVFand the natural chance is 0.003% sosignificantly higher even thoughultimately not a probable outcome I'mgoing to have a couple patients a yearwho are going to have monozygotic twinsand if I put two embryos in I've now onetaken this from a potential twinpregnancy to a triplet or even a quad ifthey both split so hence presumably likethe octomom cases and things like thatwell that one they just literally puteight embryos inside but that's a wholeI mean that's medical malpractice rightbut really most the time when we'retalking about embryos we're talkingabout people with infertility or peoplewho spent a significant amount of moneya huge portion of fertility is embryoquality right the competency of theembryo the genetics of the embryo it'sexpensive to go through egg freezing andIVF yet the uterine environment isanother component it doesn't make senseto waste multiple embryos in the sameuter environment statistically itdoesn't make sense it also doesn't makesense to make your embryos competeagainst each other so will people putone embryo into let's just say DNA Momright and one into surrogate mom and andtry and get two siblings umsimultaneously I've definitely done thatand had patients do that it's not commonbecause surrogacy using a gestationalcarrier is so expensive and there's sucha limited Supply it's very hard to findsomebody who wants to go through the actof carrying a child for somebody elsebut that definitely is a strategy thatsome people utilize especially ifthey're older or they're concerned thatthey might have a lower chance ofimplantation but they want to givethemselves a try but if we look at oneembryo 65% chance of success cumulativeprobability after the second is88% okay almost everybody's pregnantafter two and these are euploidgenetically normal Embryokay and then if you go to the third socumulatively after three euploid embryotransfers each one being a single embryo95% of people have a baby in their armsmeaning the incidence of her currentimplantation failure is actually prettylow5% but how many normal embryos do youneed for what family size if you'refreezing your eggs because you got 20eggs at age 30 and the example I gaveand you just made four normal embryosright so so that's really unlikely tomake three or four kids it would it hasa really good chance of making one givesyou the opportunity for a second butthat's also presuming that everythinghappened perfectly that the sperm is notpot smoking sperm but you know what Imean not bad quality sperm there's notother environmental issues when it comesto your own health when you're trying toget pregnant or other diseases you mayhave so we really need a higher numberof eggs specifically when we don't knowwhat the equation will truly look likefor one individual person when they gothrough the process and one of the onlyadded benefits of embryos especially ifyou are partnered if you're withsomebody who you do want to havechildren with you just don't want tohave them yet is that I know thedownstream I know the number I know howmany embryos I have and if it's notenough to give you a high chance of whatyou want your family to be you canintervene now right because bydefinition with egg phrasing we're notwanting to be pregnant for years so ifyou're doing this with a partner andyou're making embryos and now I say weonly got one genetically normal embryoyou have the opportunity to choose toeither go through more cycles and storemore embryos for later to maybe try toget pregnant sooner because there's someunderlying issue with your fertility youcan make a choice because you're fallingoff the curve there could ask you aquestion so this uh you mentioned ageabout 32 33 in an ideal circumstancewith the finances there Etc one wouldHarvest eggs unless they're alreadystarting a family through natural meansum what about for sperm I mean we we'veall heard the studies that uh with"

of yourbody is exactly the same right thedistinction between egg freezing and IVFis all about what happens on the lab endof it after they've come out of yourbody so if we have this group of eggsthat comes out of the Vault your bodydoesn't want to allow them all to groweven if it's a low number right that'sthe check in Balance to not have so manykids so we need to override that processand what we tend to do with this is touse a combination of hormonalmedications and very often I describe itto patients as suppressing your body andthen stimulating it so if I cantemporarily stop the production of FSHand you have a group of eggs come out ofthe Vault and we can imagine that FSH istheir food and there is no food becauseyou're taking the birth control pill for3 weeks these eggs are going tosynchronize be very small be very hungryfor lack of a better word their FSreceptors are going to open all up it'slike a nest of baby birds that are allnow starving instead of the hungry birdgets the worm so now we go with thissuppression period for a few weeks wecan come in and give gatot tropen whichis FSH and LH FSH is now syntheticallymade in a lab it's very easy it's asynthetic compound that mimics thestructure of the brain FSH we actuallycan't synthetically make LH veryinteresting we don't have a way to makeit yet and so we use the purified urineof menopausal women because when you'rein menopause your FSH and LH levels arenaturally so high because they're tryingto get that egg to make some estrogen soum here are some the we've covered malehormone Health before um and there'sbeen a discussion of HCG human chonicgenotropin and which is essentiallymimics LH in in the receptor it does yesright so is um pregal at uh human chonicgonadotropin is it purified frompostmenopausal women's urine or is ITNit's synthetic HCG is synthetic and sowhat why can't I'm talking about it'scalled minpure minpure is a combinationof FSH and LH the reason why we give HCGto men to try to stimulate thespermatogenesis process which of courseif we could just give LH we' give LHit's the same reason why we give HCG fora trigger if we going to go throughfertility treatments and we're trying tomimic that LH surge which naturallywould cause ovulation we actually aregiving HCG because it does mimic LH whenit comes to the receptor action of itbut when it comes to really especiallyin getting follicular development andthe relationship between LH and FSHmeaning LH is really providing some ofthe hormone substrate that we need to beable to make estrogen and so you reallyneed some LH in a lot of peopledepending on your protocol or if you'reolder and you're naturally making lessthe example or the offshoot would belike the PCOS patient who has somenaturally High LH sometimes they don'tactually need LH in their protocol butso who are these post menaa women thatare supplying their Ur they're paid yeahI S imagine them on some Island someplace yeah yeah go go to the menopausegetting paid to urine it and it's calledmenure like it's purified menopausalurine right wild most people don't knowthat they know now now they know and sowe use FSH and LH we'll just say in lackof better terms those are the twoprimary compounds that we're giving overthe course of on average a 12-day periodto get the follicles to grow grow andthe eggs to mature so you can measureegg maturity by blood levels ofestradiol and by transvaginal ultrasoundso when you're going through eggfreezing or IVF you're taking thesehormone shots of FSH and LH and they aregetting those follicles to start to growthe eggs are starting to mature we'remonitoring them along the way trying todetermine the time period where we thinkmost of the eggs will be in the maturerange these eggs have gotten to matureyou then are going to take a triggershot which allows that final stage ofmeiosis so those chromosomes canseparate right we think about the egg weremember that normal female genetics46xx and I always think about in the eggthat these chromosomes are lined up youreggs are Frozen inside your body whenyou're born your eggs are in metaphaseof meiosis so that's when metaphasechromosomes meet in the middle andthey're held apart by these meioticspindles and this is why are so stinkand fragile because they're held likethis and those myotic spindles justabsorb the wear and tear of your lifebut when you use that trigger shot thatLH surge naturally or that HCG in acycle that's when you're going to getthat final separation into half the eggsyou know half those chromosomes into theegg so for people listening think aboutum like a zipper and you're pulling apart of a of a zipper that then you nowhave the the chromosomes just one oneyou now have haveed the chromosomesbecause why because in successfulfertilization the other chromosomes aregoing to come from sperm the sperm andthat's why this process has more errorthe older you are and the longer yourchromosomes have been sitting

wehaven't even gone through the wholeprocess but the first IVF baby there'sno FSH LH to stimulate more of the eggsoutside the Vault to grow so theyfollowed the single follicle and theydidn't have the procedure which we donow which is a minimally invasiveprocedure procedure to extract eggs wego vaginally with a needle attached tothe ultrasound and we enter into eachfollicle and we drain it the very firstIVF you followed one follicle and youwent in abdominally with a surgery toget put that needle into the follicleand drain it out and give that just oneegg a chance and then of course therewas no embryo freezing originally so thefield is still rather young tounderstand some of this and astechnology rapidlyimproves we see things like bettersuccess rates with freezing and Thaembryos better process of getting moreembryos to grow but now we have a lot ofembryos in storage that may or may notbe used I personally tell people youshould keep your embryos you should paythe storage fee until no matter what theworst thing on planet Earth happens toyou you're down having children becausesadly I live in a spectrum with my fieldwhere I see a lot of sadness and peoplewho maybe have lost a child somethingelse has happened and they have maybe asibling who they feel like they reallywant to give this sibling child thechance to be a sibling again and oftenyou're much older when you'reexperiencing this and if you had hadembryos Frozen that you could have usedbut you got rid of them you're going tobe really upset if you find yourself inthat circumstance so I always say youshould save them until you know that youare not going to need them and then whatdo you do with them most people justdiscard them some people will donatethem to Labs which is called forresearch but mostly it's forembryologist training to get better atdoing better which is also importantokay um but embryo donation is a newthing so being able to just like we havepeople who donate sperm and donate eggsembryo donation is the next evolution ofan opportunity to allow more people tobecome parents it's a little bit of theWild West people finding people inFacebook groups and connecting it's thiswhole other Dynamic when it comesto what we call third party reproductionor you know what do you do with knowndonors and things like that but it's avery interesting concept so this problemisemerging as the technology is gettingbetter I I'm realizing now umremembering rather that when I was incollege and graduate school you wouldsee these um ads in the student paperfre for egg donors and sperm donors umsperm regenerate throughout the lifespanso that's a kind of less controversialissue but this is now not allowed mostplaces to advertise for for egg donorson college campuses that's myunderstanding um the egg donors wereoften paid whatever whatever they werepaid I'm not going to say it wasreasonable amounts or not because Idon't I don't recall what they were paidand everyone's circumstances aredifferent but the argument that mostpeople use against this is oh thesethese people are giving up eggs thatthey could otherwise use but we now knowthat's not true so um do you have anyknowledge as to like what was the um therationale for for kind of limiting therecruitment of egg donors um anyway I'mnot arguing for or against I just I it'sno longer supported based on what you'vesaid by the um by the argument thatthey're losing eggs they would otherwisebe able to some of about proper consentuh especially at an age where thefinancial incentive can be verypersuasive without understanding thatmakes sense not that it harms yourfertility later but that you're going tohave genetic children out there and youmight potentially and we are seeing thisnow we don't know if you individuallywill have infertility for a variety ofreasons because you're not trying tohave a family until much later but thesame concern doesn't seem to exist formen who are donating sperm like I meanit should there's this whole donorconceived Community where people arereally talking about putting newrestrictions on will you sperm donationfor example there are sperm donors whohave hundreds of children hundreds rightthere are these sibling pods becauseit's been so unlimited and sperm banksare a business that work to make moneyand they make money by selling moresperm but that's not healthy one for apopulation you need genetic diversitybut also it's not healthy necessarilyfor one person to have all these halfsiblings and to just not know whenyou're going to run into somebody whocould potentially be your sibling is itthis guy at the bar that you like do youhave to worry about that if you're donorconceived so we're starting to see spermbanks finally start to reel back and putlimitations on how many families totalchildren's tough right because onefamily might have a child and you wantthem to be able to have sibling childrenbut at least for how many families thatthat donor can contribute to and we'reseeing sperm donors deal with the factthat now there's no Anonymous donationwe can act like Anonymous donationexists meaning it is not identified atthe time that somebody's utilizing thesperm but with you know direct toConsumer Testing for genetics like 23and me and ancestry people are beingconnected with their sperm donors withtheir egg donors with their sibling podsand we have to believe that technologyis only going to improve over timeso what people do for money especiallywhen they're young I think withoutunderstanding the potentialramifications and I don't want to actlike sperm donation or egg donation arebad they give people the opportunity tobecome parents that otherwise might notbe able to and that is a lovely and abeautiful gift but you need tounderstand what that might mean and howthat might impact your own potentialchildren later too to know know thatthey have genetic half siblin out thereegg donation people do get compensatedmuch better than sperm donation thereare certain characteristics that arehard to find that get compensated evenmore so and certain you know ethnicitiesDoctorate Degrees and things like thatwhere somebody can really pay for theireducation by donating theireggs it's a it's a dilemma because whatyou'd love to say is like freeze someeggs for you too if you're going to dothat you're at the perfect age to freezeyour own eggs and there's beenstrategies to try to mitigate this and Idon't want to get off too much on atangent but it's a really fine line thatyou walk with what people understand sothere is a company and I won't name thembut they are promoting that young womendonate their eggs and they will freezehalf of them for you and half of themwill go and become donor eggs nowinteresting business model but I couldsee the potential ethical concerns so Ithink ethically this sounds good becauseyou get to freeze some eggs but I thinkmore people will donate eggs thanotherwise would have for some of thereasons we previously stated and I alsothink you would get more money by simplydonating your eggs and then turningaround and paying for a round offreezing your own eggs you would getpaid more and you'd have more eggsbecause one of the issues is do do younow falsely believe that you enough eggsin the bank because you did this splitbut you don't really have enough becausewe already walked through the math at 20eggs doesn't really result in such ahigh probability of having a multi-childfamily so you know there's a lot ofethical debate in gam an embryo donationit definitely is the wild west andthere's a UnchartedTerritory even an embryo donationthere's places who are very unethicalabout it who willonly allow people to have embryos ifthey are heterosexual been married for 3years make a certain income submit to ahome study yet they let the people haveno say over the embryos that aretransferred be it how many what stagewhat quality and they are takingpeople's money and putting terribleembryos inside

you knowwe've had discussions about this on thispodcast before but but a lot of peopleare wondering just to be to be direct alot of people are wondering do more IVFbabies have autism um than non-ivfbabies is this a good question and it'schanged over time in a couple differentways and I think this is important tounderstand so if we just think about thehormonal environment with naturalconception and you know you have a peakestrogen let's say of 200 something youhave progesterone being made theplacenta is implanting and what is themain difference with IVF babies and alot of it has been tied back to theuterine environment especially in whatwe call Fresh embryo transfers which isreally not a common practice anymoreso in a fresh Embryo transfer I'm goingto take the eggs out of your bodyfertilize them in the lab and grow outembryos and then I'm going to put thebest embryo back in your body 5 dayslater at the natural time ofimplantation and if we rewind the clockthat's how IVF was done right when youcouldn't freeze embryos very well andthey didn't survive and You' put lots ofembryos inside because they wouldn'tsurvive and that's the early days of IVFwhen you saw a lot of multiples a lot ofhigh order multiples and of coursemultiples have their own distinct issuesthat put them at higher risk fordevelopmental disorders and issues withdevelopment and birth RIS in generalright they're they're common to be fairthey're commonly referred to as asdisorders I just think um around autismin particular there is there's a camp agrowing camp out there that um want wantit referred to differently we we'vecovered this uh anytime this comes up Ibring up both just to highlight the factthat yes we are aware and sensitive tothat emerging issue right now onunfortunately for sake of conversationthere's no new nomenclature so we couldeasily get um caught down in in the inthe attempt to try and like you know umsmooth over everything with everybodyand and it and as a consequence confuseeverybody so I think we'll go forclarity forward with the understandingthat the nomenclature is changing can'teven say alcoholism anymore because it'salcohol use disorder and I don't have aproblem with that but a lot of peoplewonder if those are two different thingsit's just confusing and we want tosimplify science for people exactly sofeel free so when we first doing IVFwe're putting embryos back in anextremely unnatural environment if youhave 20 eggs growing and each egg makes200grams of estrogen suddenly now youhave these extremely high superphysiologic estrogen levels higherprogesterone levels because there's moreCorpus ludum and this environment is notthe normal for how the placenta wouldinvade into that maternal blood circulatand a lot of these issues that arecommonly associated became so because ofplacental issues so a lot of things likegrowth restriction small for gestationalage pre-term birth which further putsyou at risk for other developmentaldisorders were associated with thesefresh transfers the field has changed wedo a lot of frozen embryo transfers anda lot of it for this reason we see hugeImprovement in neonatal outcomes whenyou bleed off that high hormonal uterineenvironment and then regrow the liningof the uterus and a hormonal levelthat's more natural and then transferthe embryo and we see completelydifferent fetal outcomes so that'sfantastic as far as looking at thechange over the field but of course ifyou take all IVF babies over all timeit's a little murky because you havemodern practice and old practice we alsoknow thatinfertility people if you get diagnosedwith infertility so you're under age 35and you try to get pregnant with regularperiods for one year and have not hadsuccess U or you're 35 and older andyou've tried for 6 months and you've nothad success you meet the medicaldefinition forinfertility when thathappens you now statistically regardlessif you get pregnant naturally in thenext month or you do IVF you have a 1%higher chance of birth effects and youhave a slightly higher chance ofDevelopmental disorders so is it morepopulationbased versus procedure basedand there's probably something to thatto underlying a lot of potentially whatgoes in or what can cause infertilitywhen it comes to you know quality ofeggs or sperm or uterine environment orthings that we're still learning aboutwhen it comes to autism specifically thenumber one strongest Association we haveis Advanced paternal age so when youlook at the people and the male spermcomes from an ejaculation after age 50that one does have the highestsignificance associated with autism andalso with some other very interestingautismal dominant disorders so we don'twant to take Advanced paternal agelikely although it does get so much lessattention than what we call Advancedmaternal age or being over age 35 in awoman and that is purely because of thedifferences in the sperm and the Eggenvironment and how their quality isimpactful thank you for that answer Ithink um it's really important forpeople to hear that uh because you knowthe the lore out there is that IVFhigher incidents of of autism and IVFbabies but it sounds like a goodpercentage of those um could be becauseof age- related factors um as well astechnology related factors that um andthat the technology is getting betterall the time um if I understoodcorrectly uh

neglected tobring this up earlier and I know there'sa lot of curiosity about this and thenwe'll and then we'll uh finish off IVFcan we do that sort of a pause in theIVF so the eggs are out they're frozensperm's out it's frozen or maybe they'regoing to put um live sperm on anon-frozen excuse me uh sperm directlyonto those unfrozen eggs we'll pausethere intermission for those umpotentialembryos um and talk about something thatyou've been um very open about which isum and a lot of people are not franklyin your profession so I reallyappreciate this which is nutrition andsupplementation to optimize the thehealth of uh egg quality and and notjust for people who want to get pregnantbut for but for people who believe thatfertility is a proxy for overall healthso I mean are there things that peopleshould eat and not eat um things thatpeople should supplement and notsupplement in order to um optimize theirfertility I mean this is definitely aninterest of mine right all my fellowshipresearch Cycles around fundability andnatural fertility and I think we reallydo a disservice by how medicine reallyis categorized by organ systems becausewe act like things in one place don'timpact the other as if right but it'syou have a body and your body andespecially your hormones change andfluctuate and they're meant to they aremeant to be a dynamic system but theworld and the environment of which youare injecting your body to has provenchanges on both hormonal function andalso when it comes to egg and spermquality and so if you are somebody whojust wants to live your healthiest lifeand have your most regular periods andhave your hormones as well balanced asthey can be for a lack of a better wordwe'll just say that that means thatthey're functioning normally then payingattention to the things that you do arereally important and so I know this is abig one for you sleep is probably thenumber one thing that people don't dothat does impact their reproductivehormone system and therefore can impactegg and sperm quality because sleep iswhen you have cellular repair and whenyou can drop your inflammation levels weknow that inflammation is just toxic toeggs and sperm it is the inflammatoryenvironment is not ideal for conceptionand then for a female you have to dealwith the fact that you have your eggquality but you also have howinflammation or what you're exposed toimpacts your an environment so you havea twofold situation here so none of thisshould be shocking news when it comes tonutrition but it is not talked aboutenough you're right decreasinginflammation by the foods that we put inour body is consistently shown with animprovement in fundability animprovement in ovulation and animprovement in success with IVF and adecrease in miscarriage right hugeStudies have looked at these now the Viccaveat is that nutrition studies aresuper hard because people who consumeflax for example tend to have other goodhealth behaviors that sometimes make ithard to identify what flax did versustheir General Health versus somebody whoeats fast food every day so nutritionstudies tend to be observational andFertility Studies are really hard toobecause what inpoint are you using is itgetting pregnant is it live birth areyou looking at IVF are you looking atnatural fertility and we have a lot ofdifferent overlap that makes both ofthese a little bit difficult and sothey're all cohort-based orpopulationbased studies where youanalyze how people perform when it comesto fertility treatments or gettingpregnant naturally based on theirexposures to certainthings diets highend fruits andvegetables are good for you right fiberantioxidants fruit is not bad fruit gotthis really bad reputation really I lovefruit I love fruit too but people thinkthat it has sugar and that it's bad foryou it has fructose but but no it's notthat type of sugar is not bad for you ifwe can just agree on the fact that fruithas a lot of nutritional benefitespecially when it comes to vitamins andantioxidants that can be extremelybeneficial in decreasinginflammation grains so whole grainsespecially that your body you knowprovide a lot of great fiber so ofcourse if you have Celiac or you'regluten intolerant you're a differentcategory but there was so much focus onketo and people eliminating brains as afood group overall and even though thatmight be utilized in a dietary strategyto lose weight and losing weight canimprovefertility likely because of inflammationbeing the primary driver because we knowthat even in studies where I take donoreggs and I transfer that embryo intosomebody who's overweight they havelower odds of success than if they werea normal BMI so we can't act like thatcausation is just on egg quality fromobesity right there's also someinflammation some inflammatory changesthat impact the body's ability or desireto allow an embryo to implantso fruits veggies whole grains are allgood interestingly you know dairy dairytends to be okay in most studies butwhat we do see is that if you're goingto have dairy have whole have the realthing the processed Dairy the skim milkthat actually increases your fertilityand likely because the processing tomake it still look like milk when youtake out the fat is adding in thingsthat are unnatural potentially impactingyour fertility I don't drink milkanymore but when I was a teenager Idrank half and half I'm not recommendinganyone do that remember I was a skinnyteenager I was you were trying to bul upwell no I just could afford to I wasn'ttrying at that age I wasn't trying to atall but um it was just delicious um butso cheeses um whole uh full fat milkyogurt half and half yogurt okay yeahbut don't don't choose the skim onechoose the actual one that comes withsome of the milk fat fat is not bad foryou there's also this right hopefullywe're getting away from it but there'sbeen such a lowfat craze or this realattention that fat is so bad but fatcomes in so many importantforms avocados and oils and nuts Dairymeat fat and cholesterol are thebackbone for all hormones right so youneed that in order for your body to makethe estrogen and progesterone that itneeds to allow this whole process tohappen and so there's this idea thatthose are bad for you that's just reallynot so healthy fats whole grains fruitsveggies and what about proteins andmeats because I think within those"

through the meatsand the myth and the fact so we'll dotofu so there's this big issue that liketofu has soy and that too much soy canbe bad because soy can be aphytoestrogen tofu does not negativelyimpact fertility even in Men In fact itcan improve it because it does have someantioxidant like properties lots of ironwhen it comes to fish fish are fantasticsources of healthy fats and omega-3fatty acids which are very crucial inthe reproductive process we do worryabout if you're pregnant having too muchfish and overexposure to Mercury and howthat can impact fetal brain developmentso the general recommendation is threeservings per week that doesn't let meguess a serving is like four to sixounces as opposed to like a real humanthat eats you know a real human yeahthats yeah that eats you know you knowsix to eight ounces of fish right and Ithink it's important to say even thoughpeople will tell you that when you'retrying to get pregnant with the idea ofwe don't know when you're going to bepregnant if you're going through thingslike egg freezing or IVF and you knowwhen you're going to be pregnant Iwouldn't feel like you have to restrictyourself on the consumption of seafoodduring those time periods when you knowyou're not pregnant yet because reallythe concern is about that mercury andwhat it could potentially do to a fetalbrain and raw seafood correct no sushino Sashimi well when you're pregnantcorrect and that's mostly because of therisk of infectious disease that cancause you know severe brain developmentand other issues what do they do inJapan I don't know I don't live therethey probably laugh at this theyprobably do laugh at us probably dolaugh at us someone who's who's um uhbeen pregnant in Japan yeah reach outtell us yeah or conceived in Japan tellus don't tell us the story of theconception like but tell us tell us ohdid you haveSashimi overall meat is a really broadcategory and studies study itdifferently like is it all meat are youdistinguishing out red meat and chickenare you putting it all together I meanobviously I think we can all come to theagreement that processed meats are notgood for for a variety of differentreasons in addition to beingcarcinogenic those toxins do negativelyimpact fertility now so deli meat nobueno so yeah but and specifically thosethings like the bacon and the pro likethe things that are really highly proyhot dogs sorry the Fourth of July hotdog picnic but those things really donot provide nutritional advantages andonly harm especially then when we havered meat for the most part red meat whenisolated individually in mostcircumstances in moderation tends to befine I usually tell my patients I wantthem to eat a plant forward diet butthat doesn't mean no meat but I say lookat your meat servings I don't want itred meat every single day because therewas a study looking at IVF and lookingat embryos and the more servings a lotof nutritional studies base things oncortile so who eats the lowest and thesecond most and the third most thetopmost and people who ate in that topcortile of red meat had lowerprogression of embryos through theculture so less embryos that developedless normal embryos and lower successrates and do we know anything about thehow that meat was arriving are wetalking like like hogy sandwiches or arewe talking about like grass-fed steaksright the studies are not wonderful butthat doesn't mean that they don't holdMerit and helping us guide counselingbut no that one was how many servings ofred meat do you eat in a week right sowe don't really know does the reallyethically sourced the grass-fed you knowthis environment which we feel like ismuch less toxic than potentially let'ssay like a cattle Factory where the cowsare injected with all sorts of things isthere a difference and how those impactyourreproduction probably right if thiscow's getting injected with a lot ofhormones why are we thinking that it'snot impacting the meat that you're theningesting into your body no I think ouraudience will certainly um subscribe tothat uh idea I think most of them will Imean the notion that like the pollutantsyou breathe in the air somehow are notthe the air that you breathe into yourlungs is is just likecompletely and the idea people feel thatway and they hold strongly to this ideathat it can't be this thing that I lovethat is causing this problem right thedenial of the association between whatwe put in and on our body and how itimpacts our body's function is reallystrong in some people and I think it'sreallyjust lack of education and awarenessbecause the medical community for solong did not address these factors rightyour doctor never talked to to you aboutnutrition and so it just became thisidea that it must not matter otherwiseyour doctor would talk to you about it Ithink sugar is the last thing I justdidn't mention but added sugar andartificial sugars are bad for youartificial sugars artifici icial sugarstoo so including Stevia s of plant-basedart low calorie sweeteners Stevia itselfhasn't been studied as much as the otherones things like sweet and low all ofthose MH but what we do know is thatthey interfere they cause inflammationinside the body and then they also causecan cause a stress reaction and they cancause higher rates of miscarriage whenyou intake more sugar and artificialsugar so that's a lot to wrap your headaround and I say this same thing toeverypatient one cake one this one hot dog Imean those things individually are notgoing to make a difference right it'sthe choices that you make every singleday that are going to set you up to beyour Healthy self or not and so youshould make choices in line with how youwant to treat yourself you want to be inyour best health you want your hormonesfunctioning the best and if that addedhelps you get pregnant when you want tohelps you have a better chance ofsuccess with IVF oh my gosh what afantastic benefit but that doesn't meanyou can't enjoy some of these bad thingshere and there as long as you've setyourself up on the dayto day whereyou're giving your body lots ofnutritious food that it needs to makehormones similarly being you know veryunderweight and calorie restricting weall know is really terrible for yourreproductive system and can cause thebrain to totally shut down ovulationbecause it senses that you can't have apregnancy people miss carry excuse mefor um by virtue of being underweightdoes the body like like I learned umsome years ago I think this is stilltrue that one of the signals for theonset of puberty in females is thatleptin um hormone is secreted from bodyfat yeah um that then signals to thebrain to the hypothalamus like okay it'syou know there's enough reserves tocreate uh environmental it's a signalabout environmental um yeah there'senough extra fat to have a baby yeah andthere's presumably enough food around uhto sustain that baby right aremiscarriages and lack of body fatcorrelated on both ends of the spectrumyes right so lack of body fat and beingoverweight we see decrease in gettingpregnant per month and we see increasein losing pregnancies so certainly thereis a healthy medium where your body haswhat it needs and that makes sensebecause if you have I like to even sayhypothalamic dysfunction so maybe yourbrain's not to toally shut off whereit's sending out no hormones and you'renot ovulating because you're not gettingpregnant in that circumstance butcertainly ovulation disorders are on aspectrum where you go from a perfectlysynchronized cycle to one that prolongsit you know gets shorter together thenprolongs and then you have nothingthere's this spectrum of dysfunctionwhich is representing your hormones notbeing necessarily perfect and that canhave impacts on the placenta trying togrow into that uterus I mean theplacenta is fascinating right right anentire talk just on the placenta but ithas it does this incredible job whereyour body has to not reject it yet allowit to eat away at the side of youruterus and grow into your blood vesselsbut that requires a very specifichormonal environment for it to be doneand to be done right I think in the samebreath of all this what you're alsoasking is yeah okay so that's eatinghealthy none of that's really new newsfor most people a lot of those things Ijust said well I think so but I do wantto thank you because I think um rarelyif ever do we hear somebody so aphysician be really direct about likeHey listen some red meat yes notexcessive amounts of red meat ideallyfrom uh sustainable sources whole fatmilk products grains fruits vegetables Imean those kind of um straight what liketo you seem like straightforwarddirectives are are actually pretty rarein in the landscape of of Public Healthdiscussion because um more often thannot people talk about nutrition andthese kind of Elimination Diet typethings like you know eliminate all thegrains or eliminate all the meat or umyou know eliminate all the milk milkfats when in reality I think peopleforget that like most people out thereare omnivores and they can make betterchoices about not deli meat you knowless bacon if any bacon right have someveggies with your lunch right like youcan make better choices on theday-to-day I think that that is a greatpoint I think there's a place forsupplements I think the big disclaimerthat everybody's going to say withsupplements is that they are notregulated like the way medications areright and I will say supplements andherbs are different things right asupplement but many companies are addingherbs to their supplements and that canget into really murky territoryespecially when it comes to how some ofthese herbs do have estrogen andprogestin like properties and can impactreproduction and hormones and perhapseven androgenic properties too so wecan't act like everything's createdequal so I always tell people if Irecommend you take a supplement or your"

that hatethose twitchers right um and so okaythey're going to wash the the sperm whybecause yeah most of what people see asejaculate or know excuse me as ejaculateis um is not actually the sperm rightokay so but sperm are washed they're inone compartment um you get the eggs outyou you or your embryologist at yourclinic is then going to at some pointdecide to combine them so is it kind ofis it a sperm race or are you um maybeyou could explain ixie and and why wouldone want why would one up for ixie andis are there any risks with ixie becausethere you're really at some level thisis the only place where I kind of sitback and okay is somebody you you knowSt neural development like some levelyou're saying hey that sperm looks goodwhereas when you run a sperm race natureis saying hey this sperm really did beatall the other sperm so let's segue firstbecause I think this is nice because thequestion I get asked all the time whenwe talk about nutrition and supplementsand all of that is to now you're doingIVF or you're freezing your eggand what if what behaviors are good orbad of course all of those same ones arebut about how long do you need to dothem and this is why if you live healthymost of the days it doesn't reallymatter because that's how you're livingbut we already know the sperm cycle isabout 90 days and the eggs I like to sayeven though they're in the vault theybecome they start lining up gettingready to exit the Vault and become moresusceptible to the things you're doingin that 90-day window and we know thatto be true as well so they start to bepre- ected for who's coming out the nextmonth they start to line up and somaking these changes as you startthinking about getting pregnant doingfertility treatments is still extremelybeneficial people will often say well Ihaven't been doing that so why start nowit's not going to make a difference buttruly it can or I'll drink up until theweek until the day up I'll just I'lljust get it in people like I'm going tohave my two glasses of wine whichactually equates to about six glasses ofwine when you measure out by how much bythe volume right right up until the weekbefore getting pregnant or somethinglike that but no so so people always askwhat should I be doing is these healthybehaviors and you should be doing themyou know this whole time when we do IVFand I'm going to get all the things youjust asked but earlier you said well howtolerable is it the truth is you'retaking shots these are subcutaneousshots during the egg growth process soso next to the belly button yeah next tothe belly button like how a diabeticgives insulin a very small needle I meannobody loves shots but they're not a bigintramuscular shot it's not like a flushot or something like that listen I'vebeen to Austin the Texan mosquitoesworse they hurt way worse than one ofthese needles exactly so you're going touse those medications for about 12 to 14days you're going to have your folliclesgrow you're going to feel that so you'regoing to have pelvic pressure as yourestrogen Rises you're also going tothird space your fluid which means yourfluid your water component of your bloodis going to start to just eek out alittle bit and you're gonna get morebloated you're gonna have more waterweight you're going to feel puffier andthat is very common just because ofgetting the eggs to grow you're going tomentally be fine because the femalebrain loves high estrogen so you'redoing fine as and that's one of the mainconcerns is how emotional will I be andduring this phase of the process peopledo great when we take the eggs out ofthe body it's about a 20 minuteprocedure it is usually done under IVsedation like propal and Fentanyl and weare watching while we drain thosefollicles and get test tubes full of theeggs do some people often not use any umsay I hear the word Fentanyl and I'msure a lot of people are like waitfentanyl crisis and I you know obviouslyfentanyl is a drug that has its uses umvalid uses in the um medical communityum does anyone just kind of opt for youknow just I mean we have ananesthesiologist who is really talkingto the patients I mean propile is thebase of it certainly there's somepatients who may want to avoid narcoticusage and they use different strategiesI mean there was this huge right theretrievals podcast came out from likethe New York Times doing a deep diveinto a fertility clinic Yale where anurse was siphoning off fenel for forherself and replacing it with sailingand giving patients saline these thisClinic did not do anesthesia basedpropofol so they were supposed to justget fentel and have kind of a less painenvironment not a no pain environmentand not not just a few hundreds of womenreported extreme pain extreme painthrough the procedure really speakslargely to pain not being takenseriously when they went and found thisout who what happened to I can't helpbut ask what happened to this uhtechnician well I mean yeah they'rethey're they're trying to find fentelBehind Bars yeah I mean and but it'shuge as far as to like I mean I can'timagine I can't imagine doing I do thisprocedure like all the time right I'vedone thousands and thousands in mycareer and I can't imagine having peoplebe in pain during it so it's but it'simportant to know that some clinicsdon't use IV sedation or they don't usepropol they don't put you to sleepunderstanding what your clinic is usingis really really important to set theexpectations or to know am I going to beawake or am I going to be asleep can apatient ask you know what specific drugsare you going to give me to kill painfor sure and I mean some clinics only doone like I am not going to do aretrieval under no sedation now someclinics would allow that some clinicsthat's all that they do but you that's ahuge piece of the puzzle that you needto know if you're a patient are yougoing to be feeling pain not feelingpain what's it going to be like I'll saymost clinics use propol and put patientsto sleep and so you take a nice littlenap for 15 to 20 minutes the eggs areretrieved from the follicles underdirect visualization they're in testtubes you wake up and you're going tofeelcrampy and you'll get a period 10ishdays later but this is when you'll feelyour worse and this is just the onething I want to say about tolerabilityof it can you get pregnant in that timeyeah yeah yeah and there's a a casereport of an egg donor who was donatingher eggs and she had sex with herboyfriend and because not every egg isalways retrieved from the fices or somesmall ones could ovulate too and she gotpregnant with quintuplets whoa okay soyou have to really tell people not tohave intercourse one from an infectiousstandpoint because we really are pokingyou know a pretty large gauge needlethrough the vaginal mucosa into theperinal cavity so we don't want tointroduce infection but also forpregnancy in that time period And if yougot pregnant your risk of what we callovarian hypers stimulation syndrome orohss is very profound so what isnormally happening is after theretrieval your estrogen and progesteroneare going to drop you're going to feel asevere PMS for lack of a better word sowhen you'll be more emotional you'restill pretty bloated until this allheals if you get ohsswhich is very uncommon in modernpractice but when you did fresh embryotransfers or people who don't utilizesome of the modern protocols this meansthat HCG continues to encourage allthose follicles to make estrogen andprogesterone and if you are pregnantyou're just going to have a constant yetexponential increase in HCG and so thisis going to get worse and worse so wereally don't want people to get pregnantin that time period so when during thattime period should they avoid sex so isit in the few days before the extractionso typically I usually say it's fromlike day five of your stimulation okayso usually the earliest egg retrievalsare kind of around cycle day N9 or 10 ifsomebody goes fast until your nextperiod comes so that's usually about athree week time period where we want youto abstain fromintercourse so for the most part thoughthe more eggs you have the more you'regoing to feel both both this hormonaland physical shift than the fewer eggsthat you have so if you have a low eggcount and you need to do IVF or freezeyour eggs and you might do multipleCycles or rounds you're going totolerate it actually pretty fine becauseyou're not going to have these hugeshifts physically you're going to feelfine and that's always a big concernwhen you mentioned earlier aboutdifferent stimulationtypes people have this idea that thingsthat are more natural are better rightjust like this human thought thatnatural is good and synthetic is badnaturally you ovulate one egg a monthwhen we're trying to get eggs out ofyour body the success is determined byhow many eggs I can get and how youngyou are so it doesn't make sense in mostcircumstances to do a minimalstimulation protocol meaningpurposefully under stimulating Somebodyby saving the money and medication costin order to purposely get fewer eggsbecause their odds of getting theultimate success of what they want isgoing to be so much lower is there Idon't want you to be in the position ofI don't want to put you rather in theposition of kind of like having todemonize your your colleagues in yourprofession but I could see how there's apretty significant financial incentivefor people who are really desperate tohave children or who just simply mightwant to have children down the road toum they hear low stem is better we'retalking multiple low stem Cycles theymight be um even fraction of the cost ofa full stem cycle but then there manymany more low stem Cycles you got it youcan make a lot more money by doingthings that are not in the best interestof the patient and I mean that's notuncommon in my field which is very sadbut it does mean that becausereproduction and IVF are so foreign andunknown so many people walk in blind notknowing if what they're being toldreally makes sense for their situationthere are a couple situations whereminimal stimulation makes sense ifyou're only going to make three eggsyou're only going to make three eggs Idon't need all the drugs in the world totell your body to make three eggs cuzthere's only three and so that is ascenario where minimal stimulation doesmake sense and then there's the scenariowhere there's something called invos"

don'tovulate like your very refractory PCOSpatient who doesn't respond tomedication or who have tubal Factorinfertility right so your fallopiantubes are blocked because of chlamidiaorendometriosis and we just have a problemhere that egg and sperm can't gettogether because you're not ovulating oryour tubes are blocked an invocell it'sadevice that is plastic and you can fitup to 10 eggs in it and there's a littleMiddle Chamber where the sperm can goand so you go through this IVF processwith the goal to only get 8 to 10 eggsbecause that's what fits in the deviceand then you put the sperm in the middleof it and then you put it inside yourvagina and you hold it in place with adiaphragm and the vagina is the righttemperature to incubate and so youincubate your embryos in this littleinvocell container inside your vaginaand then 5 days later you come in and wetake it out and we take the best embryoand we transfer it and you can do afresh transfer because you didn't makeso many eggs so your hormones weren't sohigh do people like this procedurethere's something that seems like yeahlike staying in proximity to the spermand egg like you're Tak you're taking ithome okay so I love this procedure insome some circumstances and I see itapplied often in the wrong case and thatthat can be frustrating right becauseit's still not cheap even if it'scheaper than IVF it is still notinexpensive in any means and so patientselection like most things in this fieldare so important so let's just say ifyou've had no like if sperm if thesperm's the problem then it's probablynot smart to just presume that the spermand egg will be fine in there right likethat might be a case where you really doneed help with assisted fertilization orif you have unexplained infertility ifwe don't know why you haven't been ableto get pregnant because everything looksgood on paper what if fertilization isthe issue and these are circumstanceswhere you pull out an invos cell andthere's no embryos and you don't reallyknow where when wrong was it thefertilization step was it the growthstep of the embryos and culture so youdo have less data notably I like datayou can't do genetic testing and thisisn't really a strategy that allows youto freeze embryos for future familygrowth that being said the young patientwho's got great egg quality who mighthave really bad PCOS or tubal disease itcan certainly allow them the opportunityfor a child at a lower price point whenthey still have many reproductive yearsto finalize their family it also is alovely option for people who need donorsperm to conceive because the successrates with this are so much higher thanan IUI which is what a lot of people usean intrauterine insemination or puttingthe sperm in the uterus so now we'reable to improve this outcome so like oursame-sex couples or our single parentsby choice if it's a single woman who'strying to become a parent then they needto buy donor sperm and go through theprocess anyway this often can improvethat efficacy through the processpending their age and other factorsthere was a study that was just reallyneat there's a lesbian couple and one ofthem the eggs came out of and the otherone incubated the embryos and then theother one had the embryo transfers sobut it gave both Partners a way to feela little more involved in the processwhich I just think is always a reallycool way when you have these differentoptions with reproduction seems also soum that it's a more of athree-dimensional environment like Ialways imagine that the petri dish isapproach um is so two-dimensionalcompared to the body and all thesethings having done cell culture beforeand you know cultured neurons and thingsof that sort like there's all theseconcerns about like the concentration ofCO2 in the thing or you know you knowGod forbid if there's a a fluctuation inyou you have backup generators andthings but in the electrical flow to theincubators that's disruptive whereas thethe natural environment of the body eventhough it fluctuates in temperature it'sI mean this has evolved over you knowtens of thousands if not you knowhundreds of thousands of years to be theprocess by which embryos are created sothere seem so here's where I sort ofdefault in my mind anyway uh to the kindof like oh like it seems more naturalyou're incubating in the more quoteunquote more natural environment but atthe samebreath wh why are you having infertilityif you're an infertility patient rightso if you need donor sperm you maybedon't have infertility or if you havetubal disease you have a very definedreason and why we don't think thatthere's this huge inflammatory issue inyour body or something unknown so againI'll see it applied to people who reallyare bad candidates for it based on theirage or based on their diagnosis and soit's not always better but for the rightpatient I mean I've had patients havebabies that way who otherwise may not beable to so it can it can really open upthe doors so that's the most minimal ofthe minimal stimulation right then wehave minimal stimulation because you"

theeggs come into the lab if you have eggfreezing very important to know isbefore we get into the iie discussionthe eggs are stripped of their outercells which is called the cumulus that'swhat the sperm has to attach to in orderto fertilize in order to freeze the eggsthe cumula cells are stripped off theeggs are frozen you have to do ixie soif we're going to lead into this ixieconversation if you're freezing youreggs you're having ixie when youfertilize them so I don't want somebodyto ever not know that if that is whatthey are choosing and iie is you cantell us yes iie stands for it's icsi orintracytoplasmic sperm injection it istaking a sperm that under the microscopelooks normal in shape and moves well andyou're pulling it up into a littleneedle and you're essentially using alittle laser on the side of the egg orthe zon of palu of the egg and you'reinjecting that one sperm into that eggcytoplasm and you're picking that spermon the basis of shape motility you'repicking what you think is is the bestsperm in the batch obviously yeah you'repicking I mean there's going to be onesperm per egg so there's m multiplesperm that are chosen but you're pickingsperm that look like they have thehighest potential and my understandingis that there's a range from very low topotentially high but hopefully not highof DNA fragmentation in pretty muchevery cell of the body like the cell isalways repairing its DNA so whenvisually selecting a sperm uh for forixie it's it's based on morphology shapeand motility right you can't see the DNAdamage inside the head of the sperm orthe DNA itself are we are we soon tohave a technology where you couldactually um like get a do that couldlabel DNA fragmentation and and selectum because I feel like so like when wetalk about embryology not to get too fardown in the weeds but um like the themethods of selecting eggs and selectingsperm I mean these are the same methodsthat have been used in embryology forlike since the 1930s like oh this onelooks good that one looks good and theskilled embryologist can can reallydevelop a a real talent at over time oflike knowing what correlated withhealthy pregnancy and and an offspringbut I do like technology you would thinkthat by now 2023 that someone would havesome diey that you could drop on thesperm and go well like that one has alot of DNA fragmentation and that onedoesn't know right there should bebetter ways to choose which spermthere's definitely people are tryingthings nothing has proven to be helpfulso far there's definitely some interestin this because we're starting to getmore insight as we have become better atembryo culture getting embryos to growdoing genetic testing on embryos tounderstand that that male genome kicksin at day three and there's a upset ofpeople who have beautiful fertilizationand embryo growth days0 to three andthat's all on the egg and then as soonas that male genome kicks in you havethis huge drop off in your embryo numberand even some of this is in the contextof normal sperm parameters right sothings aren't really normal though orthere's something underlying it and doesthat mean that every embryo failure onday three post fertilization is no ofcourse not but it definitely means thatnone of the ones before that can beblamed on the sperm and ones after thatthere's definitely still maternal andsperm contributions and we don't want tocreate any um you know a couple uhdisputes around this um but it can be anInsight when you're trying to lookthrough somebody's IVF cycle aboutpotentially modifiable factors right canyou improve sperm quality by some ofthese lifestyle measures I mean thedebatable thing about a DNA spermfragmentation so what is that it is nota normal semen analysis but it is likethat as far as it's a sperm sample thatis then sent off to be evaluated howmuch fragmentation or abnormal DNA is inthe heads of those sperm the Studieshave shown that people who have abnormalDNA sperm fragmentation should do ixieokay that's like the point of the studynow ixie become very common place soixie choosing the sperm to put into theegg originally didn't exist right sowhat's thealternative conventional fertilizationthis is having your petri dish your eggsare on it you squirt your sperm youcover it up you put it in the incubatorshe didn't mean you squirt your spermshe me she meant the tech theembryologist embryologist squirts thesperm on top be clear just to be clearand then pulls it out and the next daysees by which eggs and spermfertilized well it's really devastatingto pull out the dish and have nofertilization and it definitely is acause of infertility and it can be veryhard to know that because fertilizationis not challenged on a cellular leveluntil you challenge it so ixie used tobe an add-on cost it used to be aseparate thing because it was harder tofind embryologists who could do it it'sso standard that a lot of clinics do itthe majority of the time purely becauseyou often don't know all the variablesthat are impacting fertilization andyou're trying to give somebody as manyopportunities aspossible ixie has in a lot of thoseoriginal IVF studies got some of the badreputation of being the problem with whyyou might see that 1% rise of birtheffects and so ixie took the brunt froma lot of that we really don't see thatwhen we're growing out and we're doingfreezing the embryos doing Frozentransfers and I was I mean I do I inalmost every patient I'm not going tosay in everyone higher probability ofsuccess probability success and when youget to this point and so few people haveinsurance coverage so they're spendingtheir money they're getting secondmortgages they're taking out loans ifthere's one decision that you say well Idon't know you could have zero eggsfertilized or I could have theembryologist pick the best sperm and putthem inside the egg and we expect a 75%chance of fertilization that makes sensefor the majority of people yeah thatthat that makes sense to me I um becauseI'm obsessed with data on you know doblood work fairly regularly not notobsessively but fair you know twice yearso um now I didn't always do that and Iactually did one of these um DNAfragmentation tests that they're prettyexpensive you know they're in the theyare more than a Sean analysis yeahthey're they're in the you know low yeahthey're sort of $1,200 $1,500 or so atleast the one that I did it was veryinformative like it was reliev to seenot abnormal levels of DNA fragmentationbut I will say that based on everythingyou just said it seems like it might bethe lower cost option because you knowthe alternative is to go throughrepeated cycles of IVF and it's failingand that's certainly much more expensiveit is and I mean I will say that thereis some current thought by my Urologycolleagues right so I am not a urologistbut definitely when I have a male whoyou know needs a sperm extraction maybehe's had a prior bomy maybe he's gotvery low sperm counts and we're goingand we're doing a sperm extractionprocedure that potentially if you have apatient who has an abnormal DNA spermfragmentation and even with ixie hasthis drop off in embryo growth after daythree because the sperm are still beingmade the same way right are they stillfragmented that potentially theejaculatory process could cause some ofthat fragmentation in certain men and bygoing in and doing a sperm extractionand not subjecting those sperm to therigors of ejaculation for lack of abetter word couldpotentially lessen the fragmentation andimprove outcomes and I have somepatients who we've gone down that roadand that has helped them clear to saythere's not a study that it's not thepoint of DNA sperm frag is to try todistinguish if potentially ixie could bea helpful technology but a lot ofdoctors are offering or doing ixiebecause we want you to fertilize youreggs when they grow out in culture as wetalked about ibf changing the metabolicneeds of the embryo you know changethroughout the process and so embryoculture has become so much moresuccessful but even in those best casescenarios we're looking at 50%progression so you're going to have lossthrough throughout that culture processno matter what and you said 50%progression so half of the fertilized"

We discuss female hormones, nutrition, supplementation, reproductive health, and fertility, including how the timing and duration of puberty impact a woman\u2019s long-term hormone cycles and menopause. We also discuss the pros and cons of various birth control methods and how hormonal vs. non-hormonal birth control each affects fertility. We cover the factors that impact egg and sperm quality and how to leverage timing for conception. We also discuss procedures to assess female fertility, including egg count and hormone testing, the process of egg freezing, in vitro fertilization (IVF) and other reproductive options. This episode represents fairly comprehensive coverage of female hormones and reproductive health, highlighting important tests and screening, behavioral, nutritional, supplement and prescription-based tools that women of any age can use to improve their fertility, hormone function and overall health.\u00a0\nFor the full show notes, please visit hubermanlab.com.\nThank you to our sponsors\nAG1: https://drinkag1.com/huberman\nMaui Nui:\u00a0https://mauinuivenison.com/huberman\nHelix Sleep:\u00a0https://helixsleep.com/huberman\nInsideTracker:\u00a0https://insidetracker.com/huberman\nMomentous: https://www.livemomentous.com/huberman"
