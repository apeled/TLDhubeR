sciencerelated tools to the general public inkeeping with that theme I'd like tothank the sponsors of today's podcastour first sponsor is eight sleep eightsleep makes Smart mattress covers withcooling Heating and sleep trackingcapacity I've spoken many times beforein this podcast about the fact thatsleep is the foundation of mental healthphysical health and performance now akey component of getting a great night'ssleep is that in order to fall and staydeeply asleep your body temperatureactually has to drop by about one to 3\u00b0and in order to wake up feelingrefreshed and energized your bodytemperature actually has to increase byabout 1 to 3\u00b0 one of the best ways tomake sure that those temperature changesoccur at the appropriate times at thebeginning and throughout and at the endof your night when you wake up is tocontrol the temperature of your sleepingenvironment and that's what eight sleepallows you to do it allows you toprogram the temperature of your mattressand sleeping environment such that youfall and stay deeply asleep easily andwake up each morning feeling incrediblyrefreshed and energized I've beensleeping on an eights Sleep mattresscover for almost 3 years now and it hasdramatically improved the quality of mysleep so much so that when I travel andI'm at a hotel or an Airbnb and I don'thave access to my eight sleep I verymuch look forward to getting homebecause my sleep is always better when Isleep on my eight Sleep mattress coverif you'd like to try eights sleep youcan go to 8sleep.comhuberman to get $50 off their pod 3mattress cover

that has everythingyou need and nothing you don't thatmeans zero sugar and the appropriateratios of the electrolyte sodiummagnesium and potassium and that correctratio of electrolytes is extremelyimportant because every cell in yourbody but especially your nerve cellsyour ner neurons relies on electrolytesin order to function properly so whenyou're well hydrated and you have theappropriate amount of electrolytes inyour system your mental functioning andyour physical functioning is improved Idrink one packet of element dissolved inabout 16 to 32 ounces of water when Iwake up in the morning as well as whileI exercise and if I've sweat a lotduring that exercise I often will drinka third element packet dissolved inabout 32 ounces of water after Iexercise element comes in a variety ofdifferent flavors all of which I findreally tasty I like the Citrus I likethe watermelon I like the raspberryfrankly I can't pick just one it alsocomes in chocolate and chocolate mintwhich I find tastes best if they are putinto water dissolved and then heated upI tend to do that in the winter monthsbecause of course you don't just needhydration on hot days and in the summerand spring months but also in the winterwhen the temperatures are cold and theenvironment tends to be dry if you'dlike to try element you can go to drinkelement spelled lm.com huberman to try afree sample pack again that drinkelement.comhuberman today's episode is also broughtTo Us by Aeropress Aeropress is similarto a French press for making coffee butis in fact a much better way to makecoffee I first learned about Aeropresswell over 10 years ago and I've beenusing one ever since Aeropress wasdeveloped by Allan Adler who was anengineer at Stanford and I knew of Allanbecause he had also built the so-calledaobi frisbee which I believe at one timeperhaps still now held the Guinness Bookof World Records for furthest thrownobject and I used to see Allan believeit or not at parks around paloaltotesting out different aobi frisbe so hewas sort of famous in our community fordeveloping these different Feats ofengineering that turned into commercialproducts now I love coffee I'm somebodythat drinks coffee nearly every dayusually about 90 to 120 minutes after Iwake up in the morning although notalways sometimes if I'm going intoexercise I'll drink coffee first thingin the morning but I love love lovecoffee and what I've personally found isthat by using the Arrow Press I can makethe best possible tasting cup of coffeeI don't know what exactly it is in theAero press that allows the same beans tobe prepared into a cup of coffee thattastes that much better as compared toany other form of Brewing that coffeeeven the traditional French press theAero press is extremely easy to use andit's extremely compact in fact I take itwith me whenever I travel and I use iton the road in hotels even on planesI'll just ask for some hot water andI'll Brew my coffee coffee or tea

the pluralof spectrum spectrums um you knowbecause when we hear the word spectrumwe think okay there's a spectrum ofseverity right and in fact I have someexperience with um severe autism not inmy family but where I went toundergraduate University uh UC SantaBarbara down the way from that schoolwas the Deo school which was a schoolwhich um has been there for a long timethat um parents would send their kids ifthey were quote unquote severelyautistic it was actually where um DustinHoffman went to um study for his role inRainman and the uh the kids who werereally delightful they used to come intotown every once in a while to the coffeeshop where I'd study and they would alsocontinue on from there to Kmart which iswhy the Dustin Hoffman character wouldsay gotta go to Kmart gotta go to hewould do that repetition right thatKmart was down the road from our youknow our College housing and the DeoSchool those kids were literally in a umaway from home facilityfull-time and I spoke to some of theparents at one point and they were atthat facility meaning the parents hadsent them their children away to livethere full-time of course they'd getvisits and they'd get visits home umbecause they were I suppose we could sayat the far end of some spectrum thatmade it at least to the parents ideaimpossible for them to be at home okaynow at the other end of the spectrum ifone is just simply thinking in terms ofseverity I know people who haveself-identified as a autistic that's howthey've referred to it so I feelcomfortable um saying that they've saidI am autistic um and they seem prettyhigh functioning meaning they havedriver's licenses drive cars are inhealthy relationships and manage lifeapparently well um they have some traitsthat yes I would agree are a little bitdifferent right so this is where we getinto neurode Divergence right um but Iguess the point is you know should wethink about autism as on a spectrum orgiven the fact that there are these umkind of collections of different traitscould there be a spectrum of severityalso a spectrum of um you know morestereotype behaviors um another spectrumthat intersects with that that has to dowith you know obsession with aparticular topic you know you couldimagine that there are you know 50 or 60different Spectra or spectrums I stilldon't know which one to say and thatwhen we talk about the Spectrum we'rereally talking about something that's inmultiple dimensions and not just oneline that goes from severe to mild doesthat make sense yeah I mean I think thisis where understanding the biologicalbasis of behavior would then allow us tobe able to say you like here's thesedifferent dimensions right but notunderstanding the biology you're leftwith okay we're are we lumpers orSplitters like how do we think aboutthis because autism is highly heritableso there's about 40 to 80% of autism isum is genetic right so these vary wildlyright but the but the common thinking isthat the majority about 50% of autism isum is associated with common geneticvariants and so the way that we'vealways thought about this is that thereis this you know autism is largely aninherited polygenic condition and butwhat I mean by that is that you have alot of common variants that are additiveand so if you think about thiscollection of common genetic variantthat underly the Spectrum right so ifyou have less of a dosing of some ofthese common variants you might seesomebody who's a lot more who's higherfunctioning like you said and if you endup with one of these single Gene Highpenetrant um disorders you might seesevere intellectual disability and sortof lower functioning on the other end ofthe spectrum but I think that there is alot that we don't know and what you'rebringing up I think underlines you knowsort of an issue with autism autismwhich is common for many brain disorderswhich is like if you don't understandthe underlying biological basis it alsogets very difficult to diagnose andtreat right and that's where we are witha lot of different you know psychiatricand neurodevelopmental disorders to datehas there been any specific neuralnetwork that we can point to and say Ahthat's the neural network that seems tobe different in people who are on theautism spectrum um I saw a studypublished recently that seemed to pointto the idea that the genes that arealtered in autism um at least include alarge number of genes that are alteredor the proteins that are the consequenceof those genes are alteredand exist at the synapse at theconnections between neurons and I'masking it that way because you know someyears ago I was at a talk on autism atStanford and someone raised their handand says um do we even know that autismis a brain issue right could couldn't itbe an issue of you know the immunesystem or the cardiovascular systemwhich at the time seemed like okay goshof course it's but wait then you stopand you think that's a really goodquestion right how do we know it's ait's a challenge of the brain right Ithink that's a great question right andthere may be people talk aboutjust take for a moment that this is abrain disorder how do you study it inpeople right so you know it's verydifficult to get access to eithercerebral spinal fluid which is a fluidthat bathes the brain um brain tissuebiopsies it's very hard to get peopleespecially children that are reallyimpacted into a brain scanner rightbecause they can't sit still they mayhave sensory issues they don't want togo into a scanner right so a lot of thetools that neuroscientists or orpsychiatrist have to think about lookingat the brain are um limited right andthen and then the other part is how doyou model so the other way we mightthink about getting access or orthinking about model systems what weneed to do is think about the controlanimals and we need to make sure thatthe species that we're modeling them inhas um features of control humans if youwill so we need to have complexcognitive abilities we need to havecomplex social skills we need to have anorganism that has Vision as its primarysensory modality right potentially sleepconsolidating so we need to think aboutall of those and and the the tricky partI think until fairly recently was thatwe were doing all of this work in Mousemodels and you know the control micejust fundamentally lack many of thecharacteristics that are needed to modelyou know autism with Fidelity right andI think that's you know when we look atdrug development pipelines about 50% ofpreclinical failures so that would besomething that's tested in an animalthat works and then fails in a humanclinical drug trial 50% of thosefailures can be attributed to poorlyselected animal models and so I thinkpart of where we we will be gettingtraction is picking you know developingsophisticated models as a sort of pointof entry into being able to understandsome of these things that are reallydifficult us studying people yeah such akey point and um for those that um havenot heard of pre-clinical modelspre-clinical models are non-human modelsso it could be Mouse could be nonhumanprimate could be flies or worms for thatmatter but uh we're going to talk a lotabout non-human primate preclinicalmodels um and the work that you've beendoing and of course also the work thatyou've been doing in humans um the otheranimal um the other private the otherprimate right exactly I love to remindpeople that we're primates um Old Worldprimates um thank you for doing that soyou've been talking about the genetic"

just about thefact that nature impacts the genome andour genome impacts the way that weinteract with the environment Etc sowhat is the role of the environment inautism both the frequency and thepresentation of autism right so I meanthere are again lots of differentepidemiological studies so um Advancedparental age uh prematurity severeprematurity is a risk factor for autismum maternal illness during pregnancy umso there's there's a bunch of differentthings that have been associated with anincreased risk for autism in terms ofenvironmental influences and how theycan intersect with Biology um one of thethings that I was really struck by inthe early 2000s that at least by my readof the literature hasn't really goneanywhere was this idea that was proposedby pashco who used to run theneurobiology department um at Yale umexpert in brain neuro anatomy innon-human primates and in humansembryology um really luminary of ourfield and he had a series of papersexploring how the migration of neuronsduring early development you know it'syou and I both know but most people outthere probably don't know because wehaven't covered this in the podcast umit's not typical dinner tableconversation you know when you when anembryo when a human embryo is developingthe the neurons are born at one locationand they migrate out some distance totheir final um resting place where thenthey grow out their connections andconnect with one another and thatprocess of neuron neuronal migration isoh so critical for the eventual wiringof the brain and rakes had this ideathat perhaps and I really want toemphasize perhaps that the more frequentincidents of autism might be correlatedwith the increase in early prenatalultrasound and he had these paperspublished in number of reallyhigh-profile journals includingproceedings of the National Academy andScience and elsewhere showing that in amouse model if you doUltrasound with each successiveultrasound you got more migration errorsright so there to me was a you know aninteresting example of of theenvironment frequency of ultrasound andcell migration having some sort ofinteraction but it seemed like it neverwent anywhere it never got tacked tookay you should keep in mind the numberof ultrasounds that you're getting foryour child and of course ultrasounds arecritical for for pregnant women to getbecause they can Stave off a number ofdevelopmental issues and they're superimportant but you know we've heard aboutultrasound you know it within thescientific literature and thenoccasionally we'll hear other theoriesabout okay it's having two parents whoare both engineers and then we'll hearoh you know it's um you know toxicity inthe food environment we've heard youknow hypothesis about vaccines or thethe adant that the vaccines arecontained in you know in that largecloud of thehas anything really um emerged from themas like okay there really seems to be atleast one major risk factorenvironmental risk factor because I feellike all those theories I come up getsome popular press bunch of papers arepublished sometimes those papers areretracted like in the case of thevaccines um and then the theory kind ofdies yeah so is there any specificenvironmental influence on autism thatwe can say yes they're really seems tobe something there yeah I I mean it's ait's a really spectacularly goodquestion I think the tricky part aboutit is that every single person thatcomes into a trial has a differentgenetic background right and so until wecan have these a priori stratifiedtrials where you could then you know asa good scientist you would onlymanipulate maybe one two variables at atime right but when you're doing theselarge epidemiological studies becauseyou can't it's very difficult to doexperimental studies right especiallywith developing children um I thinkthat's an incredibly difficult study todo right so there's been an interest inthis field of there's these neurogeneticsyndromes that have high penetrance forautism which basically means that youcould have a disorder um or you knowanother genetic condition let's say itdoesn't have to be a single Gene butthat a lot of those kids tend to alsoget an Autism diagnosis and so there'sbeen work and like so for instancefragile X is a good example wherebecause autism is so diverse in terms ofclinical presentation that let's say youhave a medication that could work for ahandful of kids in the trial you may notbe statistically powered to see it rightso so you know the way I think about theautism world is there's so little wedon't know so think about being in adark room and you have a flashlight andyou only see where you shine the lightright and so if you think about a veryheterogeneous genetic heterogeneousstudy it's going to be very difficult totease out these pieces because anenvironmental risk factor um might be adriver for one kid but not another rightand so I think what we need to do is tohave these genetically defined subgroupsof individuals and then be able to testthe G by Gene by environmentinteractions or in this geneticallydefined group of individuals um can wetest this certain medication to see ifit's beneficial for this subgroup ofchildren got it so you you mentionedfragile X which um we know um presentswith autism like symptoms in some casesand then I think of another disease likeum Timothy syndrome a mutation in an LType calcium channel which um for thoseof you that don't know what these celltype calcium channels are they'rethey're not just important for thefunction of neurons in the brain they'rereally important for the function ofneurons and other other tissuesincluding heart tissue right so um kidswith Timothy Syndrome have cardiacissues yeah and they have autism so youknow I think it's important for us tokind of explore this a bit because inmost people's minds you know kids withautism have autism and occasionallythey'll have other issues you know gutissues or heart issues or um muscularskeletal issues but we often think thatthat's the consequence of the autism butoften times that they have multiplethings going on and the autism actuallycould be secondary or independent of theother thing that's going on so this iswhat leads me back to this idea of aspectrum you know is you know is itpossible that what we call autism isactually like 50 different disorders or50 different conditions depending onwhat one wants to call them um I meanwhat is autism really I mean is it it'swhat does it really center around whatand I I think here maybe it's useful togo like do we go to the diagnosticcriteria like how do we decide if achild has autism if they also have abunch of other things that arechallenging them I I think that that'sThe $64,000 Question right and and andagain in other areas of medicine so ifyou think about let's think about cancerbiology right like decades ago somebodywould come in with cancer and you wouldhit them with radiation chemotherapy andthat was the best that we could do rightbut with the invention of a lot ofmolecular tools you can remove a a tumorand you can do molecular profiling andeven you know have personalizedmedications made right to attack that ttumor and so you know know what's reallytricky when you have a behavioraldiagnosis that's notbiologically defined you you see a lotof heterogeneity so it's incrediblydifficult I think to answer thisquestion because we don't know how manykinds ofautismsocial people people I've heardclinicians say well that's not reallyautism right that's a piece of fragile Xright but if it's a behavioral diagnosisand they meet be behavioral criteria itbecomes this weird circular argumentright so like until we really understandwhat autism is I I I think that it'sgoing to be very tricky to start youknowsubing different aspects of thecondition as we all know qualitynutrition influences of course our"

to autism in humansusing non-human primate models and thenof course to also discuss some of thework that you've been doing in humansand we can't have that discussionwithout first having a discussion abouttwo neuropeptides that I think mostpeople have heard of at least one ofthem and I think there's a lot ofmisunderstanding about but you're goingto clarify that for us which areoxytocin and vasopressin so before wedive into the uh the important work thatyou've been doing on vasopressin inparticular but also oxytocin andautism what are oxytocin and vasopressreally okay so they're these smalllittle peptide they're nine amino acidslong are very tiny they only differ bytwo amino acids and they're theseancient peptides that are hundreds ofmillions of years old and in almost anyspecies studied um whether it's thecurrent version you might have vasittocin or other Mosin which are um sortof precursor forms in other species butthey're highly evolutionarily conservedand they're involved in social behaviorum in pretty much any it could be egglaying it could be you know but butreproduction and social behavior acrossthe philogenetic tax so house cats makevasopressin and oxytocin humansobviously make vasopressin and oxytocinand pretty much every other species thathas to interact with and connect withother members of its species especiallymammals right so oxytocin and vasorpressin are pervasive and Maman speciesdo the different species tend to makeoxytocin and vasopressin in similarbrain areas and tissues um yes but notcompletely overlapping but I I think thething that the the beautiful mysteryabout these and the infuriating piece ofthem is that because they're sostructurally similar um they can havesimilar effects and they there's fourreceptors that they bind to so if youthink about a hormone or aneurotransmitter so oxytocin vasorpressent if you think about them like akey and a receptor like a lock and youhave to put them together to open a dooropen Behavior they can bind to thesefour receptors so it can be verydifficult todisentangle which one is acting and atwhich receptor and where in the brain ohso oxytocin vasopressin are chemicallysimilar yes interesting yes and uh wherewould you say lies their greatest umoutput Divergence which is just nerdspeak for um is there an example ofsomething that oxytocin does thatvasopressin doesn't and vice versa yeahokay so what's really fascinating isthese two neurotransmitters or hormoneswere discovered for their peripheraleffects which basically means not intheir brain but somewhere in their bodyand so oxytocin's involved in um uterinecontractions and milk let down and sowas during lactation so people sort ofalways thought of it as the femalehormone and then vasopress has um atleast in the in the peripheral systemhas been involved in um urine regul likeurinary output regulation blood pressureum and so we only knew about their theirphysiological roles as their sort ofclassic hormones for decades and whatwas interesting is these um like namingconventions are fascinating medicineright so you could name a virus afterwhere it was first found right or itcould be named after somebody whodiscovered the disease like Alzheimer'sfor instance is a good example and whatwas interesting oxytocin was only namedonce vasor pressin was named twice soit's either called Arginine vasorpressin or anti-diuretic hormone and soit had two different names and so as youcan imagine sometimes genes are namedtwice and so somebody in cancer isstudying one Gene and somebody andautism is studying another and they'renot even communicating because theydon't even realize that they've at leasthistorically now we have all kinds ofGene annotation sites so it's lesslikely to happen now but but what wasfascinating is they were these hormoneswere named oxytocin is Greek for quickbirth so for decades people onlyappreciated their physiological rolesbut but there were neuron anatomistsaying hey so these are both madethey're made in a lot of differentplaces but the the the action sort ofhappens in the hypothalamus wherethey're made and there were anatomiststhat said wait these sort of

and said you know oxytocin isorchestrating all these events ofmotherhood and there are sheep and goatsin particular that have offspring thatare precocious meaning they're basicallyborn ready you know within an hour theycan run with the herd unlike our specieswhich is altricial meaning we have veryhelpless infants and mom needs to bondreally quickly with that baby if it'sgoing to be running around and you onlyyou know from an evolutionaryperspective you want to be investing inthe baby that's yours not somebodyelse's right and um he hypothesized thatit was oxytocin that was beingco-released into the brain and duringmilk let down that was what turnedMother Love on and that was really thebeginning of this whole field ofthinking and so that opened up thinkingabout oxytocin in rodent maternal careand a variety of other instances can Ijust briefly interrupt you because Ifind this so interesting and I know it'sinteresting to everyone listening aswell because you know yes and thank youfor making it clear that oxid doin hasmany different roles um but this role ofMother Love and bonding to infant um hasme needing to ask whether or not theidea was that oxytocin is released inthe mother when she interacts with herown baby um and that leads me to thequestion is oxytocin also released inthe baby um in reaction to to the motherand how long is that effect lastingbecause in order to have a pervasivebond with that baby and not just someother baby and of course we still havevisual cues and you know we know ourbaby versus another baby most instancesum there are rare exceptions or perhapsnot so rare exceptions but leaving thoseaside youknow the mechanism that would allow formother infant bonding and infant motherbonding by way of oxytocin presumably issomething that is literally changingtheir brains saying it's you are the arethe center of my life right and the babyof course is saying well you are my lifebecause you are the source of life rightcertainly for the early part um earlypart of life and that nowadays it seemsthat that that can extend well into theuh the teens and 20s for some people butum you how how is oxytocin working is itis it working over the course of minuteshours is there some specificity of thisbaby and this mom that links them in insome more pervasive way I mean how isoxytocin doing this magic of bondingyeah I mean it's it's very speciesspecific right so I think that and youneed to think about like Theevolutionary history of the speciesright so if you think about sheep orgoats the early studies that were doneare you um The Passage through thevaginal Canal was what you know so youwould activate oxytocin receptors thatway but if you gave an oxytocinantagonist meaning you would give intothe brain something that blocked theoxytocin receptors so if the oxytocin isbeing released into the BL brain but youhave a pharmacological agent blockingits ability to bind to its receptorsthese sheep and goats wouldn't um bondto their baby for instance so literallythe passage of the baby out of thevaginal Canal triggers the oxytocinpathway the release of oxytocin as inlactation does too nature is sobeautiful because if you had to pick oneevent yeah to trigger the release ofoxytocin if oxytocin's role is to createbonding with offspring that would be theevent because that's a tough one tomistake right right but but what I willsay because I think you will you know toavoid you getting attacked on Twitter orwherever you might I'm GNA get attackedanyway if not if not for this discussionthen another one but I'm tougher than Ilike so um but it's really speciesspecific right so if you think about ourspecies and a lot of primate species welive in these extended family groups andthat's how we evolved and so unlike agoat or a sheep that might live in aherd where there's a lot ofnon-relatives we lived in a community ofrelatives right and so we and we do allkinds of care of extended relatives andso you wouldn't necessarily expect in aprimate species where you have this longrearing history where help from thefamily and and biparental care wherewhere sort of everybody sort of like ittakes a village to raise the baby wereadily adopt in our in primatesocieties right and so you know um likeI had a CE I mean I'll tell yousomething personal I had a C-section umand uh had I had a lot of postpartumcomplications and so lactation didn'twork out that well for me one of myfriends would say um I massive um DVSand Pulmonary emop and so I almost diedafter my son was born the first time andso I didn't have a vaginal delivery Icouldn'tDVT thrombosis yeah and it was sort oflike welcome to Motherhood and I was inthe ICU and um had to get a filter putin um an inferior vnea filter to um stopme from dying because the I hadscattershot clots all over my lungs andso I didn't really you know I didn't I Ididn't do a vaginal delivery I had aC-section and I wasn't really able tolactate and man I love that baby rightso you know I can give you know what Iwill say is um it's really different inprimates and we don't really understandhow bonding occurs but what I will sayis that bonding between a mother youreally need to think about theevolutionary selective pressure so I wasan evolutionary biologist before I foundNeuroscience right and so I reallyeverything I do I think about from anevolutionary perspective um so but it itis um many people go into the oxytocin Voppressing field because they have a lotof questions about social interactionsright like I think if you think about usis being social is actually one of theone of the core characteristics of ourspecies right so social interactions arerewarding from infancy they Keep UsAlive as you mentioned right and so Ithink it's not an accident that the waywe think about disorder in our speciesis many disorders are disorders becauseof lack of social connectedness right soit could be something like autism whereyou know there's these pervasive socialinteraction impairments it could besomething like drug abuse where you knowyou you a risk factor for drug abuse isfeeling you know socially disconnectedand alone right um social um isolationor loss of a loved one is a very strongpredictor of the onset of a stressrelated depressive anxiety disorder interms of when and how oxytocin isreleased you mentioned um mother infantbonding um I think you said yes that theinfant is also releasing oxytocin wethink um so it's it's bidirectional umwe think I think most of the work hasbeen done in mom would be and and againthis has not been really done well inprimates right so we're extrapolatingthis information from species that havedifferent evolutionary histories than usright so it's go sheeps um Prairie vsmice rats so what do we know about therole of oxytocin in humans do I mean weknow it's there yeah we presume based onthe animal models that it's involved inmother infant bonding um and presumablyromantic partner bonding at least youhear that a lot um it was unfortunatelynicknamed The Love hormone yes um andthe reason it's unfortunate it was isthat while that might cue attention tooxytocin and I'm you know a big fan ofpeople paying attention to biologicalphenomena it uh it discards the otherand many roles of of oxytocin but yeahwhat can we say about oxytocin in humansif anything like do we know that it doesI mean we're just so we're assumingbased on the animal models that it doessomething I mean this is very differentthan like dopamine where there's tons ofanimal model data but we know but theybrain Imaging where we know wheredopamine is expressed and do we evenknow where oxytocin receptors areexpressed in the human brain presumablythat information is is out thererecently but again there's a lot ofspecificity and I think if you'rethinking about disorders you would thenhave to study those specificsubpopulations right and and you needyou know a lot of this work has beendone so you have to think about how dowe study it right so the best way tostudy it would be to have radio tracerswhere you could then which we do havefor dopamine and and other compoundswhere you would then go and see whereafter somebody's performed a task do wesee you know um activation right oruptake um there are some Imaging studiesthey're usually done giving intranasaloxytocin um and then you basically askquestions about okay we give youoxytocin and trenas which presumablyenters the brain there's we could talkabout reasons why we think that um andthen we have you perform on some taskright and so you know there's evidenceif you give oxytocin it diminishes theamygdala's response um to fearfulstimuli right so that it might have thissort of pro-social effect and and it wasactually data like that that causedpeople to start thinking um initiallyabout oxytocin and those are data onhumans that's right it reminds me thatthere was this brief moment whereoxytocin wasn't just being discussed asthe love hormone it it was beingdiscussed as the trust hormon right alsoum far too simple heuristic but butagain I think it's cool that the youknow that the the Press picks up onthese things and at least tells peopleabout what's being discovered and wejust always have to be careful that notum uh have it leads the assumption thatthat's the only role of a given of agiven hormone so um it can reduceapparently it can reduce the output ofthe amydala in some way this brain areaassociated with um threat detection umand so you could imagine how that wouldbias the person toward being morepro-social right um have there beenstudies exploring the role of oxytocinin making autistic children morepro-social and behind that question Isuppose is the assump you can verify oror not that autistic children are lesspro-social than other children um isthat true um or is it that you knowautistic kids are just maybe morepro-social with the one friend theyreally really like um I happen to knowsome kids uh with autism or however youwant to phrase it and um they have closefriends and they seem to really likethose specific friends a lot like theyseem very happy when they show up at thedoor and like all all the Hallmarks ofyou know healthy social mind but it istrue that they are uncomfortable in ingroups and where there's a lot of noisea busy birthday party is overwhelmingfor them but you see them playing withone or two friends and like you couldsee all that and assume okay it's justkind of an introverted kid actually kindof reminds me of me you know I mean Idon't have a problem with crowds but I Imuch prefer to be with a small group offriends or one close friend so I hearyou I'm that way too right so um youknow how do we think about this um okaywell I would say the social features ofautism are interesting right and so youmight have there were there was anattempt a long time ago like 1979there's a woman named Lura Wing whotried to subtype the social features ofautism right and so there could bepeople um that are socially avoidant andreally just don't want to have socialinteractions there could be kids thatare um active but odd which means thatthey have an interest in being socialbut maybe they don't read social cuesright and they interact in ways thatother kids don't understand or makecould cause bullying right and soundslike Junior High School yeah exactly umand and that's often why um you knowsome autistic kids do better with adultsright because adults know how to sort ofChannel um discussions with somebody whomight be a little socially awkward rightbut there's different phenotypes I meanuh people having a disinterest in socialinteractions could be that they'rehighly socially anxious right um thatmaking eye contact makes them anxiousyou again that's another caveat um therehave been some studies administeringoxytocin to individuals with autism andagain these are these single dosestudies so the first studies that werewere done were looking at single doseoxytocin in males because some of theand we can talk a little bit about whyoxytocin versus vasopressin whichvasopressin actually would have been mychoice um based on the animal literatureand we can talk about that but vasoxytocin was given to males um partlybecause it wouldn't the idea would bethat the of Target effects in theperipheral nervous system I.E milk letdown uterine contraction are not goingto happen in males right and so that itwas deemed that they might be safersubjects males are often also the thego-to for research studies as you mayhave talked about on on your podcastbefore too something that fortunately ischanging thanks to a mandate by the uhby the NIH correct um I I had to justkind of um smile slash um raise myeyebrows a little bit at the idea thatyou know the the assumption thatoxytocin administered to males yes onecan see why it wouldn't cause milk downor uterine contractbut um but of there could be otherperipheral effects ofto and males butthey had to pick they had to pick one sothey went with males okay so um andthere is this higher incidence of autismin males so it's not a terrible place tostart you just would hope that theywould also do the the experiment onfemales but um so they're doing this bynasal spray so intranasal one dosecorrect and for reasons that I don'tunderstand it's 24 international unitsand I think maybe somebody did the firststudy using it and you know this is howscience happens right and it worked andso then everyone uses that protocol andso then there's been a lot of studieslooking at um you know there's onereading the mind and the eyes so can youlook at pictures of somebody's eyes andthen ask what is the emotion thatthey're feeling right after receivingthis or Placebo um where's your eye gazegoing in a picture right so one of oneof the theories is that people withAutism May at least a subset of themlack social motivation so maybe they'renot looking in the places like eyeswhere you rece receive a lot of socialcues that are relevant to socialcommunication and so some of these earlystudies showed that a single dose ofoxytocin in people that were um had highfunctioning autism so they were verballike you said they could come in forstudies and that it looked like it hadsome potential Effectiveness and sothere became a really strong interest inthe field to think about oxytocinpotentially is a therapy for autism andis oxytocin available over the counterdoes it require prescription I I meanyou see sites that are selling it butthat doesn't mean anything these daysright um there's gry Market there's allsorts of stuff going on um but I knowpeople that have used oxytocin umthere's actually a market for and by theway folks I'm not suggesting this butsomeone the other day told me thatthey've been regularly taking um uhoxytocin ketamine nasal inhalations umas part of their work with theirlicensed therapist on um like PTSD typestuff relating to let's just call itrelational trauma okay um so that'shappening um but let's just think aboutoxytocin alone for the moment um areparents of of autistic kids able to likebuy oxytocin nasal spray no so so itwould need to be written like theprescription would be need to be writtenby a um by a physician um and it's noton the market right so there's one thingwe should say is there's only two drugsthat are approved by the FDA to treatautism and they're both antis psychoticswhich they um they treat Associatedfeatures like irritability and they haveoff Target effects like weight gain andand and you know so we don't have anymedications that are currently approvedin the US or anywhere else for thatmatter to treat the core features ofautism interesting and um unfortunate umand hopefully that will change in thenot too distant future um do we knowthat children autism people with Autismbecause I'm going to just sort of assumethat um autism is stable over thelifespan um like if a child is diagnosedwith autism are they going to be anadolescent and adult with autism so Iwould say that in a lot of cases autismhas lifelong impact but there are peoplewho outgrow their diagnosis um you knowthere are people who respond well tobehavioral therapy um I mean obviouslyit's not the Cure All for everybodythere's lots of people who go throughintensive behavioral therapy andprobably see minimal benefits um but Imean it's certainly something thatoccurs in childhood for the diagnosisoccurs in childhood and it you know formost people will then be present acrossthe lifespan so we could say people withAutism because each study sometimeswe'll have adults sometimes you'll haveteenagers sometimes you'll havekids I'd like to take a quick break and"

            "text": "people with Autism assuming they meetthe criteria for being autistic at thatat that moment um have lower naturalcirculating or active levels of oxytocinbecause you know it's one thing for anasal spray to um of oxytocin to improvesocial functioning it's another um toknow that it that the effect isaddressing an underlying biologicaldeficit yeah that's it's such a greatquestion okay so we should unpack thatbecause there's been a lot of work inthis area so the first question is whereare we measuring the oxytocin right sowe mentioned oxytocin has all kinds ofeffect in the body as well as the brainand it's released into the blood butit's also released directly into thebrain and there's variable evidenceabout if you measure it in blood is it areadout of the brain or not right orshould you be looking at something likespinal fluid that's maybe a a betterbiochemical proxy of the brain um moststudies so what I will say is there werethere's been m a handful of smallstudies where there has been some youknow there's been some benefit Maybe nobenefit small effects we did a studythat was a small study at Stamford andit was based on um Mouse genetic dataand I'll I'll sort of walk you throughwhat we did um so there's multiple Mousemodels of these neurogenetic syndromeswhere um people have social impairmentright we can Qui quibble about whetherthat's autism or not but that they havesocial impairment and so that there arethis um fragile X Mouse there's a PRwillly syndrome Mouse which is themagile 2 Gene that um gets manipulatedand then there's a catnap two mouse andin all of those instances when yougenetically modify those mice you see areduction of oxytocin in thehypothalamus and what's interesting isthat um in those instances where you seethis genetic modification you do seelower blood levels in these geneticallydefined models what's really cool is youcan give oxytocin across development inthose models and at least in the cat toMouse you can restore oxytocin neuronnumber to equivalent of control animalssuggesting that oxytocin is doingsomething in these oxytocin deficientanimals right so these are not anoxytocin Gene manipulation but these arethese syndromes where you see as aconsequence of manipulating genes forthese syndromes that oxytocin getsknocked down right and so our thinkingwhen we went into our clinical trial waswhat if um its blood oxytocin levelsthat there going to be a subset ofindividuals that just make less oxytocinhumans and that maybe those are theindividuals who could who stand tobenefit the most from treatment and sowe were the first group um toask you know across this range ofindividuals who showed up and we did inall the trials that we'll talk abouttoday um these are done with mycolleague Antonio Harden at Stanfordwho's a child psychiatrist um and wealways have double blind meaning thatthe investigative team is blind and thatthe um or unaware I should say they'reunaware of treatment and then thefamilies and the children are unaware umand then they're randomized meaningthere's an equal chance you could geteither drug or Placebo um and they'reand they're controlled right okay so weasked if we know what your prepre-treatment pre-treatment bloodoxytocin level is who's going to benefitfrom treatment and we found a couplereally interesting things one was thatthe lower your Baseline so yourpre-treatment blood oxytocin level youshowed much greater benefit from theoxytocin intervention these are childrenone one intervention one nasal spraythis was four weeks sorry I should haveclarified this is four weeks oftreatment being um administered oxytocintwice a day okay and um and and so wesaw Effectiveness there may sorry tointerrupt so much but just uh males maleand female subjects we did but again youknow because the autism is male biasedand prevalence even if you make thisheroic effort to over recruit try to getmore girls in and um in in the study weusually try to aim for the prevalencerate because it's difficult to get girlsjust because there's fewer of them gotit okay but um boys and girls wereincluded they're taking oxytocin overthe period of several four weeks and ifthey started off with lower Baselinelevels of oxytocin you observed abenefit of the oxytocin treatment inthose individuals what about theindividuals who had normal to high youdidn't see much benefit right and sothat was a a cue to me to think thatthere may be a subset of individualsthat you know for whatever reason theyhave lower oxytocin and they may standto benefit more from treatment and noneof the prior studies had looked at bloodoxytocin levels and so what we hadthought was that well maybe if everybodyhad measured Baseline blood oxytocinlevels maybe some of these you knowmaybe there would have been more umpositive outcomes so but there's there'sa lot of controversy in this field aboutwhether oxytocin is a treatment forautism right so after we completed thattrial there was a largemulti-site um what's called a phasethree oxytocin treatment trial that wasdone at I think five sites and they gaveoxytocin for an extended period of timeum and they showed no benefit um and andwere they looking to see who started offwith low levels of oxytocin atpre-treatment so what was interestingabout that study um and there were a lotof issues with itwas that um oxytocin is something whereyou have to if you look at it itdegrades it's like that's kind of what Ijoke about right so you need to take itwe take when we go in we have like thesereally intense protocols right so you goin and we have vacutainer tubes that arecold and we put them on ice and then theFLOTUS takes the blood from the child alot of technical gymastics yeah and thenwe make sure we spin it in a centrifugecold and then we pipe head it onto dryeyes so like so we have very minimalloss of the signal and so if you don'tadhere to those rigid protocols which isvery difficult to do across multiplesites um it can be very difficult to getan accurate read of oxytocin and so Ithink for me it's still an open questionum they didn't see that blood oxytocinpredicted response um in that study umthe data weren't provided in the paperit was just said that they didn't um butit's still an open questionand so that you know maybe that is theway if you give it acutely like in thoseearly studies we talked about that maybeoxytocin you know diminishes Spar weknow that oxytocin decreases um thestress axis the hypothalamic pituitaryum adrenal axis and then it can diminishanxiety in animal models so we that'swell established um and in a former lifeI was a stress researcher so I've spenta lot of time thinking about this butbut it's sort of the sad thing is isthat once you have a negative trial itum there isn't a lot of interest infunding uh the work going forward rightand so I think it's still really an openquestion about if there is a subset ofindividuals that could benefit fromoxytocin replacement therapy right andit's and and until there's money to dothat work um we may not ever know theanswer well be it will be important forthat work to be done eventuallyhopefully the field will return to itdespite whatever Trends might behappening now I think it's important toknow for the parents of autisticchildren um whether or not there wereany negative effects of oxytocinAdministration in particular in thechildren that did not benefit fromoxytocin treatment the rationale is thefollowing well of course these thingsrequire a prescription um if a parenthas a child with autism especially ifthey're young enough that the behavioralinterventions could possibly stand agood chance of inducing neuroplasticityrewiring of the neural circuits thatunderly social connection well thenthere's this um Tim limited window um inwhich you know those parents presumablyare willing to try most anythingprovided it's safe right so let's assumeand I'm making up these numbers nowbecause I haven't seen this study butaccording to what you told me that let'ssay a third of the autistic boys andgirls that come in have um low Baselinelevels of oxytocin they're the ones thatare going to benefit from this oxytocinintervention the other 23ds don't wellgiven the difficulties of measuringBaseline levels of oxytocin most peopledon't have access to those kind ofresources um if it's safe to giveoxytocin no matter what well then if Iwere that parent I'd be knocking on myPhysician's door saying hey give me anoxytocin spray because my kid might fallinto that onethird category if and onlyif it turns out that oxytocin is safe togive but if there's a risk profile thatdoesn't justify that kind of shotgunapproach well then I wouldn't do thatyeah so um is oxytocin spray safe and ifso why doesn't every physician who has apatient with autism give them oxytocinnasal spray right it's a great questionand I I know that you know I'm a parentof three children and I know this senseof like you would do anything to helpyour child right and so I I think thetricky part is that so one thing I willsay is that all of the studies andthere's been many of them have shownthat oxytocin is um is relatively safein a pediatric population right um thetricky part is I don't know there'sPhysicians that you know really payattention to clinical trials and if theydon't see a benefit they may not bewilling to write the prescription rightso until we could identify a group ofchildren that could benefit you know weneed to create the opportunity forPhysicians to recognize that this couldpotentially still be a treatment rightbut that work you know but I I think thetricky part and what I will say is andwe can maybe talk a bit about vasorpress which you know my feeling is thatif I was placing bets and and having tochoose between these two my my moneywould be on vasor press well we aredefinitely going to yeah um talk aboutVaso pressent in detail I mean thereason I I mentioned that hypotheticalscenario is just the sense of urgencyand in some cases desperation thatparents feel and you know time's tickingand if oxytocin's safe then you know umI guess I'll put in my vote that youknow parents should at least talk totheir physician maybe even hand them thestudy um to consider but I can alsounderstand the perspective of apediatrician who says well listen it wasa small number of kids that benefited umyou're welcome to try it but I don't youknow it doesn't seem like the resultsare that impressive but um you this getsto a bunch of larger issues about youknow Medical Care and randomized controltrials and the desperation of parentsand kids to treat neurodevelopmentalchallenges um I I just want to askbecause it feels relevant in a in a real"

            "text": "way um you know if ultimately the goalof improving symptom profiles inautistic kids is about improving socialcognition and socialbehavior and that process involvesrewiring of brain circuitsneuroplasticity is there any reasonreason to think that other approaches toinducing neuroplasticity would bebeneficial even if they're not in thebiological Pathways that are disruptedin autism um I think for instance aboutthe now extensive use of ssris for thetreatment ofdepression some cases it works in somecases it doesn't side effect profilesare a serious concern yeah as I'vediscussed on this podcast before butultimately we know that depression isnot a serotonin deficiency in most casesssris or atypical anti-depressants likeRyon Wellbutrin and things of that sortwhen they work they probably workbecause of their ability to induce neuroor assist neuroplasticity right right umalso the trials on psilocybin are notreally about psilocybin they're aboutneuroplasticity at least the trials fordepression right there may be other usesof psilocybin that relate more directlyto the effects of psilocybin Butultimately you know what we're talkingabout here is the attempt to re wire thebrain in a specific way whether or notit's assisted by oxytocin or some othermechanism so the question is are theretrials happening where people areexploring say psilocybin MDMA which bythe way we know increases oxytocin andserotonin dramatically as well as umthings like atypical anti-depressants inkids that have autism not because wethink that those autistic kids aredeficient in any of the neurochemicalthat these drugs would Target but thatthese drugs can help rewire the brainand ultimately that's what these kidsneed right I it's a really great pointand I there might be subsets of kidsright there might be kids where therewould be a medication that would Targetother Pathways but that potentlyreleases oxytocin right that and butthere might be kids that have anoxytocin deficiency right but I thinkthat that circles back to your point atthe beginning or our point is thatautism is a very heterogeneous conditionand being ato know before you begin a trial rightlike who am I going to put into it andwhat is my primary outcome like onemeasure that I think is going to movethe needle right like it kind ofrequires a crystal ball so there's a lotof guesswork that goes into this um butI would very much like to see I I willsay one other thing that um there I havea colleague named Adam guella who's atthe University of Sydney and hepublished a paper a year or two ago nowsuggesting that oxytocin be may be mosteffective in kids at younger ages and II don't quote me somewhere between twoand or you know two and five or threeand six or something find the paper andput it in the show show notes but youknow so it could be to your point aboutneuroplasticity that oxytocin may bemaximally beneficial in younger agesright and if you're if these studies arethese Haj podes across ages and acrosssort of different socialphenotypes finding that signal is reallyimportant right and and maybe age is adriver or or maybe you know low bloodoxytocin regardless of what age you areor maybe in Adam's case if you recruitreally young children you're likely tosee a benefit just because the BL thebrain is wiring up and it's more plasticat you know younger ages yeah that'salso a vote um in my opinion um forearly examination of kids right likeparents really need to get autism screenand perhaps maybe the most importantthing is to make autism screening asavailable and as inexpensive as possiblefor everyone because of the importanceof early intervention even if it'spurely behavioral intervention butcertainly if it's behavioral and Drugintervention but the clinic wait timesare really long right so you have tohave a specialist who's capable todiagnose autism and so you could have aclinic where you know you're showingTroublesome features and a parent wantsto get their kid into a clinic and youcould have a 12mth or or 18-month waittime right and so there are a lot ofpeople that are thinking about are thereare there laboratory based tests that wecan develop maybe either for detectionor clinical referral right so could wecome up with a a biomarker panel forinstance where we might be able to saywow here's some here's a panel where wethink this child is at reasonable riskfor developing autism can we make surethey're prioritized for getting adiagnosis right so we can get them an anearly intervention but right now wedon't we don't have that right so havingsome sort of laboratory based testwhether it could bebiological um or if we could dosomething with ey gaze and there's a lotof companies working on these things nowto say this may not you know and andalso obviously again autism is alwayscontroversial in this field rightthere's so many different stakeholders alot of clinicians will say well I don'tI don't want a 30-second video clipreplacing expert clinical opinionthere's good reasons for them to feelthat way but I think if there was a wayto prioritize people that are in thisline um you know we could get diagnosesfaster well you wouldn't want falsepositives but I would think that a 30second video clip provided itselfsomething useful is going to be morevaluable than nothing yeah given thetime sensitivity uh what are some of thebarriers to um getting this behavioraltesting to be not just more prominentbut pervasive like it seems to me thatwell I recall in school they gave us thehearing test we all marched on the buswe get the beep test and you know um youknow for hearing um challenges uh we getVision tests you get the babinsky reflextest not the moment you come out of thewomb but pretty pretty soon after I meanwhy isn't this stuff um happening uh forautism um for every kid yeah it's notscalable right so you these interviewswith parents and the tests that you docan take hours right and and any givenclinician even if they're working reallylong hours there just aren't that manypeople that are have the extensivetraining needed to make these expertdiagnoses right and so I think thatthere's you know clinicians that aredoing the absolute best they can butthey can only see a certain number of ofpeople a week right and does it have tobe a physician sorry to interrupt doesit or could it could you know could awell trained technician do this yeahwell I mean I I think technically it's aDSM diagnos is right so it's usuallysomebody who has a clinical degree so itwould be a clinical psychologist itcould be a behavioral

Resource I mean particularly inimpoverished areas the mean age of anAutism diagnosis is years later than inwealthy areas where you know there'smany different medical specialist withparents you know that aren't workingthree jobs and you know can sit waitingaround you know and and really Lobby andand really advocate for their kids rightbecause you know if they don't show upfor work that day they're not going toget fired from their job right and so Ithink that you know if there's some sortof solution that allows there to be amore democratic approach to saying weneed a really quick way

            "text": "so you told us this is a molecule thatchemically is very similar to oxytocinum is it manufactured in the human brainand body yes okay do we know a subset ofthe sites that it's known to be producedand where it's of its actions are andyou mentioned the kidney and theanti-diuretic hormone um roles butwithin the brain like what brain areashave neurons that make vasopressin wellor have the receptors for I mean Thereceptors are all over are all over thebrain and again it varies depending onthe species and you know the way thereceptors are measured or in postmortemtissue right which can be very difficultto get good samples right and so we needto have that caveat going in um but yeahI mean it's it's made in thehypothalamus um and it's released allover the brain and there is vasor pressand receptors all over the brain rightand um what's really interesting aboutvaser press and I always sort of jokethat oxytocin you know always saw itsday in the sun if you will and thevasopress was sort of the stepchild thatwas like left you know sort of behindand and the reason why I find thisfascinating is again like I think backto my you know my my roots as a you knowevolutionary biologist behavioralneuroscientist and what was interestingis that there were studies in the earlyto mid 1990 showing that vasopressin wascritical for male social behavior and soum there was work you know there was avariety of people and I I think RobMinka mentioned this on his on on thepodcast he did about you know there's aa group of people like Sue Carter Larryyoung Tom inso some of these earlypeople and they gave Vasa pressen tomale Prairie voles and Vvasopressin was what induced um pairbonding um with a a female mate and alsopaternal care and and as I recall thoseexperiments were done in the context oflooking at um polygamy versus monogamyof these Prairie VES um Prairie VESversus like a different species so sameum genus but a different species so itmight be a Montaine V or you know highlyrelated but these other species soPerales are monogamous the males uh wellI mean that was the 50% divorce rightyeah that was I don't think it's thatbad but I think they're doing betterthan we are as a species that's true weshould look to them for pointers and allthe divorce folks are saying wait why'you say better I have some divorcefriends that have said divorce is likethe greatest thing so we always say likedoing better doing worse right um anywaythat's a whole other podcast um andcertainly not the hubman Lab podcast butor maybe it is but um or will be butyeah my understanding is is that youhave certain vs that mate with almostexclusively with one other V for theirentire lifespan and then you have othervs located elsewhere um that in thosecolonies they mate with lots ofdifferent well so the males and femaleshave lots of different partners um raisyoung with lots of different partnersmating with lots of different partnersand that if you give Vasa presson thenyou can make the I was want to call thempolyamorous but I don't know if theylove each other I'm going to answer formore and assume they love each other thepolygamous moles not polyamorous butpolygamous moles then become monogamouswell I yeah I would say that is probablynot the take-home message so thetake-home message would be they hadlet's say that there was like the goodvs right which are the Prairie VES andthey were the ones that formed thesemonogamous parir bonds dad participatesin paternal care with Mom they co- rababies together and then Dad chases offIntruders right and then there's themore Ace social vs and so these are likethe Montaine VES um and um we'll we'llsee it's a complicated story but there'sthese Montaine vs where um males andfemales live separately females likemaybe live on the male's territory themale mes with a few different femalesabsolutely doesn't provide any paternalcare at all mom raises babies by herselfright so that's these are really thelike 1950s versus 2020s yes yes to be toto broadly stereotype to broadlystereotype and if you give okay so forPrairie voles they're sort of primed toform bonds and to be the males to begood daddies if you will and all youhave to do is give them a singleinjection of vasopressin and you know oryou can give an antagonist and usuallythe way they form the bond is throughmating right so they you put them with afemale they mate they cohabit for a bitthere's been all kinds of parametricstudies I I can't remember how manyhours it takes to form a parabond um butthen you can do these things calledpartner preference tests and then youcan say here's the guy that you made itwith here's this guy you don't know andyou can do it for males you can do itfor females and they pick their partnerthey choose to go hang out with theirpartner the Montaine BS you know eitherafter meting with somebody May either beequal or maybe they'll even go spendtime with the new individual so thecleanest story was that Prairie volesare monogamous Mont voles are notmonogamous but in the prairie vs youcould give vasor pressen instead ofmated cohabitation and you could turn ona like you know a bond with somebodyafter only living with them for a veryshort period of time right um or youcould induce paternal behavior and I wasworking with a V species in grad schoolI think the most interesting scientificexperience that I've ever had right andyou and I both know this right whenyou're young you're actually the persondoing the work right as you become youknow the head of your lab you're mostlywriting grants and giving talks rightand then you get to hear about the supercool things that every in your lab isdoing right eventually the the membersof your laboratory kick you out of thelab they literally say like get out ofhere you're leaving things in the wrongplace whereas initially you're tellingthem hey that's in the wrong placewithin a year or two for me I think ittook about four or five years but byabout year six right I was um demoted tomy office to just write grants and writePap I was told that one time I was backthere and I tried to waigh and I waslike so excited what they were workingon and they basically just said go writegrants and bring in more money rightlike that was kind of their attitudelike we get to be the ones who get to dothe cool stuff so back when I got toactually do the science um I remember Ihad this species where and I and again Itold you I came at this from anevolutionary perspective so these werecalled meadowes and I found them veryinteresting so when I showed up in mythesis advisor lab she I said I reallywant to study oxytocin and vasopressinand I really want to study VES and Iknow you have a v species and she saidwhy I don't have prairie vs I have thesemeow voles and I'm studying them becausethey're so sensitive to light and theychanged their behavior based on lightand I she said well you can do what youwant but our grants basically have tohave a circadian component and so shesaid you got to work that in but then wekind of struck this deal so I washanging out in the animal rooms and Ithought it was really fascinating so shehad animals that were either on shortday lengths or long day lengths so themimicking some um summer and winter andI was noticing that on winter daylengths the the males were hanging outwith the females and when the female hada litter he was like participating and Iwas like whoa these are not supposed tobe monogamous animals and so I went intothe field research and they were doingall these radio telemetry studies and solike if you I we should probably explainwhat those are putting a littletransmitter um under the skin it'spainless for the animal but that allowsthe researcher to um monitor thebehavior of the animal remotely withouthaving to you know put them in cages andstuff so and so this is like under fieldconditions and vs are everybody'sfavorite snack so they have like a verylimited lifespan in the wild I mean likeon the order of months and and so likeif you have a short lifespan like youshould just keep reproducing right andso what was interesting is at the end ofthe summer days as you're going intowinter territories collapse and malesare found with females and they co- rababies it makes sense if it's you'regoing to have a litter and mom needs toget up to go eat you need somebody tosit there and warm those babies orthey're going to die because they'regoing to freeze to death right so Istarted saying like wow I think thesemetales are good dats like I'm noticingthis and so I told my thesis adviser Iwant to study how oxytocin invasor presscan maybe this is involved in trackingthese evolutionary mating strategies andso again like the coolest experience Iever had was on these males that werehoused under short day length so theywere like winter males um I was able toput Vaso pressent directly into theirbrains and and it was like turning on alight switch and they ran around thecage picked up all these babies put themin a nest and huddled over them and ifyou put a placebo into their brainnothing happened and so to me I alwaysfiled that away in you know in the backof my mind of like wow Vasa pressin isthis really interesting hormone um andmaybe someday I will I did a postto onsomething else but it was always youknow back in the back of my mind of Ireally want to return to this it's soincredible that a eight amino acid longpeptide could basically turn these umrelatively negligent fathers into veryattentive fathers yes yeah it wasfascinating right that I mean it justspeaks to the power of the peptide basopressent also speaks to the power ofbrain circuitry it also speaks to theidea that brain circuitry is oftensitting latent in the background youknow ready to be activated that it's notjust about neuroplasticity and buildingup a new circuit that some forms ofneuroplasticity are about unveilingwhat's what's already there and thatpeptides can act like switches um whichyou know kind of makes sense on the onehand but um I've never heard of a resultas dramatic as that soum I'm presuming you're going to tell us"

momalways says Chance favors the preparedmind and so I was doing my postto atStanford and I got recruited to stay onthe faculty and I you know had beendoing work in stress vulnerability andstress resilience and I really and Ilove doing that work but I still feltthis tug of you know I had spent allthis time in a Psychiatry departmentwhere I was surrounded by clinicians andI realized that a lot of the stuff thatI was doing had clinical relevance rightand so sometimes you sort of meet themoment right and so right as I wastransitioning to to have my own lab inmy department there was uh a bunch ofstuff going on so there were a lot ofvery dedicated parents who were lobbyingfor funding for autism research becauseit was horrifically underfunded reallyhorrifically underfunded wow I mean atrates of one in 36 well not at the timeright so it was it was 1 in 150 orwhatever it was back then but there wereall these parents and and I I mean againthey're heroes in my eyes that they adated so much for their loved ones and sothere was you know they started formingparent Grassroots organizations thathave culminated they all started joiningtogether which is now Autism Speaks umand then there was a man named JimSimons who runs um one of the mostsuccessful hedge funds in the world andhe decided wow I'm gonna you knowthere's let's put money into autismright and so does he have a personallink to autism I you'd have to ask himbecause often times not always but oftentimes when you hear about um wealthydonors um devoting a lot of money to onearea of science there's there's afamilial thing there you know a memberof their family or a close friend hasthis Challenge and they they really wantto see that challenge absolutely I meana lot of money I've gotten for my labfrom philanthropist and what I will sayis the most impactful work I've everdone is through philanthropy right thereare crazy ideas that no funding agencyever touches right um but yeah so theyput they both put um a lot you knowthere there was a lot of emphasis and sobecause the s's Foundation startedissuing requests for applications therewas a group at Stanford that formed andit was um um a clinician with a basicscientist and my chair at the time saidwell you know almost nothing is knownabout the biological basis of autism whydon't you go I'm going to introduce youto the the the head of child psychiatryyou should go talk to this group and soas I Was preparing my slides andrealizing that you know socialinteraction impairments were a corefeature of autism I thought wow you knowthese neuropeptides May really be youknow um a part of this puzzle and sothat's actually really how I got pulledinto um autism research was was throughthat and it was I I was you knoweverybody at the time was veryinterested in oxytocin and you know Iremember thinking so we actually didprobably the most definitive bloodoxytocin um study because there was thisidea again like this marketing campaignof like the oxytocin deficit hypothesisof autism and you know given howclinically heterogeneous autism was wegot money actually from the Simonsfoundation and we did the first studywith maybe 200 kids um and what we wereable to show was that blood oxytocin wasnot a marker of autism right so itwasn't like there was a bimodaldistribution meaning two completelynonoverlapping levels of oxytocin inpeople with Autism people without autismso the lower your blood oxytocin levelsum actually regardless of who you wereyou could be a child with autism youcould be an unaffected sibling withautism or you could be a unrelatedcontrol child and it was the lower yourblood oxytocin levels the greater yoursort of social difficulties and theslopes you know were different theystarted at different points because thebehaviors were obviously different butthat's what got us thinking about ourclinical trial which is that bloodoxytocin level is not going to be thisgreat differentiator between people withand without autism right but we might beable to find a subgroup who couldbenefit from treatment but what I likeso much about your approach the way youdescribed it is that it it sets aside wedon't we don't want to say discards butit sets aside this thing that we callautism yeah which is already hard toDefine and diagnose and there's allthese different spectrums and you'retrying to F and just says okay childrenwith autism have challenges in socialcognition social behavior social bondingyeah so do adults with autism for thatmatter matter let's just focus on thatyeah and not worry so much about whetheror not somebody is diagnosed as Autisticor not and just focus on what are someof the potential neuropeptide deficitsor overexpression of neuropeptides thatmay in some way relate to those SocialChallenges right and then one can Circleback to the question about autism incollecting those data but it also pointsto this idea that like when we when wego after a disease like Alzheimer we canoften miss the possibility thatAlzheimer's while it has you knowdeficits in cognition and memory couldalso be a bunch of other things like ametabolic disorder of the body and somaybe you go after a particularsymptomology yeah and try and attackthat and you might actually potentiallytreat or cure multiple diseases it's avery different approach and I I hope umpeople are catching on to the thesubtlety but also the the the potentialimpact of that um because if I heardcorrectly you said there are people whoare not autistic who have socialfunctioning deficits and they too haveless circulating oxytocin right so Iwould say we haven't studied peoplewhere we brought them in andcharacterized it right so these aretypically developing kids but what wedid is in the abilities that are typicalof a controlled child we still saw thatgradient right and so I think it justsort of begs the question about you knowwhat is oxytocin's role in humansociality right I mean I think there'sjust so much that we don't understandabout both of these molecules um interms of their disease liability ifthey're low or their healing potentialif we are you know able to use them asmodulators um of othertherapies so how did you move fromoxytocin to vasopressin um you mentioned"

everybodyum you know maybe that'll change butit's I think it's going to take a lotmore than that but um maybe it's becausethe name isn't as there's somethingabout oxytocin that like kind of soundslike the love looks like the lovehormone but like vasopressin should berenamed right well it should be calledsomething else like not anti-erotichormone not vasopressin I mean you'regoing to tell us how criticallyimportant it is perhaps even moreimportant than oxytocin for autism andsocial functioning so I don't know bythe end of this podcast we'll we'll comeup with a new name I it's needed rightwell I'll put it out there um uh okay sohow did you get to vas oppressor okay soit was interesting with oxytocin becausewe didn't you know and again I wasskeptical that we would see these biggroup differences but you know it was alittle bit of like okay you know whateveryone's saying this is not going tobe the big solution right um and so Iactually came at it from the work thatwe did in monkeys and so I think Imentioned previously at the beginning ofthe podcast that there were a lot oflimitations that I saw and thensometimes if you come into a field youknow when you're you're a little bit ofan outsider right like I'm not aclinician I don't see autism patientsbut I also I have this really stronginterest in social behavior and thebiology of it and so I I was thinkingabout what are what are things that weneed to do to better address thechallenges in autism so one of them waswhy are we looking in blood right likeif you look at neurological conditionsthere's been a lot of progress made bydoing biomarker Discovery in cerebralspinal fluid right so like the thebiological substrates or or clues ofmarkers of say um various forms ofDementia or um or MS were for firstfound in spinal fluid right because it'sthe it's the fluid that bathes the brainin the spinal column and so if you'relooking for the bio chemistry of anillness that's the closest fluid thatyou can get to the brain right so blooddraw just won't do it maybe right sothat was part of my thinking but thenthere was the issue of the animal modelsright so there was drug after drug afterdrug that was tested in mice and theyfailed in human clinical trials and soit made me start thinking could wedevelop a primate model um of naturallyoccurring social impairments right socan we because in autism these socialimpairments are if you will naturallyoccurring right and so you know this isthese spontaneously occur in children umand so it made me wonder could weidentify monkeys in a large Colony thathave socialimpairments in and after talking to toclinicians who who treat these childrencan I spend a lot of time validating amonkey model where there will be monkeysthat have features that look like theyhave direct relevance to core autismsymptoms um and so what I did wasthere's a um primate Center theCalifornia National Primate ResearchCenter and so what we did is so I thinkI mentioned earlier that there's thesesurveys that can be used to look atautistic traits in the general humanpopulation right and so we refined oneof these and we did what we call backtranslate so basically it's aninstrument that's used for humans andthen what we did is modified it to beable to to use this rating scale inreesus Max which are an old world monkeyand I know you're familiar with them andum and I was interested in looking atOld World monkeys because they're someof the closest relatives to human thatare used in biomedical research and andum as I mentioned previously theseautistic traits are continuouslydistributed across the general humanpopulation and that thisgenetic uh say let's call it geneticliability which is a fancy way of justsaying that we think that there's athere's a genetic risk that underliesthis Continuum of Behavioral traitsright so if we think that that's true inhumans and in one of our closestrelatives and we think that some ofthese genes create proteins that thenare what sets up the developing brain todevelop in the way that autistic brainsdevelop so let's just assume that that'sthe premise that's what we went with canwe find reesus maacs that are justliving in large outdoor colonies andidentify animals that might be good ummodels for autism and the answer is yeswe could do this all kinds of differentways one is we could just take peopleand um score monkey behaviors outsidetheir cages while they're interactingwith their peers we can use ratingscales and again the rating scale we Edit's called the social responsivenessscale so this is called the MAAC socialresponsiveness scale revised it's amouthful um but what it allows us to dois measure autistic like traits inmonkeys and we can also bring monkeys infor experimental test to see where theireyes look or how do they perform how dothey respond to videos of other monkeysyou know if they're making affiliate ofovertures do they um do like you knowyou know ma goo which is a a positiveresponse well they do that right I I umI'm going to apologize for interruptingyou again but I just have to tell peoplethis because I spent time up at the UCDavis primate Center as a graduatestudent and and by the way what we'rereferring to here are non-invasiveobservational studies at least thus farso these are monkeys living in large uhexclosures not enclosures largeexclosures um forming colonies andsocial relationships and um you know Ithink anyone that sees monkeys at thezoo and we all learn that monkeys go andthey don't if you want a monkey to likeyou you learn this working with macx umfirst of all they don't the affiliativecall isa they do this really nice and thelittle ones the babies I spend a lot oftime with these monkeys and the littleones they do this thing where they go Iused to I used to nurse the little onesevery once in a while they and they'rejust you know just like makes your heartmelt I think there must have been anoxytocin dump at that moment that'sprobably happening right now but if youwant the monkeys to like you you have togive an affiliative facial gesture whichis not a smile that's actually anaggressive gesture so as Karen Dr Parkerjust showed you it's lip smacking whichis so if you see a monkey at the zoo andyou want it to pay attention to youyou're going to have to lip smack and ifit doesn't either you're not doing itright or it just doesn't like youexactly right great all right thanks nowwe'll go back to the uh the study of uhor the establishment of this really keyexperiment right so then what we did iswe identified these these animals and wespent a lot of time so one one of thethings that I do as one of my areas ofexpertise is validating animal model soa lot of like I mentioned like a lot ofreason why experiments fail is peoplewill take an animal off the shelf andsay oh I'm going to do this right but ifyou're you know if you're studying adisorder that's characterized by visualissues is it is it the best thing to doin a nocturnal species that has oldfaction as its primary sensory modalityor you're referring to mice right or isit better you know and again I will sayall models have value there's all youknow there's reasons you just have toyou know you basically have to stand bywhat you're modeling and so I think oneof my the biggest issues I have with asort of mouse phenotyping Mafia is thatyou know there's this group of teststhat they use and they use it in everysingle disorder right and then ifthere's a positive hit it's like oh thisis like you know this test is really forParkinson's today but it's fordepression tomorrow right and so so mygoal was to to devise very specifictests that would allow us to evaluateyou know core features of autism in thismodel and the answer is we found itright so if you you look at monkeys thatspend a lot of time alone they have amuch greater burden of autistic liketraits measuring on this rating scalethey have diminished social motivationsso other monkeys will come up andinteract with them but they don't engagein um social overtures them that muchthemselves they do less grooming less uhaffiliative um behaviors um they in someof the work that we're doing they don'tlip smack back and we can talk a littlebit about that we did a pharmacologicalprobe and we can talk a bit about whatvasor press does to that which is kindof exciting um and so we spent a lot oftime validating this behavioralphenotype right to say that we reallyfeel like there are are core aspects ofit that are allowing us to model autismright um and I have a paper which if youwant to put it in it's all aboutcreating this monkey model and and andthe power of of doing it and where it ittook us clinically we will provide alink to that in the show note captions Ialso just want to um throw up my votefor the the fact that you did this work"

somebiomarker Discovery so what we wanted toask was are there any molecules thatallow us to differentiate these whatwe'll call them naturally low social orlow social monkeys from soci sociallycompetent high social monkeys and so wemeasured a bunch of different umreadouts of neurotransmitter systemsthat were either involved in Mamansocial behavior had been implicated inidiopathic

algorithm where we just saidhere's all this information help meclassify if this individual is high orlow social for cerebral spinal fluid iscollected by spinal tap correct in myunderstanding I've never had one um butthat spinal tap is of course moreinvasive than a blood draw but it stillis um done as an outpatient thing inhumans like you can go in get a needleinserted into the lower spine by by anexpert um they're going to draw cerebralspinal fluid I mean not that much moreinvasive and timec consuming thangetting a a needle into your vein for ablood draw right I mean it's it's wethink of it as it's technically a littlebit more challenging um but their CSFdraw humans all the time right so intheory this could map to a human studyand it did which we'll talk about coolso we went out and we did this I havethis spectacular statistician who's wewe spend a lot of time together his nameis Joe Garner and um and he is astatistical genius and so he developedthis and and we do all of our worktogether or you know I would say 95% ofit we just love working together and hedeveloped a statistical winning winwingstrategy to identify what were the keydrivers and what was fascinating is inthis first monkey cohort it was thecerebral spinal fluid levels ofvasopressin that were really what wasdriving this classification right so ifwe just knew your levels of your ofvasor pressent in spinal fluid but notin blood interestingly um we couldpretty closely perfect to perfectclassify you as high or low social andso then we replicated that again inanother monkey cohort because obviouslyit's a scientists you always want toreplicate your work and then if it wasreally a biomarker meaning it's amolecule in the body that gives us um anindication of something and in this caseit's an indication of your Socialfunctioning we were able to look at ummonkeys and we saw that the Vasapressent was consistent acrossmeasurement time so there was a widevariety of Vasa pressin levels butwithin an individual monkey it waspretty much the same right so that'swhat you want to see with the biomarkerand then we showed that the vasorpressen levels were closely uh linked touh groom SP grooming uh time spendinggrooming and as we mentioned I think wementioned earlier grooming is in manymonkey species a critical behavior thatsolidifies social bonds and maintainsthem and so the individuals with thelowest CSF phasor pressent levels had uhspent the less time the least amount oftime in in grooming grooming othermonkeys other monkeys yeah thisallopathic grooming is a veryinteresting behavior and um fromwatching chimp Empire I can tell youthat um new relationships areestablished in many ways by um monkeysthese chimps chimpanzees sort ofoffering their back for grooming and ifanother um chimp elects to yes groomthat um chimp then it establishes someform of trust and it and it all seems tohave to do with proximity like how closeare you going to let me get to you viceversa in humans that you know we talkabout personal space and there's a wholeset of things related to consent in thiswhole allopathic grooming thing and thenif they um you know if a if a chimpmisbehaves on on an outing then theyaren't groomed by others and they canactually get parasitic infections and itcan be very costly uh it's veryinteresting you know uh to just think ofalpath grooming as a as not a um kind ofa primitive of language but a wholelanguage into itself absolutely yeah andand also just critical for the speciesso that was really interesting to methat we were seeing these hints thatvasor pressin could be you know reallyimportant but of course you knowsomebody will say and I will say upfrontmonkeys don't have autism right so thenthe question becomes does this havewhat's called translational value so you"

            "text": "know can I see this observation in an ananimal model and will it providefundamental insights into humans rightand so I wanted to get cerebral spinalfluid from people um to test thishypothesis because we had in paralleldone a study looking at blood vasoppress levels and people within withoutautism and we didn't see a groupdifference there unlike this reallyprofound difference that we saw when welooked at spinal fluid and the monkeyand again I think I mentioned the bloodvasor press levels wereindistinguishable if you were higher lowsocial monkeys so there was somethingabout looking more proximate to thebrain that was giving us moreinformation than say the blood alone andso I said I wanted to get spinal fluidand like you said people do this all thetime how would we um but we're you knowit's not going to be a first passespecially when we don't really have anyevidence in people to go in for what wewould call a research lumbar punctureright and so I had to get reallycreative about how do I get spinal fluidfrom children and what we did was wepiggybacked on to a clinical indicationfor um a spinal fluid draw so and and wedid this so I tried to get funding forthis this is like you know again I meanI think this is important for people toknow how science is done right and so Iwrote all these Grant applicationsnobody would fund it they said that thisis really interesting it's too high riskyou won't be able to pull it off and youknow I don't usually back down from achallenge like if I think thinksomething's a good idea and I want to doit I'm going to find a way to do it ifsomebody if it's impossible that's onething but if it's hard to do it doesn'tmean you shouldn't do it you just haveto figure out how to do it and so Ialways try to see Bridges where otherpeople see barriers right and so it'slike well how can I access spinal fluidand so I went around talking to all myfriends who were on and Stanford'sreally wonderful because it's such asmall school right and so you're on allthese different committees with allthese different people and so lot ofcommittees lots of I can attest lot ofComm exactly but it's really becauseyou're on them with people from alldifferent departments I know people indepartments that I wouldn't otherwiseknow um and you get very uh you get toknow these people well in these manycommittees and where we live it's asmall community right so like maybe werethe experiment Karen maybe there's a Ialways wonder whether or not there's alarger experiment right not on monkeysnot on the the patients or the Clone butlike we're maybe we're the experimentright and they're looking at how weinteract on committees anyway pleasecontinue so I started going up to peoplethat I knew and said hey if you'reyou're taking spinal fluid can I get alittle bit of extra right and of coursewe got you know IRB approval meaning wehad ethics approval and all this and umor you could get the remnant sample andobviously again get consent from thefamilies so we could either get a littlebit extra when it was being drawn for aresearch indication so so they weregetting a spinal tap no matter what andthen we were just either we're getting alittle bit extra or we were going togetting the remnant that they were goingto throw out right so you usually takemore than you need because you don'twant to have to do another spinal tapright and so we were able to go aroundand I hustled around and got all thesepeople involved to help me we put um hotpink stickers on the lumbar puncturetrays so that in the emergency room soif somebody was doing a spinal tap theywould call us so we knew about it and wecould get you know samples um againunder people's consent um so we got allthese people involved and we finally gotsamples from children with autism andchildren without autism and then we alsomade sure that whatever they were beingworked up for was negative right so wegot the the sort of healthiest people wecould given that everybody was coming infor a medical reason to have a lumbarpuncture and in this in this first studywe had seven children with autism sevenchildren without autism and we couldnearly perfectly classify 13 out of 14individuals by just knowing their CSFvasor pressent level Alone um which ispretty remarkable given that there isn'ta biological indicator that we a robustbiological IND Ator that we know sobasically in this relatively smallcohort yeah having low vasopress is thebiomarker of autism correct and andagain and what I will say is in ourmonkey studies and in our human studiesCSF oxytocin level became our controlright so in our monkeys there were nodifference in CSF oxytocin by group umand then in this first study um therewere no differences in CSF oxytocinlevels um uh a sample size of 14 isintriguing but given autism soclinically heterogeneous we want toreplicate it and so I knew that therewas um a professor at the NIH named umSue swedo who was collecting uh cerebralspinal fluid in as part of a researchstudy because she was interested inimmune parameters and fate deficiency soshe had children that were medicallyhealthy and they were getting you knowjust like at ni you get these hugeworkups right so they were verywell-characterized participants so wewere able to look at and again we alsothis is the first time we were able tolook at girls so we had a small sampleof girls and we had boys and webasically just asked the question can wereplicate this and I was very interestedin well will oxytocin be what'sdifferent in the girls right so maybethere will be some sex specificity hereand that we'll see low CSF vasor pressinin the males and low CSF oxytocin girlsthat was not the case what we found wasthat if in the individuals with autismregardless of their um biological sex umthat they all had lower CSF phasorpresson levels than the individualswithout autism and because they were sowell characterized we were also able toshow on a gold standard researchdiagnostic assessment of autism so it'sa an assessment that's used um uh to ina research situation to validate anAutism diagnosis by an expert clinicalopinion that the lower your vasopresslevels in spinal fluid the greater yourum social symptom severity um yourclinical symptom severity and then weasked it's like well vasor press'sinvolved in social behavior but it's notreally that involved in restrictedrepetitive behaviors and that wasactually the case so it was the CSF Vasapress and track the social symptomseverity not the repetitive symptomseverity suggesting that there might beother biological measures that could beincluded as a way to you know have amore powerful way to differentiatepeople with and without autism um and sothen I was really so so that was reallyexciting to replicate that um and then Ihad a colleague named um JohnConstantino who um is now at Emery buthe used to be at wasio and I knew thatJohn I had been at a meeting in I thinkit was 2010 and I found out that he hadwhat I will call Liquid Gold so he hadthis uh minus 80 uh C freezer um thatwas uh had a bunch of um neonatal infantCSF samples that he had from Humaninfants and he had collected them andagain this was under ethical approvalsand it was basically they these infantscame in for something that needed to beworked up that was very rare um but ifthey had it they would you know theythey could die so they needed to get amedical treatment for it but the thevast majority of these children ended upbeing healthy so it was a pretty healthysample if you will right and so I knewhe had all these samples and I said tohim wouldn't it be really interesting ifwe teamed up and we look at this uh CSFvaser press finding in children beforethe period when behavioral symptomsfirst manifest right and so so sorryagain to I'm going to apologize everytime no no no I just but I think it'simportant because this was a questionthat um I was thinking about earlier andI imagine many other people were too youknow you find these monkeys that havesocial uh interaction deficits you findum kids that have social interactiondeficits and you see that there's lowvasopress in both groups this extends tomale and female children but then ofcourse the question becomes well maybethey have low vas oppress because of somany years or even months of socialinteraction deficits right that the thedirection of causality isn't clear andso yeah when you said Liquid Gold youknow referring to the um CSF from theseinfants um taken prior to anyopportunity for social interactionBeyond just you know whateverinteraction they had with their theirmother up until the point the the CSFdraw was taken um this really gets atthe issue of causality right so it's aquasi perspective you know because itwas banked and then a lot of time wentby right and so what we realized wecould do was and this was a heroicundertaking on John's part so these wereum this was these samples were collectedback on paper medical records so he hadto trace 2,000 paper paper what's thatyeah exactly so he had to trace 2,000 Ithink paper medical records to anelectronic medical record and then whatwe did is we he looked to see who wenton to develop autism and who didn'tright so then what we had with spinalfluid samples that have sort of beenwaiting in the freezer if you will andthen we could ask you know doindividuals who later receive an Autismdiagnosis many months or even yearslater already have low vasopress levelsas infants and the reason why this was acompelling question to ask is there'sevidence to suggest that behavioraltherapies are more effective the youngerthe child is right and if you thinkabout it if if behavioralcharacteristics of autism emerge acrossdevelopment you know what if and thiswas my this is sort of my we haven't wehaven't substantiated this yet but thisis like sort of my big question what ifall these autism susceptibility genessummon interact and converge upon a fewcommon Pathways in the brain right andso for years people have talked aboutthis excitatory inhibitory balancetheory of autism but what if vas oppressis one of those Pathways because it's socritically involved in Socialfunctioning and so what I was interestedin and so let let's just say for amoment you know your genes are set atBirth what if the Vaso prestent isalready low in the brains of theseinfants and so it puts them on this verydifferent trajectory where you have thiscumulative effect of they're maybe alittle bit less socially interested andmaybe they're not making the eye contactand if there was a way to intervenereally early even potentially with avasopress and replacement therapy thatyou might be able to put them on adifferent developmental trajectory sothat was my big what if questionand what was really remarkable was so Ihad been asking John hey can I have yourspinal fluid samples and and he finallyagreed after he saw a couple of thosepapers understandably he wanted to makesure that we already had shown somethingin people and animals that were sort ofif you will symptomatic with socialimpairment and what we found was yesthis was the case so it was a

differ betweeninfants that received a subsequentautism diagnosis and those that didn'tso suggesting that we have abiomarker that you know might really bea good readout for you know clinicalreferral or risk management monitoringincredible so you're telling us thatlevels ofvasopressin correlate with socialcognition deficits that right I thinkthat warrants a brief discussion aboutcerebral spinal fluid I teach neuroAnatomy to medical students so umforgive me for for having to ask thisbut you know I think of cerebral spinalfluid as the stuff that exists in theventricles and down the central Canalthe spinal cord and provides essentialnutrients and uh for neurons and othercell types in thebrain but it's also a reservoir forchemicals coming from the brain which iswhy the spinal tap is useful right umbutin the context of a cerebral spinal tapand you're measuring CSF and you'reseeing okay lower levels of vas oppressin these individuals with thesechallenges with social deficits doesthat mean that they're making lessvasopressin does it mean I mean it couldhave gone the other way too like they'redumping too much vasopressin into theCSF and it's not able to function in thebrainlike you know what do we know about CSFand what does it mean right well I meanit's a great question so I I think thisis just the tip of the iceberg right soI think of the CSF as as sort of likethe kitchen sink of the brain right andwhat we need is real specificity and soI mean my working hypothesis and we'lltalk a little bit about pharmacology isthat there's a deficiency in um in vasorprodu vasor pressent production inindividuals with autism but there's alot of elegant experiments that need tobe done to be able to answer thisquestion so we have funding ly to lookin um postmortem human brain tissue umto look at um in both blood CSF andhypothalamic tissue where vasopress ismade to look at inner relationshipsright which is very difficult to do butalso to see if there's a fewer number ofVaso pressent producing cells and ifVaso pressent gene expression isdiminished right because that would helpus begin to answer is this a productionissue right so if you think back to thePrairie Vthey're sort of primed to be parentalright um or in in my case the mees rightbut you can do this in any V specieswell at least the two that I'm thinkingof and you put baso pressent into thebrain and then all of a sudden it itunlocks this Behavior right so is itpossible that children with autism or atleast a subset of them um all you haveto do is replace vasopress and thatthere might be a subset of these kidsminimally that could benefit from vasorpresson replacement if you willis there any evidence for excessiveurination in kids with autism which ifanyone's going what what why is heasking that if you recall vas supressantis also anti-diuretic hormone um Isuppose the other question is could youhas anyone looked at levels of a oppressin the urine of autistic kids versusnon-autistic kids because it's actingperipherally and um you said blood drawsdon't reveal any differences um incirculating blood we know that you'reurine is filtered blood fair enough butum seems at least worth worth a lookyokay so I have this awesome medicalstudent in my lab named Lauren Clark andwe with um three different Physiciansfrom different backgrounds so um wrote aperspective piece that's currently underreview and it actually asked thisquestion so you know given all theseweird medical naming conventions it'spossible that this information isexisting in information silos indifferent disciplines right so it raisesthis idea of if you have low vasopressinso there's a if you really don't haveyou're not making vasopress you have adisorder called Central diabetesinsipidus right which is characterizedby excessive thirst um um lots ofurination um and and you know bedwedding potentially um and so what wewanted to do was ask has this beenmissed right so shouldn't there be asubset of kids with autism where wemight might be able to look at theseother physiological features and sayyeah this is the subset we want to begiving vasor pressent to and so shewrote this perspective where we did alittle bit of a review and the answerersthere's someintriguing um studies that we reviewedin this paper where it looks like andand what's funny is when you read thediscussion section it'll be like wowthere's all these kids with autism thatare drinking lots of water and we don'tknow why or wow there's a lot of bedwedding but it's not tied tointellectual disability where you mightsee a lot of bed wedding or something soall of these studies kind of raise thispoint of like wow this is reallyinteresting um and there's been no bigepidemiological study done on this andcertainly not any study where people whocome at it from brain science and thenthe the practitioners who are like anendocrinologist for instance which whichis where some of these people could showup um are are really connecting the dotsso I think that remains to be determinedbut we are actually about to launch astudy to to investigate this right I wasmeeting with Lauren yesterday about itso um it's a really good question and Ihope to have information on it in thenot to distant future as I recallalcohol is an antagonist of vasopressinso Al there's a lot of different drugsthat could interact with vasor pressentand so one thing I'm interested in isare there any drugs that release vasorpressent as a side effect and could someof them be mobilized to treat autism wealso know that like um acupuncture canrelease phaser and there's been somestudies done in Rats on that um and soone question would just be are there anyalternative therapies where we can berelacing vasor pressent naturally or dowe need to you know do a replacementstudy where we give you know intranasalvaser press into children with autismright and of course I'm I'm not I wantto say I'm not advocating that people goout and do this on their own right likeI'm I I'm a big proponent of randomizedclinical trials where you assess safetyright and efficacy yes science sciencemedicine right but I appreciate yousaying that yeah um some years ago sothis would bemid90s um there was a small but veryactive subculture that I was not a partof okay I swear um that were combiningGHB gah hydroxy butyrate um andvasopressin as um combination quoteunquote sex drugs really yes yeah um andI don't know the rationale for includingBas oppress was in any case whether ornot that's by way of enhancing socialbonding or a direct effect on sexualarousal itself is still unclear but inany event since we're talking about Basoppressing maybe you should tell usabout the actual science of uh"

            "text": "vasopressin sorry maybe I should allowyou to tell us about the actualscientific study of vasopressin um inother words what happens if you givepeople Vasa press in a controlledenvironment not the sort of environmentI'm talking about but a controll and theone thing I will say because I havepeople contact us all the time sayingwhere can I get vasor pressent and whatI would say is vasor pressen means youknow you're having effects on bloodpressure you're having effects on reallyimportant right vasod right and vas thedosing has to be appropriate you knowyou don't want people just going andtrying this because there could bereally severe adverse effects right sothat's why we've been studying this in ain a controll clinical trial right so umI teamed up with Antonio Harden who'sthe child psychiatrist that um I've beenworking with for years and we did thefirst sort of first inclass vas oppresstreatment trial in children with autismso again this was everyone was unawareof who was on basor press whether it wasthe family or the clinician who wasdoing the evaluation um and then it wasrandomized Placebo controlled um andthen we basically gave um vasor pressonagain twice a day for four weeks um tochildren they were about 6 to 12 yearsof age and then we had a primary outcomemeasure which was the socialresponsiveness scale we could get intodiscussions about what a primary outcomemeasure should be you know wouldn't itbe great if there was a biologicalmeasure um but this is sort of what hadbeen used in the past and something thatthe FDA approved us using I was partlyinterested in using the SRS because wehad used it in monkeys right and we hadshown at least in monkeys we've neverlooked at this in people because of youknow the lack of available samples butthat monkeys in this general populationthat we've looked at there's acontinuous distribution of these SRSscores that relate to the CSF vasorpress levels and so what was I wanted toknow if we use the SRS as an outcomemeasure and we're administering vasorpresson can we change you know thescoring on this instrument based on ouranimal data so SRS is social socialresponsiveness scale corre um withoutgoing into a lot of detail because wecan always refer people to the paper andI think most people just want tounderstand the top Contour um the SRSpresumably has to do with um how oftenthe kid uh interacts with another kidhow often they initiate that interactionversus on the receiving end things likeaffiliative play um how often they lookat one another versus averting gaze umthese kinds of things yeah and thenthere's also um a little bit aboutrestrictive repetitive behaviors so eventhough it's called the socialresponsiveness scale there's also anassessment of other features of autismin it but you can sort of think about itas a quantitative way to assess featuresof interest in autism and this wasrelated to our biology and the monkeysand so then we use this as this outcomemeasure um in our trial and and you knowas a as an experimentalist I have thissort of trust but verify right so youwant to you want to see the same thingover and over and over again right likescientists like repetition and so we hadParents fill out um their impressions ofwhat the child's uh Behavior was youknow before and after being on themedication we also had a clinician makean evaluation but we also had the kidsperform laboratory based tests wherethey would see like I mentioned that theum reading the mind in the eyes test orwe would show them a picture of a a faceand say what emotion is this and so wewere able to have what's called umconverg in validity right so it's afancy scientific term to say do allthese measures that we think should berelated are they related and are weseeing the same thing and um the answerwas yes so that when we gave childrenwith um autism vasopressin versus kidswith autism of placebo the kids who weretreated with vasopressin showed umincreases in Social abilities on parentreport clinician evaluation and childperformance on laboratory based testswow um was that um was that immediatelike they they did the nasal spray andthey immediately started um receivingand and initiating more socialengagement or was this a buildup overtime and what I'm getting at here iswhether or not this is the reflection ofa short or longer term neuroplasticitylike where there structural changes inthe brain or or is this something thatwas more acute um we don't know theanswer to that so we basically looked atdosing with the idea that we would youknow and and again I think we'vementioned this about um limitations onlike there's so many things that ascientist would like to do but youalways limited by a budget right and sowhen we started this work again it waslike philanthropic shoestring budgetsright and so you had to really be laserfocused on what are the things that wecan do on the budget at hand sounfortunately we didn't do like EEG orbrain Imaging or other things that wouldbe I think potentially very interestingto do because you might be able to seean early signature of response right somaybe after the first dose let's say wowlike there's some interesting changesthat are predictive of somebody whowould be a resp responder to themedication and we don't know that yet umbut we do know after this 4-week periodthat we we saw you know these changesand in then in a subset of kids weactually saw diminished anxiety and alsodiminished restricted repetitivebehaviors um so suggesting that thevasor pressent effect may not only be onum social behavior have you ever justwanted to try or tried vas oppress youknow I haven't but you're in aPsychiatry Department after all and Inot suggesting that members of thePsychiatry Department are constantlytesting the drugs that they use on theirpatients with themselves but but I'vehad several members of this departmentof which I'm a courtesy member um memberby courtesy any event and we'll see ifI'm still am after what I'm about to sayuh Dr Carl dth who's a clinician ourfirst guest on the huberman Lab podcastalso a phenomenal neurobiologyresearcher uh David Spiegel um Robmalenka umand others um that I've spoken to youknow I think all of whom said you knowthat they felt as clinicians Rob's not aclinician but anymore right but as aclinician that they felt almost aresponsibility to understand the effectsand side effect profiles of the drugsthat they were giving their patientswhich I saw not as Renegade orexperimental but rather as verycompassionate like seeking empathy um soI'm curious have you ever just snuck alittle little no no I never have butthere is a long history Medicine ofpeople trying out they believe so muchin their solution that they go andvaccinate their family with the newvaccine that they've created or they trythe medication themselves right so MDMAwas developed by Sasha kogan in alaboratory in the East Bay first by apharmaceutical company in the early1900s but then kind of disappeared itdid disappear and then it wasresurrected independently in the in the19 I think 70s and 80s and then now it'sone of the um sort of hot topics itemsfor the treatment of PTSD still in latephase clinical trials still illegal butum self-experimentation is is one of thecentral themes of Psychiatry franklyyeah I mean I guess I you know it's IPro I got in trouble in class for beingtoo social right so so I guess I'venever it might send you over the otherspot yeah yeah exactly who knows but noI I never no and the thing is is thatthese oxytocin Vasa pressin and againthese are done and this is this issomething that I think we've hit on overand over again in the podcast is youneed to know who's you're studying rightwhat's the species who's the individualyou know most of these have been done inyou know neuro I mean a lot of theoxytocin and a little bit of thevasopress work the single dose work wasmostly done in in what we'll callneurotypical people right just askingcan we move around social behavior byjust giving this single DrugAdministration most people that areneurotypical didn't say that they couldtell if they were on the drug or theplacebo right so interesting so I thinkthe question really becomes you knowdrugs have different you know they workdifferently based on the individualwho's taking them so if you have aneurotypical individual and you givethem Vaso presson you know maybe they'llself-report that they don't see adifference but if you had somebody whoisn't producing enough phas of pressonmaybe you know they would self-reportafter a period of time or maybe evenafter the first dose wow I really seesomething different right did any of thekids uh report how they felt they just"

casesone spectacular result if that you knowa kid that went from very sociallyisolated to you know maybe verygregarious and um but let's also balancethat with another outlier the the kidwith low Vasa presson who took Vasapresson who for whom there was nosignificant shift I'm presum that thedata set you probably obser somethinglike each of those yeah so I mean whatI'll say is that um so yeah I mean therewere definitely kids who didn't respondto the medication I mean one thing Ithink it's important to say and againthis was a small pilot trial right we'rein the process of replicating this in amuch larger sample so you know as ascientist again you want to say okaythis is really intriguing andinteresting and I've invested a lot inyou know this monkey model and thendoing all the CSF work in patients tosuggests that there may be a there therehere but I want to see it replicate umwe did have an article um that Stanfordmedicine I can send you the link um theythey were able to I think interview afamily that had been in the trial um andso obviously there's patient privacy andyou know you have to they have to sayit's okay to talk about it but this is afamily that was contacted I think theywere Anonymous but this is in thisreport um and they basically said thethe dad said that his son was walkingaround the he was on Vasa presson andhis son was walking around a grocerystore and he like was looking for himand he turned around and he said he wasGob smacked because his child was youknow just talking to making chitchatwith somebody like in an aisle and hesaid he had never seen that happenbefore um and so you know we do haveanecdotal reports like that and I thinkyou know the tricky part is are we wedidn't stratify anyone going into thistrial right and so the concern always isdid we get really lucky in the firsttrial and we somehow got the the quoteunquote right people that entered thetrial that we're going to be the oneswho would respond to the medication oris this a medication that has sort ofbroad use in this population and we youknow the second trial will be umpositive you used nasal spray to deliverthe vasopress and and um presumably thatgets into the blood circulation of thebrain um and supplies neurons withvasopressin but it's very non-specificand I'm not criticizing but if you thinkabout you just putting a bunch ofvasopressin into the brain and if peoplewonder why this is that it's becausebasically you have neurons of yourcentral nervous system um are part ofyour factory system and believe it ornot right behind your where your nosemeets your forehead um the brain isright there there's a little bit of boneand then the brain is is is right thereso um one of the reasons you can get inthere um and it's easier than an ocularinjection or something that wouldn't bea good approach and it's easier than aperipheral in injection into the veinbut at the same time I have to presumethat this I'm imagining this V supressjust kind of like preting through thebrain binding to whatever receptorshappen to be there you said Thereceptors areeverywhere and then this significantImprovement in social cognition right sothat raises all sorts of interestingquestions about like what are whatrelevant circuits are impacted um or isit some Global Inc could it be someglobal increase in kind of awareness ofsurroundings um although some autistickids are overwhelmed by their awarenessof surroundings so um yeah what are somethoughts about how vasopress might beworking to exert this this reallyimpressive and frankly important effectright so I mean could it increase socialmotivation does it you know like solet's talk about like how sort ofcomplexity of social um sensoryprocessing is it that were directingattention to social cues where therewouldn't have necessarily been as muchiess right um are we increasing socialmotivation which would suggest from someof the animal studies may actually behappening right um we don't know and Ithink that's partly when you have othermodels or if you're able you know to doimaging studies I mean one thing that'sbeen a little bit of a Holy Grail inthis field is that if we could get umtracers that are um basically like a youknow a molecule that would allow us toinject it into somebody and thenvisualize the brain like if I'm thinkingabout a pet trace or a radi liend whereyou could then ask questions about youknow what's happening in the brain canwe can we give vasor pressent in thecontext of a you know functional brainImaging scan and ask like where is thevasor press and binding what kind ofcircuits are involved like that needs tobe the next step of the work to knowlike where where our targets are and youyou can do something like functionalproteomics right where if you know wherebasa press and receptors are you canoverlay that with studies of functionalbrain Imaging right and that would allowyou to say these areas are dense inphasor press and receptors and do we seesimilar responses in what we call boldsignal on a on a brain scan so let'slet's be more colloquial about this likedo certain areas of the brain light upif you will where we know vasopress andreceptors are are densely distributed umin ways that we know are tied to socialmotivation or or social salience orother things that we think could bemoving the needle here um in the trialhow is this happening and and I thinkyou know one thing the reason why we didthis work is and I think it speaks towhat you said earlier is there is anurgency on the part of parents to sayyou know my child's brain is developingright and and there's a sense of thatthem you know by the sort of Westernmodel has failed a lot of people youknow they look to doctors and say whatare what are the solutions and doctorswill say well we have a limited numberof tools in the toolkit here we justdon't know right and so you know one ofthe reasons why they did that bigoxytocin study was that people weretrying to get the oxytocin anyway so itwas like let's just make sure that thisis safe let's see if it's effective andso some of our thinking was you know assoon as some of this work hits you knowlike it get and some of the work is beencovered by the media and so you know ourfeeling was we can give this intranasalum and we can do it under safemonitoring ways um and so people aregoing to think about doing these thingsanyway so let's just make sure that thisis safe and let's test this in arigorous way so we don't know the modeof action but then our feeling is isthat you know at least from the initialsafety data it looks pretty safe um andyou know and so the idea would be andthere's a long tradition in Psychiatryif we don't know the the mechanism ofaction but if we have a medication thatcan be impactful and improve the livesof people with Autism and we candiminish suffering and people can morereadily reach their full potential youknow to me it actually seems unethicalnot to move forward in a way that'sscientifically sound Amen tothat this seems like a good time to"

            "text": "raise the topic of the microbiome andnot as an unrelated topic and and here'swhy um I've seen a fair number number ofstudies in Mouse models arguing that ina mouse model of autism which nowfrankly I have to kind of wonder aboutthe the um Power of that model butanyway the models are out there in thefieldumthat fecal transplant into a host thatdoes have social deficits and rescuesome degree of social deficits I don'tknow if this has actually been done inhumans as well and for those of you thatare cringing yes they do fealtransplants in humans for treatment ofobesity and a bunch of other things umthis isn't because scientists areobsessed with feal matter it's becauseum feal matter contains a lot of themicrobiome elements um so themicrobacteria of the the of the gut umand the reason I'm raising this now isyou know one possibility and it it's notmutually exclusive with a brainmechanism is that the administration ofvasopressin somehow rescued a vasopressdeficiency in the gut so the questionsare as follows is there any evidencethat vasopress is manufactured in orimpacted by the gut microbiome of humanswe'll just start with humans since Ithink most and um because that wouldthat wouldn't be a Smoking Gun but it'be an interesting detective story wellokay so the one piece of evidence that Iwill say that I find provocative andfascinating and one thing I want to sayis I I think there's really great workdone in mice I don't want to be a mouseBasher so I want to just like sort of goon the record that I'm not bashing othermodels um if it's a conser so I thinkabout everything from like anevolutionary perspective if a mouseshares a brain structure with a humanand it's highly conserved you know Mousework can be incredibly important andvery impactful right yeah my my lab didyears of mouse work some primate workwhere necessary um now I only work onhumans um but um absolutely it has ithas its uses um but clearly the primatemodel for social um deficits as itrelates to autism you you at least haveme convinced that that one has a lot ofpower let's just say that exactly okaybut I'm going to now say there is areally cool Mouse study that was donethat I found and there's been you knowlots of different studies so there'sbeen mice so there's these like I saidthese genetically modified mice thathave genetic syndromes that are you knowwhere the individuals have socialimpairments and some of theseindividuals and again here's a here's aproblem with a field often they willmeasure oxytocin but not vasor pressinright so like they're not often bothmeasured together which I always do nowum but there's been some reallyinteresting evidence that in these Mousemodels that and and again multiplestudies but like certainly low bloodoxytocin levels in these Mouse modelswhat and and with the sense that maybethey have some sort of abnormal gutmicrobiome and then what they've done isthey've given a probiotic to these micenormalize their social functioning umand that in there's an increase inoxytocin and in a recent study alsovasopressin at the level of thehypothalamus so by giving a probioticyou I believe the oxytocin levels wereincreased in the blood you saw morespecies typical social behavior and thiswas all driven by this upregulation ofoxytocin gene expression and also vasorpressent in this very recent study andwhat's interesting is there's this nervecalled the vagus nerve which is uh it'sI think it means the wandering nervevagam it's for Vagabond yeah exactlyrightand even it's in the gut but it actuallyhas a direct projection to the nucleiand the hypothalamus where oxytocin andvasor pressent are made how interestingyes and so when you sever the Vagas youthen in this one study it's a neuronpaper um I think it's like 2020 it's asuper cool paper and then what you do isyou decrease the gene expression and youdon't see the rescue of the oxytocinlevels or the social behavior in thismodel so so another words if I interpretthis correctly and I'll go look up thepaper and provide a link to it umthey're they're by increasing thediversity of gut microbiota becausethat's really what a probiotic does sortof across the board increases thediversity of gut microbiota no onespecific ilis as I always say becausethey all seem to end in ilis you knowmultiple Iles Iles ilsy here we go againum you upregulate gene expression andthereby action of oxytocin andvasopressin in the hypothalamus butthat's a neurom mediated thing it's notas if the microbiota travel to the brainsomething changes in the gut whichactivates the vagal pathway from gut tothe specific nucleus in the brain and umwe know that the vagal pathway isinvolved because it seems at leastpartially necessary if you sever thatyou give a vagotomy then the uh thiseffect is is blunted or eliminatedthat's very interesting and and ties themicrobiome to oxy invasor Prestonproduction in a neural and somewhatcausal way um and makes the data onfecal transplants make a lot of moresense because I always wondered okay soyou take a you know taking themicrobiota from one animal putting intoanother animal you're creating you'retransferring the millu of the gut but itdoesn't say anything about mechanismright so this this is a really coolfascinating and there's also a studyI've always wanted to do is you can geta vagal nerve stimulator they used to dothem as implants right but you can alsoget one that you sort of clip onto theear and I've always wanted to ask if wewe use this in autistic individuals andyou know could we increase like can wealter social behavior right and wouldthat be something that we could actuallymeasure in the blood especially if we'reseeing this this change in these bloodlevels right are you doing thatexperiment no but I've always I've I'vealways thought it would be we we have toget you the to do that experiment andand I know a few times you've raised theissue of funding it's not something wespend a lot of time on this discussingon this podcast but I think what shouldbe abundantly clear to the listeners umthroughout the course of this episode isas you mentioned ear you're verydetermined to get work done you'llfigure out a way but the way I describeum finances and and research is thatit's absolutely necessary but it's notsufficient you of course have to havethe right people in the right lab headdirecting the work but no money no noproject and it and it is disappointingto see that despite the federal budgetfor research being um you know stillreasonable it's not what we would likeit to be um it's still very hardfor amazing worldclass Labs like yoursto say Hey you know listen there's thisvagel thing and clearly there's arationale it's not like you're pullingthis out of out of nowhere and um youwant to go do this study but what we'rereally talking about is three to fiveyears of grant writing before you couldeven initiate that study meanwhileautistic kids are going from Age 2 to 5to six these are critical windows so ifever there was a um there was arationale for um you know moving a lotof funding to uh you know I don't evencall it highrisk but you know logicallysound hypothesis testing for thetreatment of autism it's it's now so I'mI'm going to get active on on this frontso I won't get into how but you know uhwhen I get something in my uh in myneural circuits for for talking theytend to not shut down for a while wellthere will be a community that is isgoing to be immensely grateful well itseems like um the parents of these kidsand the kids themselves could greatlybenefit so um you mentioned that thefirst study on um vpress Administration"

            "text": "that saw these improvements in Socialfunctioning you said a small cohort howmany how many kids was It ultimatelythat you could use data from okay so wehad I mean you screen a lot so I thinkour you know because we had very rigidcriteria so we ended up with 17 kidsthat were on active drug and 13 thatwere on Placebo and then not a study noand the placebo CH we we always havelike a humanitarian open label extensionarm which allows for anybody who is inPlacebo can get access to the drug soboth Antonio and I feel very stronglyabout making sure that if we're doing amedication trial everybody can benefitfrom it right so afterwards if they sayokay I was in the placebo group but Ireally want the chance to try this thingthey can't but then you also get moredata we get right so I think when thefamilies are now aware that their childis on basor pressent and the cliniciansare aware you know you really wantthere's a huge Placebo response rateright and so I mean it's not a placeboresponse rate here but but we reallywould want to make sure that ourevaluation of the social behavior isdone unaware to the medication but youcan get good safety data right so so youcan have those you know 13 children whowere on Placebo we can then also makesure that their blood chemistry Labslook good that their cardiograms lookgood right and so that also allows us toassess safety parameters in a greaternumber of children in a fairly broadliterature search I was able to findokay microbiome so feal transplant issomething that people are excited aboutas weird and there are trials in peoplewith Autism ongoing in using fealtransplants okay oxytocin nasal spraypresumably still being investigated bysome groups or it's been abandoned wellI think it's mostly been abandonedbecause there's no funding prioritiesfor it right so so I know that maybe inAustralia because of Adam's positivefindings that I I don't know what hisplans are but maybe he's doing workthere um there might be a little bit ofwork with behavioral therapy andoxytocin but this is the problem whenthere's one big trial that fails thefunding just completely dries up so evenif there's promise I don't know a singlefunding agency that's going to touch itgot it um and then there's the Vasapressen Administration work that you'redoing right I think it's worthcontrasting that work with the Fairlylarge trial that was done by a majorpharmaceutical company exploring therole of vasopress in for the treatmentof autism um you could tell us what theydid because it'sbasically the opposite of what you didum and you can tell us the outcomebecause I think that if anything thatstudy um in advertently Provide supportfor the results that you observed whichis that administering let's sayincreasing Bas oppress levels in thebrain seems to um ameliorate some of thesocial deficits of autism right so um Rohad a compound called bapin which was avasopressinv1a receptor antagonist which basicallymeans there's um I think I mentionedthere's these four neuropeptidereceptors and oxytocin vas are presentbinding to each other's receptors butthe v1a receptor is the one that is ummost implicated in social behavior umand so they had and this is the trickypart about when medications aredeveloped in in Pharma versus inacademics right in academics there'sdefinitely this transparency we writegrants the abstracts are are publiclyavailable we register our trials they dotoo but a lot of the shall we say earlydevelopment is all put out inPublications right and then it's alsopeer- reviewed and there's you know anopen trail of why we're doing what we'redoing but in a pharmaceutical companyyou know they have the ability becausealso they have all the funding to beable to do all kinds of development thatmay never see the light of day becauseof the proprietary basis of it right andso you know when you go back to so it'snot it's it still is not clear to me whythey took the approach of using anantagonist to the main Vaso pressentreceptor in the brain um what'sinteresting is if you go back and youlook at the animal literature there arehamsters that if you give them vasorpresson they become aggressive right andif you give male Prairie VES vas oppress they can become aggressive butlet's think about the context thatthey're doing this in these hamstersthat show aggression are asocial theylive by themselves if you give them vasoppress and the only social repertoirethey have is to you know have sex with afemale or to fight a male that they seethey have a very limited social repright and when the Prairie V male is beis being given vasopressin it's often inthe context of PR like um protecting hismate and his offspring and so then it'sactually species appropriate for him toattack a Marauder male on his territorywho's going to you know kill his babiesright and so so my thinking in readingthe preclinical literature the animalliterature was that all right that makesa lot of sense in the context of thosespecies but we've never seen anyevidence in our Tri aggression didn'tchange we also have an aggressionmeasure in this current in the currenttrial as well but you know for me thevast majority of evidence from theanimal literature suggested that Vasapresson waspro-social um and that you knowespecially given our our CSF findingslike over and over across species acrossstudies across ages that we we should begiving vaser presson especially giventhe correlations between vaser pressonin CSF and symptom severity and autistictraits you know the former and peopleand the latter in the monkeys um and sothey had some preliminary studies that Ibelieve were maybe single dose one thatthey published um but then they had atrial where the primary outcome measurethe social responsiveness scale wasnegative and then they had um somesecondary measures that maybe showedsome promise and then they wereconducting another trial um and then dida futility analysis and I know theystopped the trial and I don't think itwas for safety reasons but again youknow a lot of this isn't made publicright because it's a pharmaceuticalcompany so you know we we will seebecause we are going to be completingour larger trial you know this year andyou know as they say the proof is in thepudding so we will see if you know wecan replicate our initial pilot findingswell sounds like they got it backwardsthat blocking vasopress Pathways wouldjust make things worse and thataugmenting Vis oppress and makes thingsbetter um although that last statementum needs to be supported by this moreextensive population well I think youknow there's been a lot of speculationand maybe there are people closer to thetrial than me who might be able to speakto mechanism but you know I would meetthe RO people at conferences and theywould come to my talks and I wouldalways ask him like what's the mechanismof action why are you antagonizing thesystem when we're giving you know a Vasapressent Agonist if you will and youknow some people had said well maybe byblocking the Vasa presson receptyou know there's a way to have oxytocinme be more bioavailable that sounds likesome gymnastics yeah yeah I totallygreat and so I've never had a I I'venever received acompelling response from anybody aboutwhy they did their trial and then youknow the differences I mean when whenthis was ongoing and you know there waspotentially room for both right um youknow maybe I thought that maybe there'ssome some optimal band of Vasa pressonsignaling in the the brain right and somaybe there's some people where theyhave too much vasopress and some whohave too little right and so this was alot of maybe but it it doesn't to meseem like that's the case especially ifour current trial has a positive rateout I'd be remiss if I didn't ask foryour stance and uh read of the landscape"

            "text": "on the data about vacines and autism I'mnot talking about covid vaccines here Iwant to be really clear about that butthere was a theory uh running about umnot just in the Press but in um thescientific literature for a while thatuh vaccines could cause autism yeah thatwas proposed um my understanding is thatwasdebunked that idea still lives on theinternet um but what is the evidence orlet let's say let's go through thissequentially what was the idea what wasthe evidence for that idea andthen what caused the demise of the theat least the scientific support for thatidea leaving open of course that newdata may come right but let's talk aboutwhat is known now right and I think whatI will say is being evidence-based is issort of like something that allscientists should strive for right andso so the the backstory on this is therewas a guy named Andrew Wakefield whopublished a paper um and he basicallysaid the preservatives and vaccines arecausing autism so not the specificvaccine but the adant the stuff that'spreserving the stuff that's keeping thethe vaccines um bio effective right atleast that was my understanding rightthat's mine as well and so and and thenit turn I want to be clear because theinternet is is a is a cruel and umdiabolical place my stance is that thatwas the hypothesis I don't agree withthat stance right okay right and so orif we want to just back up a little bitbroader there was this idea thatsomething about vaccines were causing aum autism but the study was debunked helost his medical license and the paperwas retracted right well he lost hismedical license on the basis of the factthat the study was wrong or was therethink he F the data there were that'swhy I recall as well that there wasevidence of him literally making up thedata right right so it wasn't a case oflike sloppy technique it was a case ofof intentional fraud right that's myunderstanding again what was the didanyone ever like look into what hismotivation for what what it was like whysomeone would I mean threw away hiswhole career right yeah I don't I don'tknow um but but I think the hard partabout that is understandably people gotvery frightened right that we're doingsomething to our children that couldhave you know un unanticipatedconsequences and you know when somethinglike that happens then we dump a youknow we we spend a lot of moneyinvestigating it and so the the the goodnews is at this point there have beenmultiple multiple studies that haven'tshown a correlation between you knowvaccines and autism I do believe thepreservatives have been changed as aresult so that's something we shouldcheck um that you know that might besomething where you know there's been apublic health change on preservativesthat are in vaccines that's interestingin its own right I mean we don't want tocause alarm if um but that's that'sinteresting you know that that in thisdata fraud case it might have cuedpeople to the idea that certain thingsmight have been um needing change eventhough it wasn't the specific issue thatthis uh this fraudulent researcher wasfocused on the change was made to makesure people would vaccinate theirchildren right like so this is somethingthat I think we should have lots ofcaveats here like you know post the postthe studies like make sure that whatwe're saying is accurate right but I butI think that my concern is that we'vespent you know so the good news is thatyou know the Maj like every single studythat I'm aware of does not not show arelationship between vaccination andautism right and so I think that mostscientists and medical doctors that Iknow that are part of like the you knowstandard biomed research Community donot believe the vaccines cause autismthey vaccinate their own children youknow they recommend vaccinations toother people's children um and and so Ithink that's where we are um you knowcould I just ask a question um uh and Ifeel more than obligated to do thisbecause I I don't you know I think Ihave a pretty good finger on the pulseof the listenership of this podcast butI think there's a range of of stances onthis um where some people um have a lotof trust in the standard medicalestablishment others have less righttrust in the standard medicalestablishment and I wouldn't be doing myjob if I didn't try and represent um allthose sides um and you know one thingthat I've heard okay is that over thelast 20 or 30 years there's been adramatic increase in the number ofvaccinations that kids get and I don'tknow if that's true but when we sayvaccinations we could be talking aboutyou know measles Mom's forella right umpolio um we could also be talking aboutmeasles bumps forbell polio flu shotsevery year rabies vaccine technisvaccine H HPV right with one that wasn'teven available when I was in in collegeyou know as a everyone in college waswas well aware there wasn't an HPVvaccine um didn't change people'sbehavior a whole lot but umyouknow there's there's a vaccine there'smultiple vaccines and then there's youknow all the vaccines yeah right and Ithink that one of the concerns that Ihear about um is the idea that okaythere's some critical vaccines but thenwhich ones are perhaps less critical ifany um and these are the kinds ofdiscussions that are starting to surfaceum and that you know have parents andpotential parents you know rightfullythinking about this stuff and and no onereally knows where to get theinformation but like I'm I I've triedand I can't find a pediatrician thatsays Hey listen these but not those oryou can certainly find board certifiedPhysicians that say many and certainboard certified Physicians that say noneyou actually can find those um the nonecategory tend to hide themselves alittle bit more than others for obviousreasons but it's hard to get a sense oflike which which vaccines are criticaland which ones aren't if you're a parentand you're not versed in this stuff andso you could imagine that like peopleare you know kids are taking many morevaccines and only some of those arecritical or maybe all of them arecritical well I think I guess the way Iwould maybe turn it on its head is thatyou know because ofthis this study that did in some ways somuch harm right like we SPI study wespent I I I don't even want to Hazard aguess about how much money worldwidewent into studying you know the the youknow vaccine and autism based on afraudulent data right like that's to mea real tragedy but at the time theydidn't know it was fraudulent exactly sothey went after this thinking it wastrue okay but I think I think the thingthe consequence of all this that I thinkis also extremely sad is thateverybody because everyone got so riledup and so fearful there has beenhistorically until recently manyresearchers who were like oh man I don'twant to touch IM mology and autism witha 10-ft pole right and yeah you know andI I wouldn't consider myself Fearlessbut like my lab never had any reason towork on those yeah on those importantproblems but I'll tell you like it seemslike a it's not a kettle of fish it'sit's a ball of barbed wire with a bunchof you know Napalm burning around it andyou know I mean you say one thing youryour career is ending you say theopposite thing your career is alsoending you know it's it it's it's a it'sa mess but but I think this highlightsthat there are so many parents you knowagain and I think we need to listen toparent stakeholders right like you knowthere's there needs to be a dialoguewhenever anybody's studying any illnessto to talk to the people who areinvolved right and and I think thatthere are parents who will report wowlike there are there is immune systemdisregulation in my child and butbecause of this historical issue withvaccines it's only been very recentlythat I think people scientists medicaldoctors have said okay we're hearing alot about this from parents and arethere a group of individuals who haveyou know um immune issues that could bedriving their autism right we don't knowand everything should be evidence-basedbut I think that like you said with thiscancel culture and all this fearscientists sometimes will pick topicsvery judiciously based on you know likehey I just want to be left in peace andI'm trying to help this community and ifthere is areas of the Enterprise thatyou think are going to cause all kindsof grief then people are going to beless reluctant to study them even ifit's critically needed well that's a aperfect place to say thank you I realizeyou're not addressing the vaccine autismissue directly but you're so clearlygoing after the target trying to figureout what are the biological mechanismsthat are disrupted in autism and byextension other deficits of socialfunction in kids and adults you'veidentified this incredible relationshipbetweenvasopress which should have moreprominence in my opinion than oxytocinits lesser cousin just kidding oxytocinlovers um but also have shown you knowyes in a small study but you're nowextending this to a larger cohort as youmentioned uh a causal relationship whenB oppress is administered to these lowvasopress SL low social functioning kidstheir symptoms improve so I I know Ispeak for many people when I say that umI truly appreciate your doggedness in ingoing after this problem especially onthe complicated landscape of lack offunding for doing novel and trulyhigh-risk work um especially on thebackdrop of the sociopolitical landscapearound autism it's a complicated thingeven to discuss you know as I mentionedin the introduction you know we had tohave some fluency around autism so wesometimes said autistic sometimes wesaid people with Autism you know I meanit's a it's a tough one but in order tomake progress real progress in this areawe need people like you we need you andyou're doing it to get in there and justgo okay you know let's get at thebiological functions let's get at thenovel treatments and you're makingamazing progress so I'm so grateful thatyou're doing it and that you'll continueto do it and that you came here today umto teach us what you've been up to umI'm oh so grateful and I just want tosay thank you for that and that weabsolutely have to get you back here uhto give us an update on your progressreally soon and and again and again andagain thank you so much I love beinghere all

We discuss the biology of social connections and bonding in babies, children and adults. Dr. Parker explains our current understanding of autism and autism spectrum disorders: what they are, why the incidence of autism has increased so dramatically in recent years and both the current and emerging treatments for autism. We also discuss the condition formerly called \u201cAsperger\u2019s.\u201d This episode ought to be highly relevant for anyone interested in child and human development, how social bonds form, and to those curious about autism and other spectrum conditions.\nFor show notes, including referenced articles and additional resources, please visit hubermanlab.com.\nThank you to our sponsors\nAG1: https://drinkag1.com/huberman\nEight Sleep: https://eightsleep.com/huberman\nLMNT: https://drinklmnt.com/huberman\nAeroPress: https://aeropress.com/huberman\nInsideTracker: https://insidetracker.com/huberman\nMomentous: https://livemomentous.com/huberman"
