            "text": "to have you here uh your career bothpublic facing and academic career havecovered an enormous range of topics sowe have a lot to cover look who'stalking um and anytime uh two professorssit down or even one Professor um sayswe have a lot to cover I think everyonelistening braces themselves like oh nobut these topics uh I assure everyoneare of the utmost interest and you coverthem in such both fabulous detail andyou make it very clear so I'm reallylooking forward to this I'd like tostart off by talking about somethingthat I'm obsessed by and I know a lot ofpeople are obsessed with and strugglewith and I know you also have a recentpublication on this topic which isprocrastination I am a bit of aprocrastinator but a different way ofstating that is that I love deadlines Ilearned in college that I love love lovedeadlines because it seems to harmharness my focus and my attention I likejust enough I guess you call it anxietyor autonomic arousal for the you knowNeuroscience or physiology orientedfolks for me just bringsabout a total elimination of all of thedistractors and it seems to both slowand accelerate my perception of time andit seems to bring out my best to havedeadlines but I would prefer to not haveto procrastinate and in order toself-impose deadlines I prefer thatother people impose those deadlines infact so what do we know aboutprocrastination why do some peoplecomplete things well in advance why doother people procrastinate is it thatthey're seeking deadlines as I believe Iam andinterestingly and sort of alluding tothis recent paperviewers what is the relationship betweenprocrastination and creativity I feellike we should just deal with all thatlaterlet's put it off no good one uh by theway there's extra credit for sciencefunds on here so wa done one of the bestarticles on procrastination ever writtenwas titled at last my article onprocrastination fantastic I love it yeahit just made me smile um so I think thethe the basic question I think to startwith is why do we procrastinate and I Ithought I was immune actually when Icame into this topic uh I was the theperson who annoyed my college roommatesby finishing my thesis a couple monthsearly uh I found out there was a termfor me I'm a precrastinator uh so theyou know the focus and the pressure thatyou get from a deadline I get that themoment the project starts um andsometimes months or years in advance andso I was really proud of finishingeverything early and then I discoveredthere are things that I procrastinate ontoo uh which was a little bitdisappointing are you willing to sharewhat some of those I am uh so I um Iprocrastinate on any that'sadministrative uh so I'm right therewith you you want to get time on mycalendar it could take me weeks torespond you asked me a question aboutsocial science I will be back to you ina minute um I procrastinate on gradingtakes me forever uh I basically put offa whole bunch of tasks that I thoughthad nothing in common it turns out thatI procrastinate when I'm bored likeboredom is I guess it's probably my mosthated emotion and so I will do anythingto avoid a boring task and I think thisgoes to why people procrastinate whichis a lot of people think it's lazinessor you're not disciplined enough butactually the the research on this isreally clear that you're not avoidingwork when you procrastinate in fact alot of ourprocrastination is is focused on doingthings that involve a lot of energyyou've seen people probably clean theirentire houses when they're putting off atask um so it's it's not that you'rebeing lazy it's that you're avoidingnegative emotions that a task stirs upso for me it's boredom uh for a lot ofpeople it's fear or anxiety uh I don'tknow if I can pull this off uh I have anextreme case of impostor syndrome inthis role um the the challenge in frontof me is too daunting um for some peopleit's confusion I haven't figured it outyet and so like I can't work on thisbecause I I feel like I'm stuck um sowhat's I guess the big question for youthen Andrew is what's what's the emotionthat causes you toprocrastinate you know it's hard for meto identify the stick here I think of itmore as the carrot that comes withdeadlines and again I I don't considermyself a procrastinator per se I justreally love deadlines andprocrastination is a terrific way tosimulate the deadline uh so for me soyou wait so you delay starting orfinishing a task in order to have a asense of time pressure that's right itbuilds a certain amount of internalarousal in me to know okay I've got 72hours to complete something and it's nowgame time I like the game time beforethe game time before a podcast I'll putin anywhere from you know several daysto weeks or even months in preparationso it's really elastic depending on thetopic but when it came to exams inschool or if it comes to writingdeadlines um I consider the the shippingof the product or the presentation ofthe live event that I happened to bedoing as the second game or event thefirst event is the pressure and theexcitement of getting into the groove ofdoing focused work because for me that'ssuch a drug I mean it feels like allhaving all the systems of my brain andbody oriented towards one specific thingis just sheer Bliss for me so it soundslike then you're you're actually not a achronic procrastinator thank you I'venever that's never been uh the way Iviewed myself but now I'll I'll I'lltake that it's a strategy for you it isa strategy that's right and ient youknow I was fairly Wayward youth barelyfinished high school Etc so by time Igot serious about school which was mysecond year ofUniversity when deadlines were presentedlike there's an exam there's a midtermexam on a given date that was excitingto me that was exciting I was like okaythat's the big thing that's myopportunity to to prove myself to myselfbecause I was really coming from behindand then the opportunity to or I shouldsay the the feeling of dropping intothat Groove like this is the excitingpart is the preparation you knowlikewise with podcasting for our solopodcast I love the research as much as Ilove presenting the material maybe moremaybe more right likewise for Universitylectures or for traveling and givingseminars as a traditional academic I'msure you're familiar with that rightit's it's the preparation is where yourealize it's almost like I I think of itas somebody like like a minor in a mineand just finding a gem and of coursethere then there are all the thoughts ofwhat you can do with that later andyou're going to show people it has acertain value to the world Etc but butit's the the searching and finding thosegems that is like even as I talk aboutit I feel like my body's going to floatout of the chair a little bit I I havethe same experience it's the it's thethe sort of the Unleashed curiosity andthen the rush of Discovery and by thetime you're teaching it or explaining itbut I already know this like I'm notlearning anything anymore and yes I'mexcited to share it and I hope it'shelpful to other people so you know Ithink as as you talk about what yourprocess looks like I don't even thinkwhat you do qualifies as procrastinationtechnically seem to getting better andbetter I me seriously if if you thinkabout how procrastination is is definedit's it's delaying despite an expectedcost and you don't think there's a costyou actually see a benefit that's rightand I've tried starting that's notprocrastination that's just delay yeahI've tried starting things earlier andum and I should say that my processoften begins much earlier than thephysical process like if I was beingobserved in an experiment be okay youknow Andrew is finally sitting down towrite this book chapter or you knowfinally sitting down to research somepapers for an episode but I'm thinkingabout it all the time yeah I mean muchto the dismay of people in my life youknow I'm I'm I'm constantly thinking"

            "text": "about these things I mean walking totake out therecycle I'll have ideas and then I'llwrite them down I constantly writingthings down voice memos into my phone Ihave a method of capture where Ibasically try and just grab everythingand then filter out what's useful do youhave a process like that for forgleaning ideas a little bit I do now soum when when gin and I started thisresearch on procrastination she had shehad come to me she was a very creativedoctoral student and she said I have mybest ideas when I'mprocrastinating and it was it was one ofthose moments where I didn't believe herbut I thought it was an interestingenough idea that it was worth exploringand I said show me like get let's getsome data let's see if we can we cantest this and she ended up um Gatheringdata in a Korean company where shesurveyed people on how often theyprocrastinate and then got theirsupervisors to rate their creativity andsure enough found that people whoprocrastinate sometimes were rated asmore creative than people who rarely dolike me theprocrastinators and I remember askingher what about the chronicprocrastinators and she's like I don'tknow they never filled out mysurvey yeah as I recall from that paperthere's inverted u-shaped function withprocrastination on the vertical axis andand um uh and creativity on thehorizontal axis flipped sorry okay so umexplain to me then the relationshipbetween procrastination and creativityYeah so basically the the peak ofcreativity is in the middle ofprocrastination ah okay got it and yeahthere's a there's an upside down U curvethere and so then I thought this wasfascinating so then you know we go intothe lab to say can we replicate this canwe control it in an experiment and thehardest part of that was how do yourandomly assign people to procrastinatelike to my knowledge never been donebefore and we eventually figured outthat we could give people a bunch oftask to do and then temp them withhighly entertaining YouTube videos uhthat were sort placed on their screenand we put different numbers of YouTubevideos there so that uh you know ifthere's only one you're not tempted toprocrastinate much if there are fouryou're probably going to get sucked intoa little bit of a YouTube spiral ifthere are eight uh you might be puttingoff the task that's much less excitingthan than you know watching JimmyKimble's Mean Tweets for example andthis was done in a fairly naturalisticenvironment for these folks people arepeople are on in a computer they'rethey're asked to you know to solve somecreative problems that look prettysimilar to what you might do in your joband then we're going to score yourcreativity later and um it turned outthat the people who were attempted toprocrastinate moderately um ended upgenerating the most creative ideas sowhy is that um there are a couple thingsthat happen and you have to look at bothsides of the curve so what's wrong withthe procrastinators and also whathappens to the the extremeprocrastinators um and in both caseswhat happens is um you end up with alittle bit of tunnel vision so um when Idive right into a task I'm stuck with myfirst ideas and I don't wait long enoughto incubate and get my best ideas um I'mless likely to reframe the problem I'mless likely to access remote knowledgebecause I'm just I'm just diving rightin and meanwhile The Chronicprocrastinators um end up in the sameboat because they don't get starteduntil the last minute and so they haveto rush ahead with the easiest idea toimplement as opposed to reallydeveloping the most novel idea andmeanwhile the the people in the middlewho you know are starting to feel thatpressure of like wow I you know I kindof Spun my wheels for 10 minuteswatching a bunch of YouTube videos I'mrunning out of time for this task theystill have enough time to work on theideas that were active in the back oftheir minds and and that gives them ashot at more novel ideas so I've triedto adopt this to answer your questionI've tried to adopt this as my processnow to say I will still dive into aproject ahead of schedule but I will notcommit to an idea until I've let itincubate for a few weeks and I'm workingon other things whereas an earlierversion of me like when I'd sit down towrite a book um soon as I had the bookidea I would start writing on day onenow I have the idea I file it away and Igive myself at least a month before Ibegin drafting um and I think it feelsless productive but it's far morecreative what are your thoughts aboutsome of what you described being anunconscious way of seeding the mind andthe unconscious within idea so forinstance uh let's take a a Schoolacademic scenario where um students getan assignment and the assignment iscontain within a folder and it just saysassignment okay and it's a doe on aparticular date and it says do on thatparticular date and they're given thefolder but they have no sense of whatthe assignment is you can imagine onecategory of procrastinator that willtake that thing and put it down andavoid looking at it entirely versusanother category of procrastinator thatwill Flip Flip it open and take a lookat okay this is going to be an essay onyou know um I don't know something abouteconomic theory in the late 1700s closeit and thenprocrastinate there is an idea which Ifrankly I subscribe to a little bit umbecause we recently did this series onMental Health not Mental Illness butmental health with Dr Paul kti where hetalked extensively about the unconsciousand how the unconscious mind is alwaysworking with ideas things that we areconcerned about performance these sortsof things even if we're not aware ofthem um what what are your thoughtsabout the creativity that seeded byslight procrastination being related toactually knowing what you'reprocrastinating on specifically I Ithink it turns out to be I don't want tosay essential butcritical so one of the things we foundis in order for moderate procrastinationto fuel creativity you have to beintrinsically motivated by the thingyou're procrastinating on interestingand so what what happens is if if you ifyou're bored for example by the topicyou're not going to open the folderyou're not going to start thinking aboutit at all it's not going to begin you'renot going to do any subconsciousprocessing you're not going to have anyunexpected connections um between thistopic and something else you've learneduh learned about or been curious aboutif you're interested in the problem thenwhen you put it off you're much morelikely to still keep it active in theback of your mind and that's when whenyou begin to to see you know I I imagineyou could explain the biology of this umI I imagine for example there's umthere's probably um there are probablymore neural networks um that areconnecting um You probably get you getaccess to ideas that previously wouldhave been um sort of separate nodes andso I think that you you want to knowwhat the topic is right you don't wantto just see the blank assignment but youalso have to find a reason that this isexciting to you um otherwise you'regoing to avoid it as opposed to lettingitpercolate that brings us to the topic ofintrinsic motivation um and I'd like to"

            "text": "link that up with the topic ofperformance so when I was in universityuh there were many topics that I wasexcited to learn about some more thanothers of course um but occasionally I'dbe in a class or I'd get an assignmentthat frankly I had minimal interest innever zero but minimal interest and as away of dealing with that I embarked on aprocess of literally lying to myself andjust telling myself okay I'm superinterested in reading this and I'm goingto force myself to be interested inreading it and lo and behold I wouldstart falling in love with certainthings maybe he was was even the um youknow the arrival of a word that I didn'trecognize and then I would go look it upand I knew I was studying for the gr atthat time so I file that away I stillhave my notebooks of all the vocabularywords that I learned in the course of myuniversity courses that frankly made theverbal portion of the GRE pretty easyyou know which if you ever try and studyfor that at the end it's pretty tough tocommit all those new words to uh tomemory and context so I could findlittle hooks and and through those hooksI could kind of Ratchet my way into alarger interest and then lo and beholdI'm really interested in Greek mythologyyou know or that actually like that oneat first but um I didn't have to trickmyself but you know maybe we could spenda little bit of time talking about whatis true intrinsicmotivation is it alwaysreflexive uh can we make ourselvesintrinsically motivated about a giventopic or scenario or group of people uhand then let's talk about how intrinsicmotivation links to Performance becausethere's a rich literature on this as Irecall and I remember you know theStanford study of rewarding kids forthings they were already in motivated todo maybe we could touch on that a littlebit and remind people who haven't heardabout it but I'm fascinated by thistopic because I feel like so much oflife is about doing things thatinitially we don't feel that excited todo yeah and yet succeeding in life youknow until you can afford to offloadyour uh administrative work to somebodyelse which hopefully by by now you havefind a way to get it done right uh thisis fundamental to being a functionalhuman being frankly not just successfulin air quotes but functional we got todo stuff that we don't enjoy doing yeahso I think we we can talk about a coupledifferent ways to nurture intrinsicmotivation we could think about how thetask itself is designed we can thinkabout reward systems and then we canthink about also the things we say toourselves and others which I hope arenot lies but rather U persuasiveattempts uh let's let's start on thatone actually I I don't know a lot ofpeople who are that good at deliberateself-deception well well I like to thinkit was only around a particular set ofuh goal motivated Pursuits um but atthat time for me also was survival as Imentioned I didn't do well in highschool I really wanted to perform wellin University but I knew that workingjust for the grade wasn't going to carryme it was it it feltcatabolic um and I don't know maybe I atthat age I was still in the window ofheightened neuroplasticity we know itnever closes but um but I think I alsofell in love with the process oflearning how to do what I just describedyeah so I think for most people the bestmethod of self-persuasion is actually toconvince somebody else uh so I'mthinking of Elliot Aronson's classicresearch on cognitive dissonance wherehe would he would ask you to go and tellsomebody else a task you hated is reallyinteresting and if he paid you a lot todo it you still hated the task becauseyou had a justification like I got 20 toyou know to kind of FIB a little bitabout this task um you know the task isbad but I did it for the for the paymentwhen he paid you $1 to go and tellsomebody that you loved a task that youdidn't you ended up liking it more wowand maybe I shouldn't be surprised butmaybe you should tell me why I shouldn'tbe surprised because I hope people gotwhat you just said very clearly and ifthey didn't if you don't like doingsomething going and reporting tosomebody else how great that thing is solying about it to somebody else um isone way to increase the degree to whichyou like or enjoy that behavior or topicand if you're paid $20 to go lie tosomebody in the positivedirection so against your true beliefit's less effective in shifting yourunderlying AFF effect about that thingyour emotions than if you're paid lesscorrect yeah exactly now I thinkobviously in the experiment lying was aneasy way to to show the effect but inreal life I think that way that you wantto apply this is to say all right I'vegot to find something about this taskthat's interesting to me and then in theprocess of explaining it to somebodyelse I'm going to convince myselfbecause I'm hearing the argument fromsomebody I already like andtrust and I've also chosen I've chosenthe the reasons that I find compellingas opposed to hearing somebody else'sreasons and so I think this this goes tothe point that you were making which isif if you're trying to to find a hook tomake a topic intriguing um you've got tofigure out okay what is it that wouldmake this fascinating to me and you in alot of cases what you're looking for isa curiosity Gap um I think socialscientists like to talk about curiosityas an itch that you have to scratch umso there's something you want to knowand you don't know it yet so I would sayI I tell my students often like takeyour least favorite class and find amystery or a puzzle like something thatyou you just do not know the answer toum like I actually I've talked with ourkids about this like what what reallyhappened to King TD do you know can youget to the bottom of that and all of asudden you're like I wonder I need toGoogle it and then I need to see ifWikipedia has credible information onthis and the more you learn about thatthe more intriguing it becomes and Ithink that's that's the beginning of theprocess of of finding intrinsicmotivation I seeso inherent in your answer is the ideathat there's something wired into ourneural circuits and thereforepsychology that Curiosity as a verbthe act of being curious and seekinginformation where well and I should sayI Define curiosity and I hopefullyyou'll disagree with me or agree eitherway it doesn't matter as long as we canget a bit deeper understanding I Definecuriosity as a desire to find somethingout where you are not attached to aparticular outcome yes is that rightyeah I I in Psychology is typicallydefined as just wanting to know and thatmeans you're driven by the question nota particular answer which is exactlywhat you're driving at okay great so andI think it Dorothy Parker that said umthe cure for boredom is curiositythere's no cure for curiosity as therethere shouldn't be a care for curiosityright so um and by the way folks wedon't know what neural circuits subservecuriosity in the brain it's it's a gotto be a distributed Network there's nobrain area for curiosity but it's got tobe linked up with the reward systems ofdopamine Etc in some way because whenone discovers something new thatsatisfies some curiosity it's clearlythere's a there's a internal rewardthere okay let me back up so if yourchild or an adult"

because they like spending theirpaycheck probably more than I you knowI'm not intrinsically attached to moneyI mean I certainly have needs in in lifebut but I don't enjoy spending money forthe sake of spending it or for gainingmore possessions but I know people thatdo and I certainly don't judge um arethey somehow existing in a um in adiminished landscape of happiness or orbecause they seem pretty happy to me uhbut they seem to have also worked outthis relationship they do certain thingsto get the extrinsic rewards and theyreally enjoy what they can do with thoseextrinsic rewards there's a so there's ahuge body of evidence on what are theeffects of extrinsic rewards onmotivation and performance and I thinkthe latest conclusions if you look atthe the latest meta analyses so you knowhuge study of studies trying toaccumulate like what's the averageeffect of adding a financial incentiveto a task that wasn't incentivizedbefore or to a job where you know youwere paid salary and now we're going togive you incentive compensation um thereis a boost so in general um people areare more productive when they'reincentivized for their output but umthese incentives are better for uh formotivating quantity than quality so yousee people get more done but they're notnecessarily more careful or morethorough are they less careful and lessthorough no um actually they're there'sstill positive effects on averagethey're just weaker um and of course youcould then start to say well how do Iincentivize you know being fast andcareful um but I think where where we dohave to be really cautious is um there'san undermining effect of extrinsicrewards on intrinsic motivation and youwere you were alluding to this earlierdating back to the early 70s where weknow that if we take an interesting taskand then we pay you for it you mightconclude that you're only doing it forthe outcome and you lose interest in thetask so the the classic demonstrationMark leper and colleagues is kidsplaying video games and they're umthey're playing them because they're funand then you start to add in anincentive and then when the incentive istaken away they don't want to playanymore because the meaning of the taskhas changed and now I'm doing it becauseI want to get something out of it asopposed to I love theprocess I think that that um thatphenomenon um does not have to exist sowe know for example at work um ifmanagers uh as long as they give peopleautonomy um they don't present therewards in a controlling way um soinstead of saying you know Andrew inorder to earn this you need to do thefollowing work uh if they say hey lookyou know I'd really love it if you youknow if you would deliver the followingum and in order to make that worth yourwhile I'm offering this incentive peoplereact very differently when they have asense of choice and control um so Ithink that that's I guess the startingpoint in the presence of autonomy Idon't I don't think there's a majordownside of of extrinsic rewards I thinkyou also have to be careful that um yeahI guess that you're not over justifyingthe task in other words you're not umyou're not swamping people's intrinsicreason for doing it but you're adding areason to try it so actually um if we ifwe go to a different domain for a secondso um look at kids who don't want to eattheir vegetables extrs and incentivesare very effective to get kids to tryvegetables for the first time but thenthe hope is that they discover avegetable or two that they don't mindand then they find reasons to keep doingit um and I think that that's how I wanta lot of rewards to work I don't thinkthat rewards should be carrots that wedangle to try to control people'sbehavior I think they should be symbolsof how much we appreciate and value aparticular behavior and if you framethem that way it's a lot easier forpeople to say yeah you know what I'mthat that reward is something that Ireally want but I'm I'm not only doingthe task for that reward yeah that thatyou basically answered the question Iwas going to ask which is and you knowat risk of sounding new Agy um but weare sitting in California umI could imagine that when one is focusedon the extrinsic rewards so a physicaltask or a cognitive task for an exicreward if I'm focusing on the exicreward I'm also air quotes again notpresent right I'm I'm thinking about theoutcome I'm not thinking about processand I think there's perhaps you canflesh out some of what this is exactlybut I think there's a fairly extensiveum data to support the idea that when weare physically and mentally present tothe task that we're going to performbetter and presumably our our umintrinsic liking of that task orperforming that task increases as wellis that true yeah I think so I think soif we want to break down the mechanismsfor why intrinsic motivation is usefulfor for performance um one you touchedon earlier it's focus of attention umyou're it's much easier to find flowwhen you're intrinsically motivated youget into that state of deep absorptionwhere uh time melts away so youmentioned you know sort of eitherspeeding up or slowing down your yoursense of time you forget where you aresometimes you even lose track of youridentity and you're just you're justmerged into the task uh and so that thatthat concentration is helpful there'salso a greater persistence effect thatwhen you enjoy what you're doing you'reless likely to give up in the face ofobstacles uh you're more likely to thinkabout it when you're not doing the taskand come up with great ideas and so umyou know I think there's there's aworking harder there's a working longerthere's a working smarter and there'salso a thinking more clearlyeffect this is a uh brief but relatedtangent one of the things that I'vefound incredibly difficult in recentyears is that um you know most of mylife really since I was a small kid Iwas forging for things and then you knowI used to give lectures on Monday inclass if they let me until theyeventually stopped me about the stuff Iwas reading about all weekend so got anearly start in the the professorial umfront but now if I'm reading somethingand I discover a what I think is areally really valuable piece ofinformation or a tool or a protocol I'mlike wow this is really cool thesefindings are oh so cool there's aproblem which is that now I have anopportunity to cast that out to theworld through social media we all dothis could be wait I'm sorry you're onsocial media um from time to time Iyou're all over my feet uh you and and Iboth do our own social media by the waywhich I really appreciate I think onecan always detect if if someone else ishandling someone's Social Media so yesI'm on social media and and I love thatI have the opportunity to both um sendout ideas and information and alsoreceive feedback I really love thecomment section um and always encouragecomments I learn from it uh frankly loveis a strong word I learn from it youknow and and you and I were weaned inthe academic culture where frankly thethe kind of hazing that that onereceives in academic culture is verydifferent than the kind of hazing thatone receives on social media but umlet's just say that if you come upthrough Academia you develop a prettythick skin um I agree I I do have to saythough that there there was a part of methat was really surprised when I startedposting on social that I love I loveconstructive criticism I was unpreparedfor the number of people who willknee-jerk criticize a study without evenlooking at whether the methods arerigorous right I'm like come on if Iposted this surely it's at least worthconsidering the possibility that there'sstrong evidence behind it right wellthat's where a uh a um a brief uh Iwanton to call it a rhetoric but aresponse of you know um youknow clearly should read the studyfurther because I think you'll besatisfied with the answer or something Idon't know um but I agree it it can be alittle bit harsh in there sometimes butyou know the social media uh channelsare I think have you know they have it'sa double-edged blade um they obviouslyhave their issues but um can be awonderful opportunity to shareinformation and share it quickly theproblem is that it takes me out of whatI was doing initially which was learningsearching for those gems with with whichto share later and I think there's abroader landscape to consider this wherepeople for instance are uh I was at thebeach yesterday it was just absolutelyspectacular day at the beach uhespecially for this time of year andeveryone was taking pictures of thatexperience on their phone and probablysharing that experience either socialmedia or with friends um this is verydifferent than taking a photograph andnot seeing that photograph until lateror not sending it out and so there arenow near infinite number ofcircumstances where we are taken out ofthe rewarding experience I shouldrephrase that we are taking ourselvesout of the rewarding experience andfocusing on a different rewardingexperience that I think by definition isan extrinsic reward so we are takingourselves out of our intrinsicallyrewarding experiences and activatingthese extrinsic rewards and do you thinkin any way that's undermining ourexperience of things that we reallyenjoy um again not to demonize socialmedia or these channels but um I'vepersonally found it difficult to refrainfrom sharing this knowledge I'm soexcited to share but I deliberatelydelay and there's a lot I have a deeplist of folders full of things that Iwant to post but I'm just doing it youknow systematically over time because Ireally fight the temptation to to dothis mostly because I want to continueto enjoy this learning process and thisseeking process so much yeah I I feelthe same the same um I feel torn I thinkI think it was eie white who said uh I I"

doI show up on time for you or do I meetyour criteria the the um the explanationI wasting getting my morning sunlightand therefore I'm X number of minutes oreven hours late would have beencompletely fine I figured as much that'sthat's a built-in acceptable excuse withyou I think I mean I think everybodyexperiences a version of this and umit's definitely gotten worse with uhwith social media and with smartphonesum I think so one of the the moststartling data points for me was umGloria Mark first put this on my radaruh before covid the average person waschecking email 72 times a dayhow do you ever concentrate for morethan a couple minutes if you're self-interrupting that often you can't umbriged Shelty has a great term for thisshe she calls it time confetti and shesays we're taking these meaningfulblocks of time and we're slicing them upinto these like tiny little dots ofconfetti and uh not only can we notaccomplish anything uh we're alsoeroding our own sense of Joy um becauseit's really hard to enjoy the you knowthe 30- second blip of time that you geton a testum and I think we know a lot more aboutthe existence of these problems thanthan how to solve them but one thing wedo know is blocking out un interruptedtime is Meaningful uh there's a greatLeslie Perlo experiment where she takesengineers and she has them uh she sets aquiet time policy no interruptionsTuesday Thursday Friday before noon 65%above average productivity could yourepeat the um the protocol again yeah soquiet time there are a couple iterationsof it but I think the most effective onewas Tuesday Thursday Friday no meetingsno interruptions no slack no emailsbefore noon and during those periods ofno interruptions one could tend towhatever their primary purpose is atwork yeah so for me it might bepodcasting obviously I don't have myphone in here and never do um but itdoesn't mean no interaction with anyoneelse it just means focusing on the majortask the task exactly and you come inwith a clear sense of priority andpurpose and I don't think there'sanything magical about 2 Thursday Fridaybefore noon uh it's just the idea ofsetting a boundary and collectivelycommitting to it that that seems to beimportant and I think you know I when Ithink about this uh I'd be I'd be reallycurious about your take on um onchronotypes here because I think onething I've learned in the last coupleyears is that if you're a if you're amorning person um you do your bestanalytical and creative thinking in themorning and so the quiet time blockwould work very well for for me as amorning person if you're a night owl youprobably want that block in the lateafternoon and I was encouraged therethere was some evidence during Co thatuh people have their best meetings rightafter lunch uh that there something like30% less likely to multitask in an afterlunch meeting uh and I guess you knowyou could probably unpack the like thefood coma uh you know gettingre-energized by other people but it'sled me to wonder if we should all beprotecting the first few hours in thelast few hours of the day for deep workand then doing our core meetings andinteractions and kind of off taskactivities in the middle what do youthink about that as a sequence yeah wellI have a lot of questions about this foryou but um I love that sequence itcertainly fits with my natural rhythms II think there's ample evidence tosupport the fact that provided one issleeping well at night and is on a moreor less a standard schedule when I saystandard I mean going to bed somewherebetween let's say 9:30 and 11:30 p.m.waking up sometime between let's say um6:00 a.m. and 8:00 a.m. maybe 5:30 or7:30 um some something like that so nothighly unusual Night Owl or super earlybird um for people that are followingthat sort of schedule the first let'sjust say from zero to eight hours afterwaking there tends to be a a fairlyrobust increase in all the catamin sodopamine norepinephrine epinephrinewhich generally okay generally speakinguh lead to increases alertness attentionand focus that are great for analyticwork uh great for implementation ofstrategies that you already understandand you need to churn through a lot ofstuff um and of course there's a bigincrease in the morning especially ifyou view morning sunlight a healthyincrease I should say in cortisolcortisol is not bad folks you you wantcortisol but you want that Peak early inthe day we know that okay so um for mostpeople it seems at least myunderstanding is that um that period oftime 0 to eight or uh eight hours afterwaking or so um is best devoted to thequote unquote most critical tasks butone of the common problems is thatpeople take that um ability to implementa known strategy and they startbattering back all the emails or talkingto all by the way talking to co-workersis great and it's often required butit's what the question is whether or notit's productive conversation or whetheror not it's just conversation and wetend to have a lot of energy early inthe day and I'm I'm obsessed with theidea of neural energy as opposed to justcaloric energy um so there we're talkingabout neural energy and then post postlunch so really as we get to sort of youknow 9 to 17 hours after waking there isa dip in autonomic arousal that duringthe middle of the day the postp perialdip there a post lunch sleepiness umthat can be partially offset by delayingyour morning caffeine a bit if you havethe afternoon crash but it's interestingthat you know that more productivemeetings and less um task switching anddistraction occurred um in meeting setafter lunch because that makes me thinkthat perhaps being a little bit lessalert is going to lend itself to morefocus and indeed that's the the sort ofoptimal State relaxed but focused youknow you're not sleepy um but you alsodon't have so much intrinsic energy thatyou're you know tending to a bunch ofthings because I think a lot of peopledo feel that way you know and I'mdrinking you know Double Espresso rightnow um late midm morning um late morninguh and you know I can sit still but Ithink certain Zoom meetings how do I saythis I don't want to offend any of mycolleagues I mean they are boring enoughthey are not content Rich enough to tograb all my attention and nowadays ofcourse there are multiple screenstypically I've got two phones in acomputer and you have to really spendsome work to flip over those phoneswhile I'm on a zoom and things like thatum so what were you saying so it's maybethe reduction in autonomic arousal thatthat supports what you just describedbut I don't know um my my thinking uh ormy understanding rather was that"

Universitylectures when I held courses in theevening I used to like to hold mycourses 5: to 7:00 p.m. or even 7 to9:30 p.m. when I was teachingundergraduates that people were muchlooser and more relaxed and I always umuh thought that that might havesomething to do with an increase in Gabatransmission that's known to happen latein the late evening that people are justkind of more relaxed more and lesssocial anxiety they've been aroundpeople for much of the day any I I Isend back more Reflections than answersI don't have any firm Neuroscienceexplanations for what you described butbut there are some emerging theoriesabout how it might work and it has this0o to 9 hours Phase One 9 to 17 hoursphase two and then of course from 17 to24hours I'll call it phase three youshould be asleep yeah ideally well thatI I think there's there's a there's aconfound in your your teachingexperience which is undergrads oftensleep in until what noon or they mightbe up until 4 a.m. or at least 10: a.m.seems to be a typical rise time for theundergrad so a morning class might betoo early for them to be fully awake butthere is um there's some brand newevidence that at least on creativity atwork um I read a series of I think itwas three studies recently showing thatearly birds actually did do morecreative work in the morning um and inpart uh I think again the I don't Idon't think any neuroscientist has hastouched the mechanisms on this yet butin terms of the psych ological processesum early on there's just there seems tobe a benefit of um of the energy levelum and some of that energy leads to moreDivergent thinking uh and later ifyou're a morning person you might losethe ability to to diverge quite as muchand so you end up in a more conventionalspace of thought does that does thattrack it all with your understanding ofhow it might play out in the brain myunderstanding is it would be a littlebit in it would be individual but youknow there is something to these LialStates between sleep and waking so maybewe can um r convenient bow around what Isaid and what you what you just saidwhich is um that we know that in thetransition States into an out of sleepand it doesn't necessarily have to bewithin the first half hour in and out ofsleep that um there seems to be moreDivergent think you or at leastactivation of neural networks that umare not as constrained as one observeswhen they're in a in a sheer task andstrategy implementation mode right Imean I think is that similar to theshower effect the shower effect sopeople have ideas in the shower or whilerunning or um while falling asleep or mybest ideas always come within the firsthour after waking that's why I carry anotebook around and much to the dismayof people in my life oftentimes I Idon't want to hear or from or talk toanyone first thing in the morning uhthis is problematic and I had to makeadjustments we'll talk about adjustmentsbetween um uh productivity and uh uhcontrol and and um Family interactionsthis is something I know you you'veworked on and and written about umbut those Lial states are areinteresting and and I'd love yourthoughts on this um I've had severalguests on this podcast talk about theircreative process um namely Rick Rubin umhe's famous for his work in musicproducing also has a great podcast tetrigrammaton um as well as Carl dice Roth acolleague of mine who's really in the0.00001% of um super talentedbioengineers neuroscientists who alsohappens to be a full-time um clinicalpsychiatrist and has five children okayum and I asked them about their creativeprocess because both of them are verycreative um Carl's process involves thefollowing late at night for him but itcould really be any time of daydeliberately making his body as still aspossible and forcing himself to think incomplete sentences Rick's creativeprocess although it includes a lot ofdifferent things has a lot to dowith also getting very still lying downokay other folks that I've spoken toacademics and and artists have referredto getting their body into motion butquieting their mind so these are twoopposite processes in one case the bodyis still but the mind is deliberatelyvery active in the other scenario thebody is very active but they're makingtheir mind sort of in free associationnot still but they're not deliberatelythinking about any one thing fascinatingand I'm obsessed with this maybe you andI could work on this you know I'm duefor a sabatical maybe we could figurethis out because I think I've never seenanyone study this before right becausethe the the nervous system no thenervous system I'm not aware of anyonehas done it formally either the nervoussystem of course is a is a brain bodyphenomenon and so what happens when wesort of cut off the deliberateoperations of brain or body and it itdoesn't seem to matter whether or notit's brain or body as long as one isdeliberately shut off and so anyway Ilove your thoughts on this um I don'tconsider myself like a Ultra creative orcreative type um to any great degree butme neither that's why but I'm fascinatedright but right but that's but I'mfascinated by these deliberate tacticsthat highly creative people have have uhundertaken um in order to bring aboutideas I certainly have some of my bestideas when I'm running and I'll just berunning along like my goodness I wasn'teven thinking now I need to write thisdown okay and then continue uh I triedthe diero approach and the the Rubenapproach actually just spent a week withRick um overseas and indeed he spends alot of time just still thinking and it'sa very hard practice to to get um to getconsistent with I wonder I wonder ifthere are individual differences here onon which needs to be stable or steady umI'm think you know I'm thinking about ahuge part of creativity is um isoverriding your default instincts and ifyou're somebody whose default is to haveyour mind constantly going then quietingwould probably shift your your train ofthought to something more original orunconventional um the opposite might betrue if you have a naturally quiet mineI would imagine you need to you need tosort of jolt yourself out of that withlots of access to you know to Freerranging thoughts and so um it'd beinteresting actually to study whether wecan predict what you should steal basedon your personality yeah I want andmaybe what we could do in that study Ithink we have a collaboration Brewingyou know there's a joke you know two twoscientists walk into a room and whatcomes out is a collaboration so um I'dwant to put people in a scanner it'shard to get people treadmilling in ascanner because the movement artifactbut and just look at net uh restingNetwork activation and compare that toresting Network activation when peopleare completely still and forcingthemselves to think in deliberatedeliberate sentences and then look atthe overlap in that vend diagram that'swhat's of interest to me they may becompletely different brain States theymight actually have more similarity thandifferences I wonder then if you can tiethat to differences in the quality andquantity of output so I would imaginethat one of the benefits of either kindof movement is that you um you end upincreasing the volume of ideas which weknow is good for variety and ultimatelyincreases the probability that youstumble onto something new but then Ithink this the being still part isprobably better for the filteringprocess of I think one of the hardestparts of creativity is actually judgingyour own ideas um most most creativepeople have many terrible ideas in factthe most creative people have the mosthorrible ideas U because they just havea lot of ideas and um I think that maybethere's a there's a way in whichquieting either your body or your mindallows you to gain some distance fromthe idea and see whether it's boneheadedorpromising I'd like to take a quick break"

ideas because umyou know Rick ruin talks a lot about youknow don't give the audience what theywant they don't know what they want theyhaven't seen it yet if it's a trulycreative idea they haven't seen it andum but of course we all have to developour own sense of taste so well how doesthis process work for you I mean you'vewritten about and worked on a tremendousrange of topics um and always you know Imust say say with with such rigor andsuch Clarity of communication aboutthose topics yeah it's absolutely true Imean like 100% so we say around here noweak sauce you know and a great phrasethere's no weak sauce in your game it'sincredible so um when do you get yourideas and how do you filter thoseideas I feel like the when could beanytime uh I think the I mean you'veyou've clearly experienced this too forme the best thing about hosting apodcast is I have an excuse to learnabout anything I want from almost anyoneI want and I get to call that part of myjob and so I feel like you know thathaving that built-in mechanism forlearning means ideas could could come atany moment uh the the filtering processfor me is um it's evolved over the lastfew years what I what I do now is if I'mlet's say I'm I'm starting a new bookI'll write a draft of the first chapterand I send it to five to eight peoplewhose judgment I trust and by Designsome of those people are in my fieldthey're you know deep-seated inorganizational psychology others are youknow very far outside but curious aboutthe topics I'm interested in and I askedthem for a zero to 10score uh this is something I learned todo as a as a springboard diver uh whereyou I would I would take off um and youknow I'm doing a few flips or twists andI think my dive is good but I can't seeit because I'm hurling in midair andit's a everything's a blur and so I haveto rely on my coach to tell me if it wasany good I feel like creative work isthe same way you're too close to it toknow how the audience is going to reactto it and yes you don't want to createit just for the audience but at the endof the day you want it to be you knowinteresting or useful to them so I askedfor the zero to 10 and no one ever says10 and then I use that as a calibrationmechanism so if everybody's in the sevenor eight range I know that I'm on tosomething promising and now I need torefine it if I get a bunch of twosthrees three and a halfs I either needto rethink the idea or dramaticallyrewrite how I'm positioning it and Ithink one of the mistakes a lot ofpeople make is they know they needfeedback on their ideas they go to oneor two people and they start to feel alittle bit defensive or threatened andtheir ego gets involved and then theydon't ask for any more what they don'trealize is it's actually less painful ifyou get more feedback because when eightdifferent people critique your work youstart to realize that a few of thecomments that sort of bruise you alittle bit were just IDI syncratic andno one else cared about those issues butthen five people had the same problemlike that is not taste that is a qualityissue and I've got to focus on that andso it really helps to filter what arethe what are the revisions I need tomake what are the problems andcomplaints I need to pay attention toversus what can I ignore because maybethis product was not for that person I'mrecalling when I was a postto I had amanuscript fully prepared and I workedin a laboratory where I didn't work onthe same thing as my postto advisor hewas very gracious and letting me be theoutlier um and he said well I don't knowanything about this topic so before yousubmit it to this fairly prestigiousvery frankly very prestigious JournalI'll be honest um you should probably godown the hall and hand it to so and so Idon't want to mention who it was becauseI'm still in the same Department um andI gave it to him this individual and helooked at and he said yeah you know itlooks interesting but I don't thinkthere's going to be a whole lot ofinterest in this it's just like not Iwas like no way like this I think thisis really cool but I was pretty dismayedso I was like oh go so what do I do so Iwent back to my adviser and thankfullyhe's a bit of an iconic CL and he saidthat's the best feedback you could havegotten definitely submit it to thatparticular journal and I must say thatpaper got accepted faster than any otherpaper I've never had an experience likethat I mean it required some revisions Iremember thinking like wow what anunusual response to after havinginstructed me to go ask a a a moresenior colleague right he was a at thattime assistant professor and then to getthe ne essentially negative response andthen to take that as like you shoulddefinitely send it out really taught mea lesson that sometimes one needs toinvert their um their action accordinguh to the negative feedback they get notalways but um that was an N of one okayso it's not uh shouldn't be extrapolatedto too many circumstances but umbasically led me to um not seek out uhfeedback prior to submission of thingsterribly often I mean uh I checkinformation obviously prior to podcast Icheck the validity of the information inpodcasts and papers but um it made merealize that people's opinions can belike highly idiosyncratic and and insome cases outright wrong and really thethe opinion of the journal is what Whatmattered most in in terms of getting itaccepted or not so um how do you yousaid give it to the greatest number ofpeople but if it's anything likecomments on social media there's asalience to negative comments ments sohow should we filter positive versusnegative feedback well there's a there'sa met analysis here this is kuger andDenise um looking at 100 Years offeedback research and they found thatwhat drives the utility of feedback isnot whether it's positive or negativeit's whether it focuses on the task oron the self so if I tell you that yourwork is terrible you're going to getdefensive if I tell you that your workis great you're going to get complacentif I tell you here's the specific thingthat I liked about your work you'regoing to try to learn to repeat that andif I tell you here's the thing I didn'tlike you're going to try to see if youcan fix it so I actually think we shouldworry less about whether the feedback isencouraging or discouraging and moreabout how do I make sure that I getinput that's going to allow me to learnfrom my strengths and also overcome myweaknesses um and actually I uh one ofthe things I've I've learned recently isthere's some I would say a growing bodyof evidence at this point that askingfor feedback is not the best way to getpeople to help you um because when youask for feedback you end up getting twogroups of people you get cheerleadersand you get critics and cheerleaders arebasically applauding your best selfcritics are attacking your worst selfwhat you want is a coach which issomebody who helps you become a betterversion of yourself and the way you getpeople to coach you is not to say giveme feedback because they will then lookat the past and tell you what youscrewed up or what you did right whatyou want is to say can you give meadvice for next time and then they lookat the future and they'll give youeither a note on something to repeat orsomething to correct and this is such asubtle shift that it can make a bigdifference um Andrew one of the thingsI've I guess I found myself applyingthis to a lot is um uh after givingspeeches I used to get off stage and sayi' would love some feedback and you getback a bunch of oh you know I reallyenjoyed that thanks what do I do withthat information I'm trying to learn howto get better and when I shift thequestion to say what's the one thing Icould do better next time it's like ohdon't open with a joke the audiencecouldn't tell you were joking um uhfrequently it's give me a little bitmore of a through line uh you focused alot on you know a bunch of interestingpoints but I lost the connective tissueand you know those those actionablesuggestions are much more likely to comewhen you just ask for a tip as opposedto an evaluation oh that's so good I'm Gto just pause for a second I I've nevertaken a pause I've taken occasionalpause to be honest but they're very rareum as the audience knows oh that that'sjust gazillion dollar advice because Ithink that um everyone has an ego we allwant to perform Well we'd like toperform better over time and negativefeedback hurts and it can hurt a littleor a lot depending on how defensive weare but a tool like you just describedto uh remove some of thatdefensive armor that we all have and andactually let the information in in a waythat's constructive uh is really greatwhat you described I think is a way tocreate constructive criticism but theconstructive part is really coming fromwithin yeah as opposed to saying I'dlike some constructive criticism andthen hoping that the criticism isactually constructive so you're takingcontrol over the process in a healthyway in a benevolent way that that's thegoal and I think the the big question"

probably myfavorite technique on this I learnedfrom Sheila Keen she calls it the thesecond score and the idea is that whensomebody gives you a piece of criticismuh that's your first score so let's sayyou know they like I in my in my worldthey gave me a three and a half and Iwant to know how I can do better nexttime how do I get myself to focus onthat what I do is say I want to get a 10for how well I took the three and a halfand that's the second score I want toevaluate myself on how well I took thefirst score I I think about this almostevery day there was um actually can Itell you a quick story so when I was uhright out of my doctorate I got asked toteach a a motivation class for Air Forcegenerals and Colonels I was25 I think 25 26 um you know they'rethey're all twice my age uh they've gotthousands of flying hours they've gotbillion dollar budgets uh they've gotwell you know this community well theirnicknames Striker and sandun and I wasextremely intimidated so I I walked inthere and I I thought I had to impressthem and I started talking about mycredentials and you know all my researchexperience and the feedback at the endof the 4our session was brutal Iremember uh reading the feedback forumsand one person had written moreknowledge in the audience than on thepodium I was like true I can't arguewith that and then another wrote Igained nothing from this session but Itrust the instructor gain usefulinsight and that that was devastating Iwas like can I like I would really liketo transform into an actual bear andhibernate for the next four months andthen maybe I'll come out of a hole readyto hear this I didn't have that option Ihad committed to teach a second sessiona week later so all I could do wasfigure out how am I going to hear thisfeedback and really take it seriouslyand I guess I applied a version of thesecond score and I said all right thereyou know there's some general that aregoing to come back and see me again andI've got to prove to them that I wasopen to feedback and one of the things Iheard loud and clear was that uh theyvalued humility and I had led with toomuch confidence which was justinsecurity masted and so I thought okayhow do I how do I change the equationand walked in looked at the room and Isaid I know what you're all thinkingright now what could I possibly learnfrom a professor who's 12 yearsold deadsilence like oh no this is this is goingto go horribly wrong and then uh one ofthe guys in the audience jumps in he'slike oh that's ridiculous you got to beat least13 everybody started laughing it brokethe ice and I think what what I wastrying to do was to take myself off thepedestal and say look I heard yourfeedback uh you told me that you didn'tthink I had anything to teach you andI've got to acknowledge that right upfront and be open to the fact thatthat's true and so I want to come inhere and learn from you and I want tosee if I can Curry to conversation wherewe all end up learning and the feedbackwas night and day different afterward II one one person wrote although Juniorinexperience the professor dealt withthe evidence in an interesting way Ilike all right I'll take it and umthere's something really powerful aboutabout saying look you know I I can'tchange the fact that they hated mysession what I can do is convince themthat I was motivated to learn from theircriticism I love this concept of thesecond score and thank you for sharingthat story I think um you know very veryoften um we hear about people like youwho if people didn't catch the math inthere uh you were a PhD by age 25 um andas far as I know the the youngest tenerprofessor at pen at 28 so these areoutrageous uh outrageously impressive ummetrics of accomplishment but for you toshare a um a story about uh you know umless than Optimal Performance and howyou adjusted to it and and and theincorporation of the the second score umthat you're referring to I think is uhis really appreciated because I thinkthat um as much as we hear you know ohyou know Jordan you know took many moreyou know free throws and everyone justthinks about all the ones he made youknow people think about all the ones hemade that's the way the game worksthat's the way the mind works I shouldsay so it's um I appreciate that youflesh it out with a with a personalexample I too would want to turn into abarar and disappear but I would but Ithink that um it's really impressivewhat you did and and I and it makes methink that the second score of getting a10 at at bringing the three and a halfupright uh as it were um is really aboutturning ascore into a verb process you know overand over again as I've do this podcastand as I've taught in the classroom whatI keep coming back to is this idea thatwe should be focusing more on verbs andless on nouns we love to name things andcategorize them but but when we startliving life through a lot of verbprocesses so instead of getting BeingFit uh we think about that you know orrunning as a thing we really think aboutlike just running right it becomes lessdaunting and and we accomplish far morebut the idea that um you know and thishas this there mathematical models ofthis I'm sure but where you're basicallytalking about you know like an integralright as opposed to just some valueright you're talking about the slope ofthe line yeah right so you're a threeand a half how are you going to get to a10 gosh that's a huge gap and you'redealing with being back on your heelspsychologically from getting all thisyou know battering feedback from theseuh you know these uh highly accomplishedindividuals all these inment and youknow literally wearing them presumablyon their body body uh so for you to seeand and it's really about creating it'sabout taking control of the slope ofthat line from the three onward and it'sreally a forward-looking perspective soI don't think we're being unduly uhpsychological here or analytic I mean Ithink it's really about taking a amoment State and a noun and turning itinto a verb yeah I think that's right II'm reminded of the great philosopherHomer Simpson who said that verbingweirds language uh so it's harder totalk about this stuff in verbs I swear Ididn't steal it from The Simpsons but ifit came from Homer Simpson like I'm allfor it you have to I mean that's smallbrain small brain but you know given thesize of his brain and people have seenthe image uh uh you know fairly fairlyrobust knowledge no I I I think you'reon to something I think um verbs areactive and we're we're drawn to them umI think yeah a lot of times peoplereview their past to work and they justlike they end up shaming an earlierversion of themselves and they theywallow in rumination and what what wewant to try to do in that situationwhich is e easier said than done is isto say all right like the purpose of youknow of of getting feedback or advice isnot to shame my past self it's toeducate My Future Self um which I thinkis very connected to a lot of the workon growth mindset that that you've beentalking about and uh there's been afirestorm of controversy around uh canwe teach growth mindset in schoolslately and uh I think what what that isunderscored for me is look you can't youcan't expect someone to listen to Onepodcast episode or go through oneworkshop and magically believe thatthey're capable of learning anything atany moment um this is something we haveto actively work on on a daily basis andpart of doing that exactly as you saidis thinking about the slope and sayingall right um the person that I'm youknow I'm competing with is my past selfand I want to get a little bit bettertoday than I wasyesterday yeah I think um along thelines of growth mindset obviously we"

mindset myunderstanding and um I'd love to knowyour thoughts on this is that when the Dwork is combined with some of the AliCrum work that is growth mindset iscombined with a knowledge just a basicand true understanding that stress andthe feelings of anxiety and tension thatum can actually be performance-enhancingwhen those two things are combined Ithink this is the work of David joergerand colleagues at UT Austin that uhindeed growth mind becomes um morevisible in our in our uh mindsets andperformance um and are there otheraspects to growth mindset and and otherum other mindsets that are now beingwoven into that framework that that canbe helpful because I know um gosh ifever there was a great name for a aoppsychology growth mindset it tells youeverything you want everything you needand everything you sort of need to knowand just the name um but uh we all findit difficult to implement um just justtelling myself I'm not as good assomething as I could be yet it soundsgreat but in moments of you knowreceiving feedback uh that's harsh umsometimes it's hard to access yeah it isI think so the the latest there's amamera um at all met analysis and thenyou know I think sort of that campversus the the Carol and David Camp umyou know have very different views onhow big the effects are but I think onething they they seem to agree on isgrowth mindset is more important incircum ances uh where people are morelikely to need it um so if you thinkabout for example um kids who areimpoverished um or marginalizedcommunities um you know the message thatyou actually you know that you you arecapable of um you know of evolving yourskills to the point that somethingyou're bad at today you could be good atnext year um is really important whenyou've never heard that before um andwhen you don't have a single personbelieving in you I think where um wherewe're often missing the boat is we thinkall right I'm just going to I'm going toinstill this idea in a person's head andmy work is done um and we know that thecontext around you really matters so umactually Carol's done some researchshowing that uh growth mindset is morelikely to have an impact uh when yourclassroom culture um also and yourteacher right has the belief that kidsare capable of learning and growing umthat your you know your starting abilityis not fixed in any subject and I thinkwe probably for all of us as individualswhat that means is we need to thinkabout the the micro environment that weput ourselves in um I think you know theGU one one of the things I've thinking alot about lately is scaffolding and theidea that you know when you're whenyou're trying to improve at somethingyou don't need a a permanent teachernecessarily you don't need one Mentoryou know guiding you for nine years whatyou need is is somebody who can give youthe temporary support that allows you toto scale to a New Height just like ascaffold wood on a building um and inlearning theory basically the ideabehind scaffolding is we're we're goingto initially give you the support youneed to solve a problem and then we'regoing to slowly remove the support sothat you learn to to do it on your ownand I think that those those kinds ofscaffolds are often missing so weinstill the growth mindset like I've gotthis belief in my head but I don't knowwhat I need to do um to you know to putthat belief into action and that's whereum that I guess that that to me is wehave to go beyond mindset we have tothink about how do we put people in acontext that allows them to to put theirbeliefs intopractice you are asking me what else dowe need like to support growth mindsetand make it effective right yeah I meanwe know people learn what growth mindsetis it's the idea that you're not as goodat something yet okay terrific but it'svery hard to implement in real timethere are I have to presume additionaltools that one can uh bolster the growthmindset with make it make it moreaccessible um and benefit from it yes soum Justin Berg and Amy res nesin I uhstudied this actually uh we did um wewere looking at growth mindset at workand uh Justin's uh well he's at StanfordI don't know if you met him yet I havenot but big place um he'll be on thelist soon if a brilliant creativityresearcher and Amy just joined us at atWharton and uh has fundamentally changedthe way that I think about um ideas umin the way that she studied how we canshape our context and just donepathbreaking work there and we we wereinterested in growth mindset and we wedesigned an intervention where peoplecould learn growth mindset at work um sowe taught them to think about how theirskills were malleable how they couldstretch their knowledge into new areasand we found that teaching them that wasnot enough to boost their happiness ortheir performance what we needed to alsodo was um give them a growth mindset notjust about themselves but also abouttheirjobs uh in other words to teach themthat your job is a set of flexiblebuilding blocks that you've got a wholebunch of tasks that make up your jobsome of those are you know are things todo others are might be interactions thatyou need to have and if you break downyour your job into all these tests youmight have some tests that you want toaccentuate and make a bigger part ofyour job others that you want to try tosubtract um others that you might swapwith a colleague and a lot of people itturns out think their jobs are are fixedby their job descriptions but in factyou have a ton of opportunity to saywait a minute you know there's somethingthere's a strength I have but I'm notusing it right now is there a way we canbring that into my work and so um inthese couple experiments we did when werandomly assigned people to learn boththat their jobs were malleable and thattheir skills were malleable um they gota sustainable boost to their happinessthat lasted at least 6 months there wasno cost to their performance u meaningyou could to redesign your own job to bemore enjoyable without uh without a dropin the effectiveness of yourcontributions uh to your workplace and Ithink what I I came away from thatresearch realizing is like it's notenough to just say well well I can getbetter I can improve because very oftenyou feel like your your environment islimited I'm like great like yeah I cangrow but I'm stuck in a deadend job andso what we need to do there is um isopen up the opportunity for people to umto to innovate on their own jobdescription and then growth mindset canbegin to to have an impact I love it itsounds a bit like adding a s to growthgrowth mindset so it's not growthmindset it's growth mindsets uh becauseearlier you mentioned that in theclassroom environment if the teacheradopts a growth mindset yes as well asthe students well then you have aculture of growth mindset so it's the uminterconnectedness of of this and theand the context in which theindividual's growth mindset exists do Ihave that right well put yeah we weended up calling it dual mindset um butI think making it a plural is goodbecause um you know it's it's not I Ihave this image of um you know you youput a person in a in a cage and thentell them they're capable of growingthey're still stuck in a cage and so weneed to we need to give them a chance toto bust through those walls superimportant I hate to take us back to anearlier topic U but there's something"

to callit a few years backum the relationship between intrinsicmotivation and performance on othertasks um yeah and the reason I askedthis is severalfoldum I did two episodes of the podcast onADHD and one of the things that Ilearned in talking to experts on ADHDpeople with ADHD as well as looking atsome of the novel treatments everythingfrom behavioral to prescription drug toeven nutrition-based was that kids andadults with clinically diagnosed ADHDare actually terrific at payingattention to things that they reallyenjoy or that they're super interestedin so clearly they have the capacityit's just that they have umdeficits if you will in attending tothings that are less exciting to themless intriguing to them so if I recallcorrectly uh you have a publication thatexplored the relationship betweenintrinsic motivation and performance inother stuff yeah and one of the majorconclusions was that having a deep deepinterest in one thing might not be thebest uh condition for performing well atother less interesting tasks Could youum could you tell us about that studywhat what motivated you to carry outthat study and what some of the majortakeaways were yeah definitely um youyou summarize it really well I think umthe the original impetus so this wasanother project with G shin and uh Gcame to me want wanting to studyintrinsic motivation and we were talkingabout what do we know about intrinsicmotivation and what are the gaps in ourknowledge and one thing that has alwaysbothered me is when psychologists studysomething that sounds positive and theyonly study the benefits of it likethere's no no such thing as anunmitigated good right all all all sortof enjoyable experiences have costs allunpleasant experiences can have benefitswe need to we need to fill out this twoby two of good thing bad thing um goodoutcome bad outcome um and so mychallenge to her was can you show me theDark Side of intrinsic motivation andshe came back and she said what ifthere's a cost of loving a task leadingyou to hate a task that you don't likeeven more than you did before I like ohthat's an interesting idea it trackswith the basic psychology of contrasteffects uh where um you know if you eatsomething delicious then your leastfavorite food tastes a little bit worseafterward and so I said let's let'sstudy this so um she ended up gettingdata from um from people at work andthen we also designed an experiment andsure enough uh the the more passionateyou are on task one the more yourperformance suffers if task two isreally boring and I guess what what thisdid for me is it made me thinkdifferently about task sequencing I usedto wake up in the morning and do my mostinteresting task first and then thegrading was hell and what I do now is Istart with a moderately interesting taskit's a little bit of a warm-up for meand then I have an exciting one to lookforward to and if I do have a taskthat's boring but important I think theperformance is going to sufferless interesting um I normally don't askabout morning routines and how onestructures a day because it's highlyindividual completely agree yeah and andit depends on whether or not people havekids and they're pets and you know otheruh but I'll just share with you a briefanecdote I have a friend who's a veryaccomplished musician and has been forfor several decades now and he told methat he has a practice of after he getsoff stage and he's like Stadium Stadiumsellout level ummusician um has been for a long time andshows no signs of stopping justincredible but a very down toe person umand he said one of the first things doeswhen he gets off stage is to go do somemenial task I thought there's no waythat's true but I've known his wifesince college and she she verified thatstatement I was like what what sorts ofmedial task you talking about he's likeoh like cleaning up some of the cans andthings that are there maybe evencleaning a toilet at a venue and Ithought no chance but it turns out to betrue and I said what what's this aboutis this about humility he said wellmaybe a little bit but he said itactually makes it a lot easier for himto return home and deal with the kind oflittle things that just are out of scalewith the experiences that he just hadhe's tapering way okay I think yeah yeahI I first of all I was so struck by thefact that he had um created this processfor himself so long ago and he's alsosomebody who's you know he's maintainedhe's like been the same marriage for anextremely long time he's he's extremelyhappy in that and his family I mean seeone of these people that seems to thrivein all domains of life and I'm certainthat he struggles in some domain of lifebecause everybody does but um it soundto me like a very unusual practice butit seems to kind of relate to this thatyou know he has this thing that he lovesdoing playing music and performing inparticular and he's just you know youknow.01% at doing that um then just likebring himself back down to Earth becauseso much of life and especially familylife is like dealing with the theSchmutz and the inconvenience ofeveryday life yeah he's it's it actuallysounds like what he's doing is he'sresetting his frame of reference to sayif you know if I go right home then thecontrast between you this high octaneexperience I'm having um and sort ofmuddling through everyday life um isgoing to be extreme if I do somethingreally small then um family time isgoing to seem a lot bigger yeah so Irealize I'm I'm taking a bit of a leapfrom your study on intrinsic motivationand and low performance in in otherdomains but you know to me cleaning upcleaning a toilet is you know I it'sit's uh it's boring for all the wrongreasons right um as you said you do notwant that to be an exciting no and andlisten I mean if I had to do it for aliving I would you right and I would tryand do as well as possible and uh uh butum right so well I found that study tobe particularly interesting because Ithink that these days we um we glorifyhigh performance even quotquot PeakPerformance um something we can talkabout and we forget that um yes oftentimes people who are ultra highperformers can afford to pay otherpeople to do all the other stuff but Ihave to say in knowing some ultra highperformers and in knowing some people inthe um billionaire bracket you knowthere's a high incidence of of mentalhealth issues frankly and um lack ofsatisfaction with life that maybe evencomes from not um having to do anythingbesides the things that you find mostintrinsically rewarding um we all thinkthat oh I if I could I spend all daydoing the things that I find mostintrinsically rewarding but maybethere's something about this Push Pullwe know the brain works in push pullwith almost everything that having someexperiences each day that are kind oflike H this a thing again do you thinkthat heightens our level of satisfactionfor the things we really enjoy I wouldbe surprised if it didn't uh I think Ithink contrast effects are very powerfuland we know I mean the there's half acentury of research on happinesssuggesting that the comparisons we makeare what matter um you know I think Ithink Tim Urban probably put it bestwhen he said happiness is reality minusexpectations and if you only haveenjoyable experiences your expectationsarerising into perpetuity uh so it doesn'tmatter how good your reality is youwanted it to be better and better um Ithink one of the things that mundaneexperiences um managed to do for us uhor maybe a better way to say it is Ithink one of the benefit fit of mhenexperiences is they keep ourexpectations on the ground uh and allowus to be pleasantly surprised by youknow a task that was more interestingthan we expected even though we didn'tlove it what are your thoughts on umwhat I call

you're you're alludingto this um I I read some research thatjust came out this year showing that umone of the benefits one of thesurprising benefits of morning workoutsis you actually have more confidence inyour job uh because you get that smallwin like I accomplished something thismorning and that gives you a sense ofefficacy that you can carry over intoyour you know the start of your work dayuh not to suggest that everyone shouldwork out in the morning because I'm I'mwith you I think everybody should youknow both work and work out at a timethat works for them but I think um Ithink there's something to be said foruh something went really well in onerealm of my life and that boosts mybelief in my capability to tacklechallenges in a different realm whatabout in the opposite direction uh youwere a competitive diver um I have topresume that there were days when youhad lousy Dives it must have been thatthat one day Adam felt like every dayand then you you leave you know you youyou shower up dry off head head into therest of your day and you know how do wesegment away from the you know negativethought spirals of like something wentreally poorly and now you're off intothe domain of life where you can do youknow how to do the things that you'rerequired to do but maybe there's someChallenge and some learning involved howdo we cut Moes between negativeexperiences I think uh I mean the Tedlasso strategy is ideal become agoldfish 10-second memory and then youdon't even you don't even recall thepractice you had earlier today I thinkthat I don't know anybody who can dothatconsistently um and I think the moredisappointing the experience is the moreyou tend to to dwell on it Ithink uh when when you talk aboutsegmenting negativeexperiences I think the probably theresearch that I've liked best on thisand I just want to I want to make sure Icapture thisclearly um I basically so research onemotion regulation says there there aretwo strategies that tend to be effectiveone is distraction the other isreframinguh so distraction is you know findsomething else that will consume yourattention um that's unrelated to thething that you just bombed at uh and thehope is that you know that that Fadesinto the background reframing is a lotof what you were talking about a fewminutes ago which is okay let me Focusyou know not on the level of myperformance but the slope um my divingcoach Eric best uh has a really greatset of questions that he he asks and youknow I I I remember I would i' finishpractice like this is a terrible day Ijust feel like I'm worthless as a diverand now diving was a big part of myidentity I'm going to let my team downnow I'm a bad teammate too my coach iswasting his time and like now you knowhe could have been you know trainingsomebody much better like why am I doingthis and Eric would ask uh did you makeyourself bettertoday and even if it was a bad practicethere is something that improved yesokay and sometimes the answer feels likeno and then he would ask did you makesomeone else better today like yeah Igave a little tip to a teammate um youknowI I made a joke that you know that madeeverybody laugh and he was like greatthen it wasn't a bad day and I I thinkthis is this is an example of what goodreframing looks like um to say okay thegoal wasn't to be great it was to bebetter the goal wasn't necessarily justto make myself better it was also tomake other people better um and I thinkthose are the kinds of questions thatseem to segment pretty wellI love that feedback because I think weall get stuck in those thought Spiralsand um again not to demonize smartphonesbecause they are wonderful tools but Ihave to remember the time I'm 48 yearsold uh as of tomorrow and I have toremember a time in which um negativestuff was probably happening in thebackground but I didn't hear about itbecause no one was texting it to me soI'd find out at the end of the day whenI still had time to do other things inthe meantime right um that said I wouldalso get Negative experiences early inthe day and then carry them throughoutthe entire day when nowadays you can geta positive text message that says okayit wasn't so bad um or

examplesthat um from the research where umpeople overcoming their blind spots hasbenefited them that would be amazingyeah wow there's a lot there let me welllet me start by saying Ithink a lot of people think about blindspots in terms of heris sixs and biasesso you think about confirmation bias youthink about the the classic Conan tersiwork uh that ended up winning Dan aNobel Prize on um you know the the wayin which um you know our intuitivejudgments um often get anchored in theway we've done things before um or youknow we focus on the information that'sSan and available to us and Overlook youknow less obvious information I've cometo think that the the mother of allbiases is uh what I what I think of asthat I'm not biasedbias um it's it's technically called thebias blind spot in Emily pron and andcolleagues research but the idea is thatI think I'm more objective than otherpeople and you may have your you mayhave flaws in your thinking Andrew butme like I I see things clearly andrationally and I think that this is ait's a really dangerous metabias becausethe moment you believe you're not biasedyou are incapable of seeing any of yourbiases um so in some of the research onthe bias blind spot you see that um thatpeople who have um who score high incognitive ability tests so you know highIQ are actually more likely to fallvictim to the I'm not biased biasbecause they've been reinforced for alifetime uh that they're really smartand they're good at thinking oh goodnessthis explains some uh we don't talkabout current events on this podcastmuch but this explains some currentevents uh people that were told theirentire careers that they are perfect ornear perfect and um uh yeahcircumstances eventually came to youknow slam them hard into the concrete onthat one or or in some cases it hasn'thappened yet but we we watch themhurdling toward Earth um so I I worry alot about that so I think the beginningof you know of seeing any blind spot isrecognizing that we all have blind spotsit's part of Being Human um I think thatthe brighter side of that is that we'renot just blind to weaknesses we're alsoblind to our strengths um so Jane Duttonand Laura Morgan Roberts and colleaguesuh did some research on the reflectedbest self-portrait this is one of myfavorite exercises to do in theclassroom but also to do in workplacessometimes even people end up doing itwith their kids at home the idea is thatyou know you do have strengths thatyou're not that aware of uh they may bethings that come naturally to you thatyou don't even realize are hard forother people they may be things that arestruggles for you um and so you youthink it's hard to do and therefore I'mbad at it but other people watch you doit and realize you're actually quitegood at it so the you need other peopleto hold up a mirror to see what theseinvisible strengths are so the way thereflective best self Exercise Works isyou're asked to contact 10 to 20 peoplewho know you well in different walks oflife might be a family member a couplefriends some colleagues and then you askthem to tell a story about a time whenyou were at your best and you collectthese stories it's it's the mostexciting week of email you will ever get20 notes let me tell you how great youare but what's key this goes back to ourdiscussion of feedback earlier isthey're really specific about a momentwhen you are at your best and then yourjob is to collect all the stories and dothe pattern recognition exercise and askwhat are the common themes that I'veseen through these stories and it's ait's a really powerful and Vivid way ofof getting a sense of what are thosestrengths and um you know it's notsurprising that in some of the researchwhen people go through this process umthey end up with much more clarity notonly about what they're what they'regood at and where their potential liesbut also how do I like what do thosesituations have in common where I wasable to use my strengths and how do Iget myself in those situations moreoften how do I create those situationsmore often um I I'll give you a personalexample on this so I I got a bunch offeedback that uh I was good at helpingother people see theirstrengths and I thought okay I don'tfeel like I have enough opportunities touse that strength in my daily life sowhat am I going to do about this and Iended up flipping the exercise upsidedown and I picked a 100 people who umreally mattered to me and I wrote astory to each of them about a time whenthey were at their bestand I'm like there's there's no reason Ican't I can't make this part of my dayum it's probably it was it was probablyone of the best weeks of My Life um itwas better than getting the stories waswas giving them uh and I got these notesback from people saying you know I Ididn't realize I don't even rememberthat thing thathappened um but I think for me it was anexample of saying okay um you know I'veI've always enjoyed um trying to bringout the best in others uh I don't feelfeel like at the time I was a I was afirst year doctoral student I didn'tfeel like I had anything to contributeto others I'm try I'm trying to learnhow to you know understand this fieldand you know do a worthwhile study andwrite a paper I'm not teaching yet Ihave no value to add and getting thisfeedback like oh you're somebody whohelps other people see their potentialI'm like all right let me let me takesome people that I you know I alreadyrecognize um really amazing things inand let me just tell them that uh and ittook me about a week to write the the100 emails and um I can't think of a aweek I've spent better wow it's sointeresting that you flipped the processon its head a bit um or a lot and thatended up being the reward do you thinkyou learned anything about given that itwas early in your academic career do you"

maybewe could um seed this with uh a findingthat you've also written about which isthat you know people who have and exerta lot of proficiency and even control intheir profession life will sometimesbring that to their relationship lifeand that doesn't work right the ideathat like being in charge and beingconfident is a great is a great set ofattributes um but it can really fail usin other domains uh can we weave that inwith blind spots yeah we can so I thinkthat so one of the things I I found overthe past few years is that and this wasinspired by a a Phil tetlock frameworkum a lot of us spend a lot of our timethinking like preachers prosecutors orpoliticians preachers prosecutorspoliticians yeah so you can think aboutthese as as three mental modes that evenif you've never worked in any of thesecareers you you will watch your thinkingcolored by at least one of them moreoften than you would like so in preachermode you're basically proz your ownviews uh and you I mean Andrew you'rea in some in some situations I think ofyou as a highly effective professionaldebunker of preachers of you knowcertain kinds of snake oil when it comesto health um and you know and biology umsometimes you take that too far andpeople might accuse you of being aprosecutor uh where you're attackingother people's views um and then um thethird mode politician mode is isbasically you don't even bother tolisten to people unless they alreadyagree with your views what I what Ithink is is interesting is these thesemodes of thinking are adaptive for in incertain roles um so preachers make greatsales people they're often Visionaryleaders uh prosecutors are often highlyeffective scientists right we Excelcriticizing other people's work andfinding what's wrong with it umpoliticians are great at currying favorum they do a lot of lobbying they winapproval the problem is that all ofthese modes stop you from questioningyour own assumptions and beliefs um somy I I'll tell you my biggest device isprosecutor mode uh I've been called alogic bully my wife had to explain to methat was not acompliment oh mygoodness if I I mean I know I knowyou've experienced this too if I if I ifI feel confident that there's strongevidence that somebody is wrong Ibelieve it's my moral responsibility tocorrect them and that never goes wellamazing um I won't reflect on my ownexperience I'll just say yes and yes uhright right the the um logic word ninjamode um is one that I think we'retrained in as academics we are and thatand you know if you're a lawyer or youknow or uh many other professions aswell um and I think it holds value andit can be very effective in certaindomains but um less effective in otherdomains yes and I think part of theproblem is you know when I actuallywhether you're preaching Prosecuting orpoliticking excuse me or politicking youlook like you're not open uh becauseyou've already in all cases you thinkyou're right and other people are wrongand so that makes it really hard forother people to to reason with you todisagree thoughtfully with you so myfavorite alternative and and this is atthe heart of what you do for a living umand for fun is thinking like ascientist and when I say thinking like ascientist I do not mean that you need tobuy a microscope or invest in atelescope what I mean is as as you modelso effectively a good scientist has thehumility to know what they don't knowand the Curiosity to constantly seek outnew knowledge there have been multipleexperiments showing that when people aretaught to think like scientists uh theirjudgment improves and so did theirdecisions and I think a lot of thatstems from um when when you go intoscientist mode you realize that all ofyour opinions are just hypotheseswaiting to be tested all of yourdecisions are experiments and so you'relike well I you know I'm not trying toprove that I'm right I'm trying to findout if I might be wrong and then if Ifind out I am wrong it's easier to Pivotand instead of being really invested inbeing right I can try to get it right umand I think in some ways that's thethat's the meta message that I'm tryingto communicate to people with my work isum assumptions are meant to be pressuretested they're meant to be questionedand challenged and if you're not openinto rethinking your views um then youbasically turn thinking into a religionuh and I don't know about you but Iprefer to base my views on on good dataum as opposed to Blind Faith um and Ithink that's been a huge part of yourcontribution in the last three or soyears to public discourse is um you'veyou've helped people think morescientifically and talk morescientifically about their daily habitsand behaviors and um I guess my my bigquestion is how do we help people dothat more often even in domains wherethey don't access to scientificknowledge and they don't read journalsfirst of all thanks for the kind wordsof feedback I think you know my my goalis always to you know identify who'scoming to the podcast for health toolsand protocols and hopefully teach themsome science and scientific thinking andfor those that are coming to the podcastfor Science and scientific thinkinghopefully they get some health tools andprotocols also but um because I fell inlove with science for the exact reasonthat you're describing which is that Iuh I lived I grew up in a family thatwas very divided politically alongreligious lines along essentially everyline of like what foods to eat what washealthy what wasn't and the only way Icould reconcile um these very franklypolarized views was to you know embarkon the scientific method pose ahypothesis and then try and disproveone's hypothesis and some things getthrough the filter and it's a constantlearning so um I should just ask whenyou teach people how to be a scientist"

that isthat sort of the Crux of of what uh inthese experiments is um you'redescribing as teaching people how to bescientists like if they just do thatthen they'll they're going to benefit Ithink that's that's at the very heart ofthe lens is I want to just double clickon the idea of disproving yourhypothesis right most people live in aLand of confirmation bias where they'rethey're basically just looking forsupport for their pre-existing beliefsthat's right they're click foraging weall do this by the way I'm notcriticizing here we all will have anidea and then we will click forageonline to support the ideathat we disagree with them they disagreewith us ah here's somebody I agree withand that agrees with me I think and doyou think this has roots in our um youknow in the neural Circuit underpinningsof of um just wanting to haveaffiliation that affiliation feels goodyeah having people that are like usknowing that we're kind of protected inthat yeah I think that's a big part ofit I think one of the reasons that we weencase ourselves in Echo Chambers and umhide in filter bubbles is uh there'sthere's a strong evolutionary pressureto avoid social exclusion and so youknow it's not it's not just the you knowbeing drawn to affiliation it's also umI I really want I'm afraid of beingexcommunicated from my group and if Ichallenge the Orthodoxy of the communitythat I belong to I might be an outcastum and I don't think I don't think everyday people think through that logic butI think there's a there's a deep-seatedum visceral tendency to avoid that andyou know I think the when we think aboutteaching people to see their blind spotsmore clearly um a lot of that is isrecognizing it's hard to do that on yourown um because by definition you'reblind spots are invisible to you and sothis is why other people's input is soimportant and I think you know I'm Iknow this makes a lot of peopleuncomfortable but I think everybody onsocial media should follow people thatthey disagree with but not just for thesake of it you want people who reachdifferent conclusions from you but whereyou respect the Integrity of theirthought process those are the people whoreally stretch your thinking and I thinkthat's what we were train to do um it'swhat I was trained to do as a socialscience a social scientist is to listento the ideas that made me think hard notjust the ones that made me feel good andto surround myself with people whochallenged my thought process not justthe ones who validated my conclusionsand I think you know a lot of peoplehear that message and they're like nobut I don't want to let that like thatawful perspective into my world I'm likeno you want to be more nuanced in sayingwho are the people where before I knewwhat their answer was I would beimpressed with the depth and thethoroughness of their reflection andtheir analysis I should be followingthose people and learning from themregardless of the the hypotheses thatthey generate and the results that theyshare I'm so glad that you mentioned theum importance of following people thatyou disagree with I think one thing thatwe have to highlight and I'm hoping willmaybe even emerge from this conversationis that follows are not endorsements andand this is actually a real problem Imean there are academics who have losttheir jobs not necessarily for followingcertain accounts but for um commentingon certain common threads maybe even alike is a is a slightly differentcategory because it's as the namesuggests it's a like it's a it soundslike and it's thought of as a vote ofapproval of what's there yeah but whenone's options are just um you know aheart uh a follow or no heart no followum you know I was a big fan of thethumbs up thumbs down I kind of like thethumbs up thumbs down because at leastyou have that you have an option to toum to descent um without getting intoonline uh comment battles and things ofthat sort but um listen i' I've had umuh people ask me why do you follow soand so because follows are also seen asa sign of support because you're addingadding followers and presumably uh inthe algorithm raising prominence to achannel but I'm right there with you Ifollow lots of accounts um of people whoI fundamentally disagree with but I'mtrying to learn and I'm also trying tounderstand what what their capturepoints are like like why people findthem so intriguing yes um anyway I'm I'ma learner I'm a forager like you so II'm in the same boat and every once in awhile I think like it it's stunning tome I don't know if you've ever looked atyour like your Instagram statistics umbut some somebody um a colleague of mineactually showed me I was like I didn't Ididn't realize you could look at theeffect of each post on follows andunfollows oh I didn't realize that andyou know the I think my typical ratiomight be two or three to one for a postso you know I'm gaining two or three totwo or three followers to every one thatI lose the idea that I could postanything that would cause someone tounfollow me like if I said somethinginteresting enough that you thought Iwas worth following how could how couldone post change your mind about that Ithink you're too focused on what I thinkand maybe not paying attention to how Ithink um was my my first reaction tothat and then my second my secondthought was well maybe maybe What'sHappening Here is like people show upand they don't realize the foundation ofevidence behind the total body of workand so one post you know strikes themwrong and they think this person is notcredible or they think that this personhas um you know lost sight of you knowof what rigorous science is I wonder ifyou you've had that experience too oflike I I think I I make the mistake oftaking for granted that anybody whofollowed me knows that if I postsomething I think it's worth thinkingabout and um you know it's it's beencarefully studied and I didn't have ayou know I didn't have a dog in thefight I read this research and said thiscleared the bar not only of an academicJournal um but I read the methods and Ifound them sound enough that we ought tobe discussing this idea um have you hadthat experience too um I certainly haveand I should say that you know I wasweaned in an academic culture threeseparate mentors very different stylesall of whom um were excellent mentorsbut all of whom taught me that you knowthere are phenomenal papers where theevery bit of information in the paperand indeed how it's written from startto finish is just watertight andincredible and there are other papersthat are less watertight butoccasionally there will be papers whereone data point in a figure is intriguingenough to consider following that scentTrail in your own work even if the restof the paper is kind ofeh I mean one data point now thatdoesn't mean taking one data point andcasting it out to millions of people onsocial media as an actionable item is isis valid that's certainly not what I'msaying but what I do realize and and I'mrealizing again now what you just saidis that indeed people don't know thecontext under which like what like whatfilters are we working with before webring things forward and I think that umyou know my belief is that if it'sgrounded firmly in the scientific methodthat um that's the best starting placewe were talking about that earlier and Ialso understand that scientists differtremendously in how they look at eventhe same data in the same paper so thereis no governing body that says okay thispaper means blank the authors have theirinterpretation the students have theirinterpretation in fact the course I usedto teach um to undergraduates which grewinto a very large course we would learnto ask four questions what's thequestion that the authors were askingsometimes a sub question what methodsdid they use what did they find and thenwhat did they conclude and does itrelate back to the original question andthat simple um breaking out of fourquestions of study is essentially what Ido for all studies um but I have my wayof doing it and it's going to differfrom the way that other people do it umsocial media uh I think what'sinteresting is that I think there'salways going to be a core following of aof a given person like your yourfollowers that they're going to trustyou know not necessarily across theboard but there there's a generalacceptance of ideas coming through Ithink that on social media it's hard tostrike a balance between setting thewhole context and the action willtakeways I get criticized a lot for notbeing concise enough and I agree but Ibut also get criticized for puttingthings taking things out of context souh such a tight rope walk it's a tightRPP walk and it's always going to be atight RPP walk and so I'm going to justyou know keep going and I know you willtoo um and and listen I I'm there'sthere's some kids out there it's surelynot going to be that are going to takeour jobs eventually and um and we'llfind a way to do it much better whoknows through AI or something might berobots um I feel like this is anappropriate place to ask about somethingelse since we're talking about sort ofpercept of of of others and and gleaninginformation overcoming blind spots it'ssomething that you've written about someyears ago now I guess it would be almost8 years ago now um aboutauthenticity um you know the wordauthenticity is is such a mindfield sucha mindfield I was going to say such hassuch a gravit positive gravitationalpull like oh they're really authentic asopposed to what's the opposite ofauthentic fake right but um I think wecould all learn to draw some linesbetween authenticity and oversharingright how do we gauge authenticity andwe can refer people to that article youwrote some years ago I think um you mayhave written it differently where to bewritten today but you talked in thatarticle about somebody who essentiallydecided to tell everyone that he workedwith all the things that he wasinterested in um uh doing with themrelating to them and it did not servehim well okay so that's authen right andso then there's this um this notion ofbenevolent deception in order topreserve relationship and in importantlyum it brought about a word that we don'thear about very often but that I Irather like which is edicate likethere's so for social media by the way Iapply classroom rules I'll tolerate anycomment in the comment section but notthe sort of comment that I wouldn'ttolerate in a classroom if you startinsulting other you can insult me but ifyou want to insult other people I'm notgoing to tolerate that so um that'swhere I draw the line classroom rulesthere's an etiquette and I think that umetiquette is important so how do webalanceauthenticitywith etiquette and also with preservingone's uh uh one's public life or privateor private life right authenticity athome seems important you could be yourcomplete self at home except when youwant to you know physically hit yoursister or brother because they ate yourice cream that's not the right kind ofauthenticity no no it isn't I think wellthere I think it's such a rich andcomplicated topic I think F first thingis like I I don't want people to bedisingenuous ever but I have a realproblem with people saying as an excusefor disrespectful Behavior well I wasjust being myself um I think Davidsedera said yes but yourself is an so good so good and I think Ithink what people forget is that we havewe all have multiple selves right youyou I mean you've you've you've knownthis your whole career um we all havemultiple identities we also could thinkabout yourself as your thoughts youremotions um your values your personalityso which facet of yourself are youtrying to be true to um I would arguethat authenticity without boundaries iscareless authenticity without empathy isselfish and part of being authentic iscaring about other people's values thatshould one of your values so what thatmeans concretely is I don't think weshould worry about being authentic towhat we're thinking and feeling in anygiven moment I think what we want to askis what I'm about to do or sayconsistent with my principles andsometimes that means you will be falseto your personality in order to be trueto your values sometimes that means youwill you will feel like you're nothonoring your thought or your emotion inthe moment um but you're doing that witha broader view toward who is the personthat I want to be there was a culturalcritic Lon trilling who wrote about theidea of sincerity as opposed toauthenticity and I really like thisdistinction he said when when you whenyou try to think about being authenticyou're trying to bring the inside outand to point Andrew that's not alwaysappropriate or effective he saidsincerity is a little bit more aboutbringing the outside in so pay attentionto the person you claim to be and thentry to become thatperson and that was a little bit of anaha moment for me I realized you knowthere there are all these people who saywell you should you know you should youshould walk yourtalk and I think that's good advice Imight even go a step further and say youknow maybe you should only talk it ifyou're already walkingit maybe maybe that would help us avoidhypocrisy but I think the the thefundamental message here is that uh wewe all we we all could be authentic toone part of ourselves and inauthentic toanother part and I think the mostimportant part is to ask what do I standfor and if I'm what I'm about tocommunicate is not consistent with thatthen maybe maybe I couldself-censor such great advice and um Isuppose uh one has to wonder about thethe role of a emotional states you knowI think there arecareer-ending mistakes that people makein a moment um especially onlinenowadays and by the way this is not justfor people who are already establishedin their career I've heard stories andthere seem to be more and more of thesein the news ofof for instance you know videos ofthings that people said some yearsearlier getting them ejected fromcollege um a guest on Lex Friedman'spodcast who works in the SecuritiesWorld said that one of the lessons thathe teaches his kids is to not filmthemselves doing bad things but in andof course also not to do bad things butin general to just not film themselvesdoing anything because of hisunderstanding of the risk of of doingthat and we don't want to create aparanoia but um gosh I mean who you arewhen when you're 14 is a very differentperson than who you are when you're 27and when you're 50 so I hope so you knowand umso yeah I think you know balancingauthenticity across the lifespan andwe're expecting young minds to do thisand clearly older Minds can't do iteither I mean I I this is a prettywell-known case of a chair of a majorPsy the major Psychiatry Department umwe won't name the university but umbasically lost his job for a singletweet he just was not being thoughtfulin fact he was being um really um likenumb to to other people and lost his joband and I think he Pro I don't know himum and it was obvious why he lost it Idon't think it was debatable but um goshyou think about somebody who's a chairof Psychiatry which means they're apsychiatrist which means they're trainedto think aboutthinking and there you go it's amazinghow common this is and I think one ofthe things that'sfascinating to me is I guess this goesback to something we were talking abouta moment agobut I I think that when when wecommunicate we have access to the sumtotal of all of our thoughts andeverything we've ever ever said that wecan remember and we forget that otherpeople only have a snapshot and so oneof the questions I I like to ask is ifthis was the only post that somebody sawof mine would I be proud of it would Icommunicate who I am and who I aspire tobe oh that's so good if the answer is nomaybe I should pause before I put thatout there that that is excellent adviceif it were the only post like you're oneand only representing you oh fantasticthat now that could be paralyzing ifyou're a perfectionist you'll never postbut I think for somebody who's postingregularly um it's a good filter to justask um am I you know am I beingthoughtfulenough so good I won't add anything tothat just say I'll just say so so goodlet's talk about"

            "text": "potential I was in junior high schooland I remember having a social studiesteacher who she just would go on and onabout potential she had a specialprogram after school you could getinvolved potential potential potentialum and we hear about this and you knowwe have untapped potential you hearwe're only operating at 40% of ourabilities you know people will say thatum the implication is that we havereservoirs of potential that we're justnot accessing because we're not doingthe right thing thinking the rightthings um I know you've now researchedthis topic extensively you have a newbook on this topic um tell us aboutpotential like do we all have hugereservoirs of potential that we are notaccessing and of course I and everyoneelse wants to know how can we accessthose but maybe you could also tell ussome of the myths around potential andyeah tell us about tell us aboutpotential such a such a uh sticky topicfor all the right reasons thank you I uhyou know it's one of those things thingswhere you you've had this experience I'msure many times where you start thinkingand talking about a topic and yourealize it's it's been your whole lifebut you didn't see it until then uh andI feel that way about potential I thinkthat I've been passionate about helpingpeople achieve their potential as longas I can remember I think every everygoal I've ever set has been aboutstretching my potential in one way oranother um or at least realizing it andwhat I've become so struck by as I'vestudied this topic is we all have hiddenpotential but we don't know how tounlock it so why do we oftenunderestimate our own potential um wejudge ourselves by by our startingabilities um and this is more common forpeople with fixed mindsets but evenpeople with growth mindsets um you try anew skill it doesn't go well and youthink this is not for me I'm not cut outfor this um and then it gets worse whenother people also you know you're notjust underestimating yourself you'realso being under underestimated byothers other people watch you and sayyeah you don't have the you know you'renot a prodigy you're not a natural youdon't have the talent that it takes andI think the big myth there is that rawtalent is the most important driver ofHow High people climb um it's notmotivation and opportunity uh mattermore than raw ability for growthmotivation and opportunity yeah um youknow obviously you know everybody startsat a different point um but how closeyou come to your potential is much moreabout the character skills you cultivateum to to improve and improving over timeand then whether you're in a situationwhere you know you you have access tothe knowledge that you need and thetools you need to keep growing and soyou know a concrete example of this forme is um when I when I started diving Iwas way too late I picked it up as ateenager uh a lot of the elite divers inthe world start by fivegoodness and actually in China they'rethey're handpicked by for body type andsent to a version of diving boardingschool where they don't even teach kidshow to swim uh they tie a rope aroundthem so that they can just pull themback after after they they hit the waterin the deep end what part of their bodythey tie a rope around uh I think it'stheir waste so they're diving with arope so that when they get in the waterthey're not wasting any energy exactlythey're just being dragged through thewater and out that's uh that's myunderstanding of it um wow but PR okaythey have to walk they have to climbyeah okay so there a bunch of otherthings they have to do yeah but the thethe swimming apparently is verysecondary anyway um so I started reallylate and Ilacked most of the things that you wouldwant as a diver um I I couldn't touch mytoes without bending my knees uh myteammates called me Frankenstein becauseI was so stiff when I walked uh solacking the flexibility I have no rhythmmy coach brought a metronome to practiceone day and I couldn't even keep thebead uh so you know you think aboutdiving as a sport of Grace nope and thenI also couldn't jump and I couldn'ttwist either and it's like you'remissing the explosive power you don'thave the the athleticism um and I thinkif I had if I had just looked at thoseabilities I had no business being adiver and in fact no business being anathlete I'd already been cut from theMiddle School basketball team threetimes I didn't make the high schoolsoccer team those were the two sports Ihad poured a decade into like this isgoing nowhere umEric just the most incredible coach Icould ever imagine he said to me on thefirst day of practice uh he said umyou know yes you're missing all thesethings but I believe if you if you pouryourself into this sport that you couldbe a state finalist by the time youfinish high school and he saw morepotential in me than I saw in myself andthat just lit a fire underme and um you know what that translatedinto is a lot of the behaviors that thatyou and I have both studied um you knowsetting specific difficult goals for Iwant to learn these Dives that seemought to reach um for uh you know I wantto increase my score over the next threemeets by 10 points um for I want tolearn how to you know all my limitationsnotwithstanding one thing that I canmaster that I have total control over ishow clean I go into the water um I canget a rip entry so that there's nosplash and that's the most importantpart of a dive and one of the greatestcompliments I ever got as a diver was Icame out of a meet in um it was coupleyears and I think I was maybe a juniorin high school and uh one of the judgesturned to Eric and said all he can do isrip and Eric said solike yes it's awesome it's almost likesaying all he can do is win you know ityeah it it was a great backhandedcompliment but Eric was like listen hemade the dive it has a degree ofdifficulty maybe he didn't jump as highas he wanted maybe his tight his tuckwasn't as tight as he wanted um but atthe end of the day like that divedisappeared straight up and down intothe water you can't not give that aseven um and that ended up serving mereally well and so I think the thebroader lesson here for me was Eric saidto me um actually last year uh I neverthought about this he said uh I nevergot close to even qualifying for Olympictrials like I did not have the talent toto be that good but I got way betterthan I ever expected and uh Eric said tome he said looking back uh he said yougot further with less Talent than everyany diver I've ever coached and that wasso meaningful to me and what it remindedme was um my priest accomplishments werenot in the areas where I started outwith the most Talent they were in theareas where I had overcome the mostobstacles and I think that to me is umreally what drives people aroundpotential is to say um it's notperformance that's motivating it's asense ofprogress I love that story and I and Icouldn't agree more I mean I think umLord knows my favorite Topic in scien isthe course I performed at least after myfreshman year which was abysmal um leastwell in the phase when I was doing wellwhat class was it it's neuraldevelopment I now teach neuraldevelopment neural development how badwere you it at first uh okay well I haveto put it in context my high school andfreshman year of college were wereabysmal right I basically no place beingthere I can only thank my high schoolgirlfriend for um being so wonderfulthat I followed her off to college andended up there um left after my freshmanyear came back and then at that point itwas like a step function I worked out offear and excitement and love of thematerial um I I was a straight A studentthereafter but in my senior year senioryear excuse me I took a course in neuraldevelopment which was extremelychallenging um and I got a B+ and thatB+ still gets me you know but it's atopic that I love the most it's what Idid my um graduate thesis on it's what Iteached um at Stanford among othertopics and um and I like to think now Ihave I guess humility had considerableMastery over over the the material butit's because I didn't do as well as Iwould have liked and I applied myself somuch and I think that it just didn'tcome naturally to me and then eventuallyover time you you kind of get it or youget um you get it um so it's it but it'sstill my favorite topic because it wasthat friction point right it's theratcheting through and there's somethingI don't know that's just sointrinsically satisfying to me I used towatch my Bulldog Mastiff Costello likechewing on a bone or when he was littleon a brick CU you know he had a kind ofa Homer Simpson brain about his objectchoice to chew on and he but and he justlooked like he was in just total Blissit was like this effort um combined withsome intrinsic pleasure of the processand so I think that when one isratcheting through through somethingthat's hard it feels so good that it'salmost better than the outcome like itit it is better than the outcome I Ithink it is and you know it's it'sfascinating because this is why I'malways bothered by people saying plarstrengths because if you do that youwill gravitate to toward the things thatcome naturally to you and you're goingto miss out on the very often the theskill that was hard for you to learn toyour point is one that you end up withgreater Mastery over because you had toput in the extra effort and you end upderiving more more satisfaction out ofthe fact that you know I this was reallytough and I figured it out um you knowimplicit in your story um and maybe"

            "text": "partially explicit in in some parts umwhen I was when I was looking at thecharacter skills that help peoplerealize their potential um and reallyfuel unexpected growth um I I ended upfinding threethat I think are under discussed and umand well supported by science um I thinkthat that basically if you want to reachyour potential or um you know achievemore than you think you're capable ofwe're looking at becoming a creature ofdiscomfort um and embracing things thatare unpleasant or awkward for you uhthat would be the first thing the secondis um is being a sponge and soaking upnew information and also filingfiltering out what might not be usefuland then the third is um is being animperfectionist which is knowing when toaim for excellence and when to settlefor good and I I hear all of thosethemes in your story um I you know thatwas OB obvious viously uncomfortablelike you got a B+ you don't want to doany more neuraldevelopment not at all it was it was sofrustrating and so exciting to me at thesame time and then I went everything Idid in the five or seven years thatfollowed was all about learning moreabout this topic because I and it wasn'tabout performing well or proving myselfI just I I love the material so muchmore because of how challenging it wasand I'm grateful to you Ben Reeseprofessor at UC Santa Barbara incredibleneuron anatomist and teacher of neuraldevelopment and and laboratory scienceien because um you know I think had Igotten an an a I don't know that I wouldhave fallen in love with it in the sameway isn't that weird you wouldn't havehad to work at it to discover what wasfun about it I imagine no absolutely andit's still one of my favorite topics toteach um and learn about so youmentioned discomfort being a sponge SLfilter if I got that right and animperfectionist um yeah tell me moreabout the imperfectionist piece becauseI feel like um I've had students in mylab and I've known people in otherdomains of life that they're they'reabsolutely paranoid about shippingsomething out for the world to see itand of course like no one wants to putstuff out into the world that isn'tright and God forbid could be wrong butum or that's going to embarrass us soyou can understand why people areperfectionists but I never reallyunderstood that the uh the extremeperfectionist like how do they ever doanything and and are they happy peoplecuz I imagine that they are no I meanthis is so Thomas Curran I think is theworld's leadest leading psychologiststudying perfectionism and if you lookat his meta analyses uh perfectionism isa recipe for Burnout and depression andanxiety because you're constantlycomparing yourself to an ideal that'sunachievable um perfectionists um arenot they do get better grades in schoolslightly but they don't do any better atwork than their peers because I think inschool you have a predictable outcome uhyou have a general sense of what's goingto be on a test and if you study hardenough you can come closer to the A+whereas at work performance is much morenebulous and so what happens toperfectionists a lot of times is theyend up um optimizing the things that arepredictable and controllable and thenyou know sort of missing the forest andthe trees and I think the you know thethe antidotes um as far as I know reallyhave to to do with calibration so youknow I talked earlier about um how Ilike to ask for a zero to 10 to find outyou know am I in the ballpark or notwell one my biggest liabilities as as adiver was I was never satisfied with myscore and one day Eric said to me youknow you you hear Olympic judges talkabout commentators talk about theperfect 10 that's a misnomer um if youlook at the diving rule book a 10 is forexcellence not for Perfection there's nosuch thing as a Flawless dive I can lookat Dives that have gotten straight tensand point out 19 things that were wrongwith them but they were excellent and sothen we had to define the standards ofexcellence so what I have as arecovering perfectionist somebody whoyou know just beat myself up constantlyin fact I got um we did paper plateAwards on my swim team and one year Iwas given the if only award and there'sa little cartoon in me and it says ifonly I had pointed my left pinky toe Iwould have gotten an eight and a halfinstead of an eight and that was likethe story of my my diving career and Idid not want to be that person anymoreand so one of the things I've learned todo is to when I start anything um youknow if I sit down to write a book I'maiming for a nine uh and the reason forthat is I'm going to pour a couple yearsof you know my work life into this topicum you know hopefully a lot of peopleare going to read it and I want to makesure it's truly the best work I canproduce social media post I'm okay witha seven like if I'm only shooting for anine I'm not going to post very oftenbecause you're nine your ceiling fornine is or your threshold for nine is isso exceedingly it's high yeah and I wantit to keep getting higher over time somy idea of a nine today is much morechallenging than it was 10 years ago andI think this is this is what peopleprobably don't do enough um especiallyif you're an extreme perfectionist isthey don't realize okay um Let me let mefigure out how important this task isand then for this task a six issufficient uh so that then I can pour myenergy into you know pulling the theseven and a half toward a nine where itreally matters um and inevitably if youdon't do that what you will do is youwill get a bunch of nines on things thatare completely trivial I went to a highschool where we had a couple kids get umperfect on the SAT they were the biglike centerfold list of all the earlyadmissions to all the fancy IV Leagueschools definitely was not on that listI don't even know if I yeah I don't evenknow if I was anywhere uh near that listum probably not um and some of them havegone on to have terrific lives and seempretty happy and I know a number of themand in contact with them and um I thinkfor some of them that performedexceedingly well on standardized testsearly on umI hear a bit more dismay in their intheir current life not all but um isthere I have to

Lifepodcast for five years where I was youknow taking the core of myorganizational psychology work andtrying to take on a topic and and makeit interesting and useful to people andthen realizing I was feeling constrainedjust to focus on work and as apsychologist there are lots of otherthings I want to take on and so weexpanded into um this second showrethinking and I have some experimentsI'm tempted to try but I've been reallyhesitant to do them so um did you watchwrestling growing up ever professionalwrestling um I did watch a little bit ofit and then for whatever reason in thelast year uh my good friend Rick Rubinwho's he's like not obsessed but he is areal devotees he's a fan of professionalwrestling he had me watch some um WWEbut even aew he was explaining that it'sbasically physical drama he's explainingwhy it's so intriguing to him and soinformative to him and then uh I'm a bigfan of of certain genre of music andLars Frederickson from ransett is a is ahuge wrestling fan so now got multiplepeople that have come into contact withthey like telling me all this stuffabout wrestling so wrestling seems to becropping up more and more all right so Idon't know the first thing aboutwrestling I think I caught it a fewtimes as a kid likewise it was HulkHogan and a few others passed acrossscreen yeah yep y but the the thing thatI remember was loving the tag teammatches where you know somebody wouldget overpowered and then they pull insomebody to help I it would be sointeresting if there was a podcast whereyou take issues that peoplefundamentally disagree on and you starta debate and then somebody can tag in ifthey want to challenge an argument andso instead of concent concentrating onthe particular guests you have youbasically have a problem you're tryingto you know to get to the roots of andyou're going to have all these peoplejump in and and hopefully build toward amore insightful perspective on it I haveno idea if this is going to work I'dreally love to try it and this is thefirst time I've spoken out loud about itbecause I'm like I I don't know that Iwant to like that I want to see thatcrash and burn and yet like why not likewhat's the risk I think it's so cool funright yeah what what topics are are uhare you thinking about covering becauseI can think of some pretty prettycontroversial topics um but I want toknow what the ones you're thinking aboutwell I mean I literally just I mean I'mthinking out loud here but one one thatI think on the controversial front thatwould be could be really rich is um tothink about policies for Trans athletesin sports that's a controversial topichugely controversial but also I've I'vetalked to some experts on this I I'vetalked to some trans athletes um and thepeople who are deep in this do not knowwhat they think the policy should be andso I I think actually hearing them talkand you know understanding thecomplexity of those issues and then youknow maybe hammering out what what's apolicy you would propose for schoolswhat would you want for you know forOlympic events um I I just think thatwould be fascinating and I'd love to I'dlove to moderate that discussiongoodness uh maybe I would I wouldn't Idon't want to wait into that one I'mglad you would I wouldn't that seemslike one of the most barbed wire topicsone could ever um embark on which isexactly why I'm going to put in my voteyou absolutely should do this podcast Ithink it's an amazing idea actuallyfolks put in the comment section onYouTube whether or not Adam should dothis podcast and and that topic inparticular I think it would be amazingbecause um one thing that I keep comingback to in my own mind is that a lot ofthe controversies out there stem fromthe fact that we very often haveindividuals pitted against individualsyes and there's so much lost in that umand I think about science and going backto the scientific method where we havesubfields pitted against subfields whenwhen you talk about a field like therewas huge controversy over the structureof DNA and it wasn't one individualagainst another what you had are smallgroups different camps and there wassome partial overlap there's also youknow if you read the double helix therewas also a lot of uh uh comp Behaviorpeople entering romantic relationshipsjust to G information from the otherside you know human beings not not attheir finest um but in any event smallpanels arguing competing teams competingI think is um far more interesting andinformative than individuals you knowbutting heads I think so too and I thinkum you know another another one that Ithink would be really interesting I meanI'm like people always say great mindsthink alike no great minds challengeeach other to think differently and wejust don't do enough of that so I I'vebeen thinking a lot politically likewhat if we brought together a bunch ofpeople um who are not ideologues but arereally interested in pragmatic policysolutions to rewrite the Constitution ifwe were going to build one today You'like to tackle big stuff I just I know Ilove it I love it it's a compliment it'sa compl I mean what are the odds like Isaid earlier no weak sauce no weak saucelike you just you're you go right for itI mean these listen these are the issuesthat people are really activated bybecause these are really core issuesthey get down to the autonomic nervoussystem they're in the hypothalamus as wesay but I don't think they should belike I look at these topics and think Ijust want to get it right like I don'thave a vested interest in what the modelshould be I just know that even thewisest people of 250 years ago we notprepared to anticipate the world we livein today and we ought to be constantlylike I don't know I don't think youshould live in a world where you affirmyour beliefs uh I think the only way youlearn is by continually evolving yourbeliefs and so I guess I'm trying tofigure out more ways to catalyze thataround issues people care about but Idon't care about the issues I care aboutthe stretching of thinking and theimproving the way that the world workswell I'll tell you if you decide to dothis podcast with a tag team form I lovethat you gleaned it from watchingwrestling a couple of times um aroundthese uh very controversial issues uh Ipromise you that will be one of of themost popular and important podcasts onthe planet Earth might be podcasts onother planets I hear that they're youknow galaxies far far away with a theymay have podcast too may have had themfor much longer than we have but umthat's uh that's a winner yeah wellmaybe maybe I'll try it as a littleexperiment on the rethinking feed andsee if it's an unmitigateddisaster well you know where my votelies I I appreciate that so okay so togo back to your question for a second onthe macro side I've always thought itwould be fun to try to write a Sci-Finovel and the question I'm wrestlingwith right now is is that a good use ofmy time like there are great sci-fiwriters out there there aren't that manysocial scientists communicating aboutthe topics that I do and it feels likeit might be I don't know I'm like thisis it might be too much of a diversionthen again uh according to your words umyou had no talent in diving but youexceeded all all uh performance metricsum by by considerable amount uh throughmotivation and um and opportunity I gotthat right um I vote Yes uh I'm not Ihaven't read much sci-fi maybe I need toread read more sci-fi are you a fan ofsci-fi I love sci-fi it's it's one of myfavorite ways to imagine a better worldand also you know prevent a worse onefrom emerging but I don't know there's athere's a part of me that thinks all"

magic but I know thatyou were a professional magician at atone point in your life um and that youyou did this presumably because youenjoy doing it um but getting beyond thethe sort of uh pull the rabbit out ofthe hat or pick or identify the cardthat the person picked out of the theshuffled stack um what is it and whatwas it about magic that intrigues youdoes it inform anything about um thework that you do now it does yeah I yeahI think it when I started I was 12 and Iwas just it was just fun and I waslooking for a way to entertain otherpeople and entertain myself in theprocess and then you know became achallenge can I learn this new skill andcan I can I master this trick I think umnerdiest thing I did in college was Istarted a magic club with David Quangwho is a a stellar magician and Cruverbalist as he calls it Cru verbalisthe does um magic crossw puzzlesessentially that I I can't do it justiceyou have to see it it's unreal um and Iwatched him for you know our firstperformance together and realized one ofus is going to make it as a magician andit's not me uh he's he's outstandinganyway um the way it figures into mywork now is I think so much of goodscience communication ismisdirection and it's the same skill Iuse as magician if I told you that thethe card you picked was about todisappear from the deck and appear onthe window you would not be nearly asintrigued as if it happened by surpriseand I think the same is true when whenwe communicate knowledge I think it'sit's actually why so many of my postsyou flagged this earlier so many of myposts start with um you know this thingis not what you think it's actually thisother thing um I think that you knowchallenging conventional wisdomquestioning assumptions is is whatsurprises people um and then leads themto think either I have something tolearn or Oh no I got to put up a shieldbecause my beliefs are being umchallenged or attacked and I think thethe art form of magic was always aboutcreating a surprise that would Delightpeople um as opposed to Leading peopleto feel like they were tricked or dupedor manipulated and so I think the thechallenge for me is to say Okay I wantto figure out what what we know fromBehavioral Science um you know mostlyfocusing on psychology because that's mycore expertise um what do we know that'sactually different from most intuitionand then how do I explain that in a waythat surprises people but leads them tosay oh that's so interesting as opposedto that's wrong and then want to fightabout it it's almost as if you give themthe experience of what you're trying toteach them so that the oh that's wrongcan't uh be the available responresponse yes because in Magic you knowit's it's um everyone knows it's magicjust like with professional wrestlingFolks by the way it there's there's someprior understanding of of what's goingto happen maybe they go off script but Ithink that's actually I think part ofthe interest in professional wrestlingfor those that are extreme fans ofprofessional wrestling is that theyalmost want to wonder about whether ornot some of it is not in the plan likeit's a suspension of of realthat they seem to enjoy right because ifyou know something's fake or well weshould we should be I should be morecareful about my language in with magiclike when I went see aie I mean I Idon't think it's actual magic but he'sable to give the illusion of Magic thereal illusion is that it's magic rightit's not the illusion of making the cardhop to somewhere else in the room um andhe is phenomenal and I highly recommendpeople go see his show if they if theyget the opportunity but the I thinkthey're doing a documentary about himnow actually there'll be some Netflixstuff as well um but it's the illusionthat magic exists That's soexciting um so with sciencecommunication yeah I always um aim for"

it's alsosurprising so interesting clearactionable and surprising sort of is thethe ultimate if there's sort of a like aoh I didn't realize that but it's it'shard to find data points that satisfyall four criteria and the surprising isthe least important by far um I assumetable Stakes is it's rigorous oh wellokay sitting underneath all four ofthose points are uh that it's scci thatit's actual science right someone didn'tjust say it right it's not conjecture orTheory so that means that there's datato support it and that the data werecollected with with the appropriateamount of rigor right so there's athere's a reservoir of stuff that sitson underneath as a foundation so G giventhe the Baseline of rigor how do I findwhat's interesting clear actionable andhopefully surprising although I would Iokay I would make a case there's aclassic article that Murray Davis wroteone of my all-time favorites he was a asociologist who wrote a paper calledthat's interesting and he opened thepaper by saying um ideas live notbecause they're true but because they'reinteresting which decimated one of mycore beliefs like I I thought it wasaccuracy that drove people's beliefbeliefs and he said no ideas livebecause they're interesting and then hegoes to build an index of theinteresting to explain when people areintrigued and his case is that most ofinterest is surprise and he breaks downall the ways that you can turnconventional wisdom upside down you cansay that um something you thought wasbad was actually good or vice versa youcan argue that um something you thoughtwas homogeneous is actuallyheterogeneous uh you could argue thatsomething you thought was individual wasactually a collective phenomenon or viceversa and he he's got this wonderfulbreakdown of of all the ways of beinginteresting and he's the one who madethe distinction between ideas thatchallenge weekly held assumptionsintriguing you and strongly heldassumptions um you know sort ofoffending you but I think from Davis'sView and I think he's right a hugeamount of interest is surprise and sobut I don't think it's the only driverof Interest so I might I might take yourcriteria and say okay we start withriger um we want to go to interestClarity and actionability how do we getto interest let's build a submodel ofthe fact that drive interest andsurprise might be it might have thebiggest beta weight in the regressionequation um but what else what elsedrives interest I have a couplehypothesis I want to hear yours umyou've been doing this actively um andhighly effectively Beyond surprise whatelse interests people in yourcontent anything that draws onself-reflection for them boom I think weall have an innate desire to betterunderstand ourselves why why we work theway we do why we don't work as well aswe would like to in certain domains likesome and and cast understanding on onour experiences of others too like ohnow it makes sense like a with goingback to the the kti episodes but we didseveral of them so for um I think it'sappropriate you know to learn from himthat narcissism is Envy it represents aa extreme deficiency in the pleasure umthat people narcissists can have anextreme pleasure drive but they theyalways feel like they have far less thanthey would like to have and that othershave far more of it because don't havethat same yearning for it right and sothat narcissism at its core is deep envythat to me was like wow you know and toto realize that and to Now understandthat all this discussion that you hearout there about narcissist everyonecalling other people narcissist that umthere are genuine narcissists out thereand what they really suffer from is anextreme deficit in pleasure and they'reconstantly envious of others it reframedeverything I thought about narcissistsabout them being overbearing which theycan be and often areum etc etc so I think it's also anythingthat leads to um like oh I can I can Ican navigate narcissist better with thatwell that I mean that checks all yourboxes um it's very surprising becauseit's not the way we normally understandnarcissism but I think you you hit onfor me what's the maybe even it's atleast as important as surprise maybemore so isself-relevance and it doesn't have to beactionable right it has to in a lot ofcases just help you understand or makesense of something that's been puzzlingor that's you know that's um you knowsort of I I think I'm I'm almost alwayssurprised when I say something from youknow here here's here's a synthesis ofresearch here's a metaanalysis and Ithink it's kind of obvious and peopleget excited about it because it gavethem language to describe something theyhad felt but they didn't know how toarticulate or talk about and I thinkthat I mean I think this is why most ofthe most popular TED Talks um are abouthuman behavior um because people areinterested in people um and if you learnsomething about you or about others youdon't have to immediately do anythingwith that uh to find it intriguing andeven useful um because it enriched yourworldview a recent guest on this podcastwe haven't aired it yet but um maybeit'll be out by time this this a waswith Lisa Feldman Barrett she's um Psypsychologist or neuroscientist rightemotion of course yeah and she describedum in how in certain cultures there is alanguage for subcategories of emotionsright so you know she described a wordin Japanese I don't recall what the wordwas um that describes the the feeling ofsadness that one has after getting aparticularly bad haircut something thatI don't think you or I uh are familiarwith but I'm familiar with from myexperience of of romantic partner beinglike really unhappy about their haircutand you're like you're like you're sadbut there but by having a specific wordfor a specific experience people feelless alone and the feeling passes morequickly in time and and then she givessome other examples uh from German andfrom you know uh Scandinavian umlanguages and so forth and I find thisso interesting it's like the momentpeople hear that they are not alone inan experience there's nothing actionableabout it but it it creates a cognitiveshift thereafter in which they sufferless um or may feel more connected toothers I mean I think it's really abeautiful example of of exactly whatyou're referring to like when we learnabout something and we we identify withit it's powerful it's very powerful andI think um psychologists often say name"

thirdstrategy which is literally just todescribe what you're feeling um it it itseems to allow people then to reasonwith and process whatever they'refeeling as opposed to allowing thefeeling to control them and I I probablygot the clearest sense of this and in umin2021 um I wrote a New York Times articleon um on languishing um the feeling ofme orblah and I have never had anything I anyarticle I wrote resonate like this andit just like I all the the PO the postthat tag mate were just like it me it meit us and it was like the like one andtwo word reactions and I I don't thinkit was the content that mattered topeople it was the just having the termum all of a sudden people realized thisis originally Cory Keys's research thatI was referencing um it had been a lightbulb for me to say there's a if youthink about the spectrum of well-beingthis is related to your mental illnessversus mental health distinction umthose are two extremes of the Continuumand one end we have depression andburnout on another end we have you knowwell-being and flourishing languishinglives right in the middle as Coreydescribes it it's the absence ofwell-being so you're not depressed youstill have hope you're not burned outyou still have energy but you're not atPeak functioning you're missing a senseof purpose um you feel like you'restagnating and you're empty and you knowthere was something about just sayingthe word languishing that led people toto realize yeah that's a thing and ofcourse we're languishing we're standingstill in the middle of a a globalexperiment that no one opted into whichviolates all rules of consent um by byscience last time I checked um but Ithink that that that's something thatthat probably is under represented whenwe're trained to communicate asscientists to say one of the mostvaluable things we do is we give peoplelanguage to talk about things and Ithink that's a massive part of um ofyour impact is uh this is one of the bigthings I've learned from you Andrew is II I used to be a little bit dismissiveof um of cognitive Neuroscience inparticular I thought understanding thebrain has not taught me that much aboutthe mind like being able to you knowTraceum uh let's take a simple example likewhen I read Joe Leo's research beingable to trace um you know certain umamydala responses um you know as theroot of how people deal with fight ORFflight and and threat I'm like I don'tknow that that helped me that much likeif I could just describe fight or flightdo I need the amydala and you'veconvinced me I was wrong about thatbecause when people have when theyunderstand the um the neurologicalsubstrates of their thoughts feelingsand actions um they believe them morethey're like oh like there is amechanism for this it's being producedinside my head and even though I can'tsee it um it's there and it can bestudied with the tools of science um Ithink that's a really big deal and I Ireally regret the fact that I didn'tspend more time on cognitiveNeuroscience because I think I'd be abetter Psy a better psychologist todayoh well again thanks for the kind wordsI think that um a fortunate evolution inour fields or even field if I may umover the last 10 years is that whereasNeuroscience itself even needs to besubdivided into neur Anatomy and theneurophysiology it's lumped into allNeuroscience but it now includespsychology computational Neurosciencecognitive Neuroscience it's all you knowI think I I consider us um you know wehave different perspectives anddifferent training obviously but doing alot of the same things um just uh usingdifferent um different dissection toolsand different different language basedtools and listen what you've done uh Iwon't even say masterfully I mean justwith like extreme virtuosity is to wrapyour hands around such an enormousliterature related to psychology I meanthe human mind and behavior and thoughtprocesses and emotions and potential andyou know so many topics and to um andto extract the the most valuable gemsfrom that literature and communicatethem in a way that anyone can understandand um this is it's an extreme gift uhto be able to do that and it's um andit's clear it's working because like youmentioned this article on languishingwhich we will provide a reference to ora link to in our caption because I wantto go read read that now I mean I'malways struck by this feeling of like amI I'm not tired but you know like I'vegot tons to do but like why do I justwant to like sit here for a and I'm likemaybe I need to sit here but then youget into all the like the well okay butyou know I need to there's a lot to dothere's a lot to get up and go I don'twant to waste my life and yeah rest isgood too but I think languishing issomething that like like I definitelycan resonate with that so when I had abulldog it felt a lot easier to do cuzhe was always languishing but uhdo you ever just languish or are youbusy enough that you you just feel likeyou're always a forward Center of M Ithink everybody languishes I think it'spart of the human condition and I thinkit might even be evolutionarily adaptivebecause I I remember um another sort ofuh mind-altering idea I remember readingRandy nessie's argument that milddepression could be evolutionarilyfunctional that you know obviouslyclinical depression um is debilitatingin a lot of ways but you know low gradsadness um Lincoln's Melancholy um weknow one of one of the things it can dois broaden your field of vision um andyou know for for many people sadness isa signal that something is not workingand it can motivate problem solving umit can in some cases um open access toNew Perspectives um unfortunately thosepotential benefits of sadness are oftenoverridden by the motivational cost andalso the the fact that you now spend allthis time regulating your sadness andwondering why you're sad right and soit's it's hard to harness but um I I hada similar thought about languishing fromthis perspective to say that you knowmaybe moments of languishing open us upto change um when we get stuck uhsometimes we realize you have to movebackward in order to make progress umsometimes you have to unlearn thingsthat you thought you knew um in order toto keepgrowing and um I you know I don't afriend of mine said he read mylanguishing piece and he's like you'renot the languishing type I'm like okaymaybe maybe everybody's Baseline isdifferent like I I think one of thethings I'm I'm really lucky to have ishigh reserves of energy um but for melanguishing is like I felt like I didnothing today um and you know in atypical day like if I'm writing a book Ishould be able to like write a thousandwords I'm proud of and I don't like asingle word that I produced or I sat atmy blinking cursor like staring at thecomputer screen and for the eenth timewondered like do they call it a cursorbecause of all the writers who've cursedit and then I end up like Googlingwhat's the like what are the Latin rootsof the word cursor where did this comefrom and like that is not a good use oftime it's like that's not forward Massthat's like I'm spinning so so good yeahI think everybody languishes um and Iaspire to do it less often but not neverlove it what does cursor what is theroot of cursor people will look it upput hey folks put it in the put it inthe uh comments on YouTube um I did Idid look it up oh good okay you'll tellus no no I I feel like there's a there'sa footnote in Hidden potential and I'mtrying to remember it comes from umkurer I think and um the cursor umoriginally came nope I don't want to doit I'm going to skip it I don't rememberthis is your Hipp your hippocampus issmart enough to have discarded thatinformation and you have more importantthings to do forgive me for asking thequestion folks put in the comments onYouTube so good I have one more questionabout potential you have children"

            "text": "correct three um and a lot of ourlisteners either are children or havechildren um and even for those thatdon't have children I'm curious with thevast array of knowledge that you nowhave about potential and the fact thatkids are these incredible sponges rightthey I mean they they certainlyexperience discomfort we know that theyare sponges we absolutely know thatsometimes they're filters we try andteach them to be filters and andhopefully they areimperfectionists maybe there are kidsthat are just perfectionists by defaultbut I have to imagine that they aren'tbecause standards come about when webecome aware of other people'sperformanceright what sorts of messages doyou recommend parents give their kidsand what sorts of messages are youactually implementing that perhaps aredifferent than you uh were prior toresearching and writing your book onpotential o interesting well the firstthing I should say is um Becky KennedyDr Becky is my favorite source ofinsight on parenting and she's changedthe way I think of the way I think abouta lot of what I do with our kids um butmy wife Allison is she her instinctsabout effective parenting are sosophisticated I feel like every day Ilearned something from watching hercommunicate with our kids and so I Icame in thinking all right write thisbook about potential I'm not going to doa parenting chapter because I wanteverything to be relevant toparents and um sure enough there's achapter that had nothing to do withparenting where I like oh I actually umI'm reading this research and there wasa moment where I did something well andI didn't even mean to do it um and thisis something that I think everyone umprobably underutilizes I don't wantactually that's an over statement Ithink a lot of people um don'tappreciate the importance of of thisapproach to Parenting um and I am tryingto do it more often so um quick quickstory and then I I'll back up into theprincipes so I was uh I was gettingready to give my first T talk a numberof years ago extremely nervous um I'm ashy introvert I was for a long timeafraid of public speaking I remember incollege literally shaking um to raise myhand uh being that nervous and now I'msupposed to get in the red circle um notmy idea of comfort zone and I happen tomention to our oldest daughter that Iwas nervous and I asked her for adviceon what I should do and she said I thinkI think at the time let's see she musthave been think she was seven maybe Ithink seven uh maybe six anyway um shesaid uh look for a smiling face in theaudience[Music]so it was it was one of those momentswhere I'm like oh that's such a goodidea um why didn't I think of that likeyes I can do that I know people who aregoing to be in the audience so I asked acouple of friends to sit in the frontrows and I I locked eyes with a coupleof them and my nerves went down a littlebit so a couple weeks later um Joanna'sgetting ready to be in a school play andshe's also shy and introverted and she'snervous and she asks us foradvice and instead of telling her whatto do I said well what did you suggestto me a few weeks ago and she sheremembered and she said look for asmilingface and it it was it was one of likethe It was one of the most movingmoments um of my life like Allison and Igot to the play and she looked at us andshe beamed and I just um I I think whatI learned from that experiencewas uh kids need to feel that theymatter and most of us think aboutmattering as um you know showing kidsthat they're unconditionally loved andgiving them the support they need but weforget that part of feeling that youmatter is feeling that you make adifference so as a kid feeling like youhave something tocontribute as a parent asking mydaughter for advice that boosted herconfidence and I think that this is umI've come to call this the coach effectuh it's one of my favorite recentfindings in Psychology that uh when whenyou're struggling with something um yourinstinct is to go to somebody else foradvice and say I need guidance theproblem is that keeps you in a passiveframe of mind uh it makes you feel likeyou're dependent on others what you'rebetter off doing is finding somebodyelse with a similar Challenge and givingthem advice and what that does is it itshows you that you have something togive um it boosts your efficacy um theresearch on this by Lauren esis Winklerand colleagues uh is fascinating sopeople who give advice instead ofreceiving it um randomly assigned end upuh more motivated and more confident umand I think this is something everyparent could do right whatever challengeyou think your kid is going to face finda version of it that you're grapplingwith and seek their guidance on it andwhen they run into that same challengethey will have confidence that they canbegin to figure it out on their own andyou can be a coach in that process asopposed to just telling them what to dowhich they may feel like is not relevantor they may resist because they don'twant to be told what to do by a parentso that is my favorite parenting lessonfrom hidden potential I love that and Ilove your statement that you know kidslike adults want to matter you know thatbeing you know we hear you know makethem feel important but so often that'stied to Performance metrics and thoseperformance metrics are the very thingsthat are making them nervous or that arecreating anxiety um I love it um are youtaking additional kids for adoptionbecause I'm I'm raising I'm raising I'mraising my hand I think there'd be a lotmore developmental psychologists in theworld if uh if we chose our careerslatersuper interesting topic and by the wayI'm very much looking forward to readingyour book uh hidden potential um clearlyI have a lot to resolve around thatissue because um I still hear Miss Rolfin the in uh Middle School just tellingme how much potential we have and thatum and that I wasn't accessing mine ohno it's like a voice in the back of myhead um all the time and um even thoughI feel very happy with um U many aspectsof my life that there are a lot ofthings that I want to do that I haven'tdone and I think it's through uh youknow limit limited uh what are they calllimiting self- beliefs or things of thatsort self limiting belief self-limitingbeliefs there you go I can't even saysay the phrase um yeah I do I do thinkall your fans are like yeah that Andrewhuberman really hasn't he hasn't reallytapped his potential at all he'ssquandering at all well keep in mind i'I've lived in a fairly narrow trench ofof pursuit you know at 19 I got intothis and I've been doing this likeresearching and teaching and doing reslike for PR much all I've done for likealmost you heading to 30 years so andyou too you've been in this in this gamefor a long time and that's it's where welike to play but um but what I'velearned from you today in addition tomany other things is that um realizingour potential uh has so much to do withyou know reaching outside we hear aboutour comfort zone but it's also reachinginto our like deeper wishes and thoughtsand uh I I keep coming back to this ideaof the tag team podcast and and theorigins of that in your mind it's like Inever would have expected that but italso reveals something that sounds kindof like intrinsic to you like you maybeyou like to see things play out uh theway you think they should be played outas opposed to the what's clearly a umintractable Battle of loggerheads leastyes that is a that's a core value like Ithink there I can't imagine anunsolvable problem oh I love that man Iwant your I want your brain um listenAdam I want to thank thank you first ofall for taking the time today to cometalk to us certainly not just about yourbook but we covered an enormous range oftopics I mean you talked to us aboutprocrastination which is sort of thethird rail of life for so many people uhcreativity intrinsic extrinsicmotivation and uh blind spotsauthenticity and and so much more butalso I want to thank you for being suchan an active teacher on social media inthe classroom you still run a researchprogram you're doing TED Talks you'rewriting multiple books you know you'reabsolute Phenom in terms of the theamount of information that you'reputting out into the world and I mustsay I always always always learn fromyour posts your podcasts your books likethere are certain people in the worldthey're exceedingly rare but you're oneof them that when they open their mouthpeople learn and they learn valuableknowledge and it it's a it's aincredible thing um to be on thereceiving end and so I just want to sayuh on behalf of myself and everyone elsethank you ever so much for what you doand um please keep going well thank youthat that means a lot to me consideringthe source because I I the sentimentsare mutual uh I think every time Iwhether it's reading one of your postsor seeing one of your reals um I myoverwhelming thought is that is a masterteacher and if I had been lucky enoughto take one of your classes I might havegone more of the Neuroscience Directionwell um and then failed but it would itit would have been interesting to learnmore about at minimum and uh I just havetremendous admiration for yourcommitment to Making Science uminteresting clear and useful to peoplethank you well I consider us on the onthe same team in in that regard and umand I I probably will uh tap you about apotential collaboration it would be somuch fun to sounds like a bless to worktogether um meanwhile again thank youfor everything you're doing and um likeI said just keep going and please comeback again I feel like there are athousand other topics we could talkabout and that we should honored we'lltry not to make you regret that thankyou thank you for joining me for today'sdiscussion with Dr Adam Grant if you're"

    "episode_summary": "In this episode, my guest is Dr. Adam Grant, Ph.D., a professor of organizational psychology at The Wharton School of the University of Pennsylvania, an expert in the science and practical steps for increasing motivation, maximizing and reaching our potential, and understanding how individuals and groups can best flourish. He is also an avid public educator, having written five bestselling books, delivered several top-ranking TED Talks and is the host of two psychology podcasts. We discuss how to overcome procrastination, how to increase intrinsic motivation (even for dreaded tasks), identify blind spots and rethink our assumptions, and how we can build a persistent growth mindset. We also explain tools to improve creativity and discuss the surprising relationship between creativity and procrastination. We then explore how to effectively solicit useful feedback and grow from constructive criticism and how you can improve your level of focus and attention using science-supported methods. We also discuss mental tools to get out of negative thought spirals, how to nurture potential in yourself or others, and the dark side of perfectionism. The discussion delivers more than a dozen science-supported protocols that are readily applicable to anyone seeking to live a more productive, fulfilling, and creative life.\nFor show notes, including referenced articles and additional resources, please visit hubermanlab.com.\nThank you to our sponsors\nAG1: https://drinkag1.com/huberman\nEight Sleep:\u00a0https://eightsleep.com/huberman\nLevels:\u00a0https://levels.link/huberman\nWaking Up: https://www.wakingup.com/huberman\nInsideTracker:\u00a0https://insidetracker.com/huberman\nMomentous: https://www.livemomentous.com/huberman"
