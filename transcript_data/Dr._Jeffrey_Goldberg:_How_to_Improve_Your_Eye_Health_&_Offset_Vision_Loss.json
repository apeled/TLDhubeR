            "text": "go way back we will spare people the discussion about all of that but I'm really excited for today's discussion because I get a tremendous number of questions about vision and Eye Health and of course as a neuroscientist who has worked on the visual system I sometimes have answers or partial answers but more often than not I don't have the answers and yet I'm confident that you do or that if you don't you can direct us to the proper place to get those answers so to kick things off I want to ask you what was one of the most commonly asked questions when I solicited for questions in anticipation of this episode which is how early should one do an eye exam on their child and how regularly should we all be doing eye exams also is the fact that I think I can see normally confirmation that I can see as well as I think I can so that's really three questions but baby comes out do they check their eyes right away and if so how and how often should they check and what kind of information is there yeah it's as a great question it's obviously something that touches us all so the the answer that really differs a little bit uh at the different stages of Life first of all every every baby gets an eye exam or should be getting an eye exam and uh one of the main things that you really just are screening for right when that baby is born right in the nursery right in those first few days is to just look for a red reflex you know when you take a camera picture a Flash picture and sometimes you get red eye that's actually the light from the flash as you know reflecting against the retina coming back out of your eye it looks red and um and a red reflex is actually very normal that's that that's great and if you have a one of a number of diseases in the eye that can present even in babies even in newborn babies including most concerning but thankfully least common retinoblastoma which is the most common pediatric eye cancer which again thankfully is quite rare uh those babies won't have a red reflex in that eye it'll be kind of a whitish or gray reflex and so even just that first little you know doctor's taking the little pen light and even just flashing it in that's in the baby's eyes so that's that's that's our first eye exam and hopefully we've all had that and hopefully every baby being born today is getting that getting that first eye exam is really just looking for that red reflex uh it's not typical as long as that's looking good um to worry about getting an eye exam from there kind of through um childhood like maybe early Elementary School unless they your baby is presenting with one of a number of features that parents often pick up on for example as the baby's aging through those first couple of years you know through the first couple of years babies actually don't have great visual Acuity and so as they're aging over those first couple years it's normal for them to have you know roving eye movements for example be searching their environment but over those first couple of years if parents start noticing the baby isn't you know isn't uh making eye contact or looking where a sound is certainly if they have what's called nystagmus like these rapid flickering alternating eye movements uh anything like that of course you're going to trigger trigger an eye exam but otherwise most babies other than their pediatrician doing that red reflex check when they're in for their regular well child checks uh that's really all that's uh needed through that when most kids get to elementary school age there will often be often done at the schools and amblyopia screening exam if kids eyes either if one eye doesn't see that well like maybe you're very nearsighted or farsighted in one eye and pretty normal sighted in the other or the two refractive errors are quite different from each other that can lead to a condition you've talked about on the podcast before called amblyopia which is probably one of the more common or most common eye diseases of children or if the eyes are in a line you know our eye muscles and the Brain behind them are really responsible for keeping the two eyes looking straight ahead and if that's not working properly and one eye is is off kilter and therefore the image of what we're looking at is falling on different spots of the retina it's not sinking upright in the brain that can lead to this disease condition called amblyopia where that eye is no longer talking to the brain properly and there's a pretty easy screening exam that can be done for strabismus the misalignment of the eyes that kids will do in elementary school the other main presenting symptom of kids in elementary school is when they admit to their parents I can't see the board or I can't see the teacher up front and then they might be quite nearsighted and so that will also trigger an exam and so those are usually the parts for for babies for toddlers for children school-aged children that might reasonably trigger an exam a couple of questions about early eye exams and we'll um get on to uh eye exams in older visuals in a "

            "text": "second but I want to interrupt you with this question so you mentioned that um you know there can be a misalignment of the eyes I've seen many people's babies where there is one eyeball that seems to be kind of drifting around and then it might correct but sometimes they'll have a we don't want to get technical here for our listeners we'll keep it General but either convergent eyes or one eye converging cross eyes or walleyed you know again using uh that non-technical language here um and my understanding is that the brain is taking that information in and it's very plastic it's changing at these early stages of development and that it's fairly critical to get that stuff corrected early on because if you wait too long the brain can essentially become blind to the the um or rather the the brain cannot learn to handle the proper alignment so in other words if a kid has cross eyes crossed eyes excuse me and they're not corrected uh until their 20s it's possible that they will never recover normal vision whereas if you recover if you align the eyes properly early in development they can indeed recover Vision how early can and should one consider getting those eye realignments done yeah yeah pretty much right on what they'll do is if they detect any eye misalignment and sometimes parents are are good at noticing that and sometimes you take a picture and one eye got the red eye reflex and the other one didn't and sometimes people notice that their kids eyes are sort of turning in it seems like too much um sometimes there's what's called pseudostrabismus which is where actually depending on your Anatomy if you have a little extra skin sort of on the inside corners of your eyes it makes your eyes look turned in when actually they're straight but if your eyes are actually turned in or slightly less common in children more common in adults misalignment turned out it's really important to correct that early and the reason is as you were saying the brain starts ignoring it it fails to fully develop the straw wrong connections from the for the data coming in from one of those two eyes into the brain and if you pass certain sort of thresholds during development during childhood without correcting that connectivity getting those two eyes to work together properly you can permanently lose that um and so we use sort of we used to use very sort of uh you know gross numbers like it's fully correctable if you can intervene before age three it's partly correctable if you can intervene before age six you got a chance before age nine but it turns out in follow-on studies that even kids into their young teens have a shot at correcting that I brain connection that amblyopia that that loss of vision uh that that can occur during early development so even if you're only you know unfortunately detecting that later on in childhood or even sort of the tween years or early teen years it's still worth a try to really push to um retrain the weaker eye and then also realign the muscles so that they can work together to keep the eyes focused I'll tell you it's interesting and there's a lot more to learn about brain plasticity and probably a lot of really cool new therapies yet to discover that could reopen what's called critical period plasticity this this this plasticity that we have during development that kind of goes away as we age and and that critical period plasticity as you know has been the best studied actually in the visual system and the idea that we could reopen that is really fantastic but for different parts of that ibrain connection there's different periods for critical period plasticity for example even if you get the amblyopic eye to see well again and then you realign the eyes and now they're working together a lot of kids will never recover full depth perception stereopsis the use of two eyes to see depth for example so why that part of the brain doesn't correct as well as the visual Acuity or central vision part of the brain I'm not sure if we understand that yet I'm going to ask for a curbside consult as sometimes called right now by telling you a story when I was a kid I went swimming without goggles and I had one eye closed and the other eye open and closing as it went in and out of the water because I'm a deficient swimmer and I only breathe to one side unless I really consciously forced myself to breathe to both sides in a freestyle swim got out of the pool and I was seeing double it was pretty eerie and then it became downright scary because I didn't recover my double vision until they patched one of the eyes to forcing me to use the other eye that had been closed the entire time and fortunately this was done early enough and it I was young enough that within I think it was about a day or so I restored what normal vision however my depth perception is terrible um I'm the kid that you know Fly ball was hit to me in the Outfield and it's coming it's coming and then it hit me this is why I've generally focused on foot Sports throughout my entire life as opposed to you know precise hand-eye coordination I'm better at throwing darts and things with one eye closed than I ever would be with both eyes maybe that's true for most people question I have is is it true that even just a few hours of misalignment of information to the two eyes early in development can permanently rewire the brain unless there are some corrective measures such as patching up one eye and the example I gave is just one but for instance if um uh you know someone injures you know gives a scratch on their cornea and they close they patch the eye and the person happens to be 10 years old is it important to then patch the other healthy eye after the the um you know the scratched eye is feeling better in other words how critical is it to ensure the balance of information coming into the two eyes even on the order of hours or days yeah your story is uh it has some features of uh you know totally usual how we think about misaligned eyes leading to amblyopia where one eye is weaker patching the strong eye so the weak eye can recover but not necessarily fully regaining depth perception and so that part of it is you know quite stereotypical the part of your story that's atypical is that for most kids um an hour to let alone minutes an hour to even an hour to a day if you were I don't know if you were a young kid and you just really were training up on throwing darts and you were just keeping one eye closed to throw the darts you know really practicing for an hour a day it'd be very unusual for that to trigger this kind of either strabismus misalignment of the eyes let alone amblyopia and the strabismus is what's giving you the double vision because they're misaligned let alone the amblyopia of one eye turning out weaker if I had to guess of course not having you know done your exam before that fateful day in the swimming pool if I had to guess I would guess that you may have had some intermittent business and your brain was already getting kind of hit and and you neither you nor your parents may have even noticed it it could be happening you know at other times a day or you're not kind of really paying attention it doesn't kind of stand out in the way that that that day that you got out of the swimming pool you really noticed it and it may not have been that strong it may have been quite intermittent but if you had had some years of intermittent isotropia or turning in of the eyes or exotropia turning out of the eyes that just happened here and there but was accumulating sort of uh damage or failure to connect over years leading up to that day in the swimming pool and that day just tipped you over the edge and you've got double vision you really noticed it that led to an eye exam and an eye care provider and they said wait a second this size stronger this size weaker you've got a little amblyopia we're going to start patching your strong eyes so you can get your weak eye back so for 99.9 percent of the kids who like you know yeah they get a little corneal scratch or they're patching one eye closed or or uh you know anything that's sort of a rare event like that nothing to worry about parents don't have to worry kids can be kids they can play they can do that kind of thing and uh and not have to worry and and it's unfortunate that we can't tell in advance which kid's been having the intermittent amblyopia because we don't do a standard eye exam on every five-year-old who's not complaining of anything but but yeah so that's a that's an unusual case in yours and if I had to guess I I would bet that you were having some sort of subclinical untracked Uncharted unnoticed maybe strabismus leading up to that point okay great thank you you can send me a bill at the end um along those lines "

            "text": "I'm 47 years old so I was part of the generation that grew up with some computers in the classroom but not a lot nowadays kids from a very young age are looking at iPads and phones and screens and things very close up and there is a wealth of experimental animal data showing that if you limit Vision to just close range that the eyeball lengthens and therefore the visual image Falls in front of and not directly onto the neural retina the essentially the light sensing portion of the of the eye and those animals become myopic or nearsighted what can we say about the environmental conditions in which kids are seeing from the time they're born through let's say adolescents and their teen years in terms of how their visual system wires up and are there any recommendations that are coming from the scientific literature clinical studies clinical trials excuse me or otherwise that indicate what a healthy visual environment consists of yeah yeah that's a great question and actually it's really relevant these days because uh you know myopia is so common uh it's more common um an Asian populations you know it's called an epidemic in China in California we have a lot of Asian Heritage or Asian Americans and so we see a lot like at Stanford we see a lot of um you know myopia in kids on adults and really starting to get thoughtful on the science of myopia control how do we how do we provide the right environments now what's interesting is that for decades the Assumption some of the data really led us to the path of thinking like gosh the more you spend near activities and these are Mouse model experiments like you described but also well-designed human cohort studies you know figuring out like asking you know kids and families like how long is your kid reading or in front of the computer how myopic are they how nearsighted are they versus how much time is your kid in front of the computer doing near work how myopic or nearsighted are they and these well-designed cohort studies did Point tour words this concept that if you do too much near work as a kid that you're more likely to develop nearsightedness as you get through those those sort of you know uh pre-teen and even into the teen years which is when most of that myopia progression or eyeball elongation is actually happening to cause nearsightedness it's only been in the last few years that some really exciting Studies have actually pointed in a slightly different direction and that's that maybe it's not all not to say it's not about near activity but maybe it's not all about near activity maybe it's actually a little more about the kind of light we're getting into our eyes and I think you've talked about this before and it's really important when they've now studied and asked the kids instead of just how much near and how much far are you doing how much time are you spending indoors in indoor lighting which doesn't have full spectrum light in a typical indoor environment versus how much time are you spending Outdoors playing in the yard you could be reading outside but what are you just what kind of time are you spending outside and and of course when you're outside in sunlight even it's in direct sunlight you're getting a different spectrum of kind of Full Spectrum Lighting from the sun and it looks like it's pretty clear now actually that it has maybe more to do with outdoor lighting time than just near work and so I think that you know we we've we've actually already seen the first couple randomized controlled trials where they're having kids intentionally spending time Outdoors versus sort of Standard Life which you know is going to be often much more indoor time and uh and seeing some effects you follow those kids over a couple of years and the kids who spend time Outdoors are are progressing in their nearsightedness less like they're they're nearsighted prescription is not getting as strong as the kid kids who are spending more time indoors and there's some pretty good biology that's getting worked out going back to animal models more about about how that might be working in the retina in this inside the eye but it's pretty compelling uh concept and and so you know as a parent uh you you may want to be you may want to be telling your kid like okay yeah I want you to read that book or you know if your kids plan on the phone or something like that or the iPad or something like that they're allowed that time okay you can have that time but I want you to spend some of the time that you're doing that Outdoors are there any thresholds for the amount of time that one would suggest their child be outdoors to get that full spectrum light it's a great question you know we talk about cohort studies where we just ask people what are they doing and there seems to be you know a little bit of what we would call a dose dependent response maybe the more time Outdoors might be better we don't know if there's an upper limit like gosh if you go over two or three hours there's no additional benefit talk about that cohort studies the real gold standard for answering these kinds of questions are randomized controlled trials and specifically placebo-controlled or or a control group that's not getting the intervention that's our highest level of evidence for clinical evidence for for any of this kind of science when we're talking about humans or pre-clinical models in the laboratory and the study that hasn't been done yet to really answer that question is to randomize kids to telling this group of kids you just do your normal life tell this group of kids we want you outside an hour this group of kids we want you outside two hours a day this group occurred three hours a day and see between the groups is there a big difference like we have pretty good evidence now from the studies that have been done that the difference between zero and one or two hours is clearly There is five minutes enough is five hours better I don't think we know the answers to those questions yet like what's the "

it's probably not a great idea to be exposed to extremely bright light and this is why people who weld wear eye Shields but of course most people are not welding um what other sorts of environmental conditions are detrimental to our vision health across the lifespan including brightness of light we talked a little bit about near far obviously we want to keep toxins and acids and solvents and things out of the eye but what do you see I'm not because hopefully not commonly but what are some of the things that you feel might not be discussed enough in terms of Eye Health yeah you know I think at all ages eye safety is something that we don't talk about enough um you know our eyes are delicate the front surface of the eye the cornea the Clear Window that lets the light go into your eye that's a delicate very sensitive structure it's thin maybe a millimeter at the thickest a half millimeter in the center of our eye uh the retina is it it's neural tissue this is like really an outgrowth of the brain this is very sensitive it's subject to degenerative disease and injury our eyes even if they just get hit can get very inflamed our eyes can be more inflammatory than a bruise on our skin on our shoulder might be so eye safety is a big one and people who are working in certain industries um you know anyone who's doing any metal grinding people who are even just gardening you know and if you're if you're doing some significant gardening and cutting and you could you know Fleck a little bit of dirt you know there's a lot of there's a lot of for example fungus that lives in the ground natural stuff it's all very normal in the in the Earth but you know our eyes aren't really made to absorb that fungus and and have have a piece of dirt kind of stick in our eye like that and so people are at risk I think for you know for not and we see too much kind of really unnecessary eye injury eye trauma that if people wore either their glasses because they happen to wear prescription glasses or goggles or for more advanced work you know safety goggles of course um if you're sanding doing wood shop projects anything like that sawing including you know again in the garden cutting things um you know I think I think eye safety you know eye trauma is a big one and you know we probably see one or two um what we call open Globes a week come into the Opera into the emergency room and um you know those are tough because you know again the eyes delicate and it can do a lot of healing but but not infinite right and so we really you know that's that's one that I think is really an untapped opportunity is just a little more education around um around eye protection protecting against eye trauma what about eye cleanliness there's some pretty dramatic videos also I've put some of these on my Instagram handle of these are MRIs of people rubbing their eyeballs and people really getting a sense of first of all a restatement of what you said getting a real sense of just how much the eyes are an outgrowth of the brain because of the op when you see with the optic nerves and all their beauty and the eyeballs moving around as someone rubs their eyes I have to imagine that rubbing your eyeballs a little bit isn't bad but I actually called you I don't know if you remember when I was a junior Professor I woke up from a nap one day and I couldn't see out of one eye I was freaking out so of course I called you and I had pressure blinded Myself by falling asleep on my hand or something like that and you assured me that my vision would come back and indeed it did so you play dual role of ophthalmologist and psychiatrist thank you and indeed I can see out both eyes um now um but rubbing our eyes getting gunk in our eyes you know I think unless somebody has lost their Vision temporarily it's hard to imagine this is like a big deal but when it happens it is truly frightening we're so dependent on Vision so um you know what are your recommendations about rubbing or not rubbing eyeballs about um hand washing and cleanliness and also how do you wash an eye properly yeah do you use soap and flush it with water or do you just flush it with water or should you not even do that should use saline I didn't realize these might sound like low level questions but these are the things that people deal with on an all too frequent basis yeah you know for most people most of the time actually the eyes are a very good clean environment and actually are tears are are contain enzymes that help break down bacteria and bacterial toxins and so for most people regular eye washing doesn't have to be any part of their standard routine in terms of the surface of the eye the part of your eye the conjunctiva uh over the whites of the eyes underneath the eyelids anything underneath the eyelids it's pretty self-cleaning and actually our tear production and blinking is very good at keeping our eyes clean the eyelids eyelashes can be another story and especially as we age uh we can you know like our skin is breaking down a little differently than when we were younger you can develop what we sort of nicknamed scurf which is like kind of little dead skin bits that accumulate around the eyelashes a lot of people develop what we call blepharitis which is just just means inflammation of the eyelashes yeah and for that doing some eye scrubs is a good idea they actually sell little pads that you can buy kind of little that you rip open and you can use to kind of lightly clean the eyelashes but you can also just use like a No More Tears baby shampoo just pump a little bit into the palm of your hand once or twice a day let a little uh dilute it with a little water and under the sink and either with your finger or an edge of a washcloth just very lightly rub the eyelashes what I like to do with the eyes closed with the eyes closed and don't scrunch them closed too tight because you're actually burying the eyelashes when you do the roots of the eyelashes when you really scrunch so just gently close your eyes just you know real gentle closure and then just lightly scrub it shouldn't be abrasive you're not trying to exfoliate the eyelids or eyelashes in any way just lightly rub with that kind of dilute No More Tears baby shampoo and that can really help people with their eye Comfort if you feel like you've got something in your eye your ideal eye wash is actually going to be a sterile Salient solution a saltwater solution that you know they sell little bottles over the counter eye wash Solutions like that a lot of people wear contacts will have that kind of eye wash solution just a sterile saline eye wash just pure salt water doesn't have to have any other chemicals or preservatives in it you can of course use not actual uh seawater or salt water not salt water thank you yeah not salt water out of your salt pool not salt water out of the ocean but like a saline salt water that's available in a sterile now you can also just use artificial teardrops and some of those common non-preservatives some of those come preserved versions those are all also completely safe in the to use in the eye and there you can you know you can sort of Spritz into your eye you know hold the lid open and give it a little Spritz if you feel like you've got something in your eye a piece of dirt or A Lash that's not coming out just to rinse it but but having like a regular routine you know you're not going to hurt anything with the occasional eye rubbing we all do these things just kind of as a you know even a nervous habit or just absent-mindedly you know you might you know scratch your arm or rub your eyes or things like that that's fine you're not going to hurt anything there are conditions where people sort of develop kind of a almost like a psychological habit there are certain conditions where people actually do too much eye rubbing it can be dangerous if you're in that group but for the regular run-of-the-mill every day occasional I rubbing fine if you certainly if you get a lash in there and you're trying to rub it and blink it and tear it out and again in that situation you can use some artificial tears wedding drops saline drops those would be the way to do it what an incredible tissue the way you describe it you know the self-cleaning and yet so delicate a piece of the brain literally lining the back of each of our eyes like like a pie crust I mean it's a really remarkable um biological system of course I don't have to tell you that it's just it it never ceases to to amaze me let's talk about eye exams in adults "

            "text": "so people are aware presumably that they're optometrists and ophthalmologists I think it's important that we Define their different and also overlapping roles and for those that you know are past High School age probably not getting eye exams unless they're sensing a problem perhaps not even with blurry vision or difficulty seeing at a distance but sometimes just what feels like fatigue of the eyes or a hard time maintaining alignment of the eyes um so how often do you recommend people get eye exams what is a true regular eye exam and is it important that people go to an ophthalmologist or will an optometrist suffice typically optometrists are a little bit easier for most people to access because there's usually one someplace near an eyeglass store so what are their roles how often should we get our eyes checked yeah um optometrists and ophthalmologists do have very overlapping roles in being Eye Care Providers there are something over 40 or 50 000 optometrists in the United States or somewhere around 20 000 ophthalmologists in the United States optometrists get an optometry degree they often have OD after their name ophthalmologists usually went you know went to medical school so they either have an MD after their name or they kind of a do version of a medical degree and uh and then optometrists will have done additional clinical training in that area in their area of Eye Care provision ophthalmologist MD doctor ophthalmologist Eye Care providers in addition to that training will have done surgical training in Ophthalmology um now there's a lot of overlap and um in both scenarios uh you can be getting your sort of General exam taken care of maybe a screening exam I think that there's been a traditional differentiation between optometrists and ophthalmologists with optometrists providing a little more of the primary care eye screening maybe managing early disease common diseases as well with more advanced disease often sort of upgrading to perhaps specialist ophthalmologists in those areas but that distinction has been declining over time it's still true that in I think most if not all states only the MD ophthalmologists surgeons can do eye surgeries but both both groups of eye care providers can diagnose both can prescribe appropriate eye drop treatments including prescription eye drop treatments for for many of our diseases eye diseases and um and in some states optometrists have successfully lobbied for uh sort of expanded rights of providing Air Care Eye Care and again um access to care for you know the regular person wherever they may live is is the most important element and so being able to access eye care whether it's with an optometrist in your community or an ophthalmologist that may be in your community or maybe at a distance I think that's the the really important thing is to access care now kind of like we were talking about with kids uh if you're in your teens 20s maybe even 30s and not having any problem you've got no complaints you can see a distance you can see it near um you know so you can read without classes you can drive without classes um you're not having any eye pains you know pains around the eyes you know redness of the eyes you may never present to an eye care provider through the first four Decades of life and almost all the time it's going to be okay right if you're not symptomatic the chance you've got some terrible lurking disease in there is low but we do wish that we had a little more screening going on because there are some diseases glaucoma for example my specialty the two main risk factors for glaucoma are increasing age and that usually presents you know in most cases actually after age 40 but also increasing eye pressure and if your eye pressure is too high you can't feel that that won't feel funny to you if it sort of slowly is crept up over the years and so from a screening perspective it is good to get some kind of screening exam could be at a public health fair could be that you go into the local optometrist just say hey I've never been checked I'd like to be checked once make sure everything's good could you ask for sorry to interpret could somebody say I'd like my pressures checked as I recall the optometrist they're going to do a puff test so they're going to blast some air get a sense of how how rigid or or soft again using non-clinical non-technical language here the eyeball happens to be um not right now by the way I'm sure there are are several hundreds of thousands of people who are with eyes closed touching the sides of their eyeballs and I'm only half joking please don't do this folks I'm given the conversation we just had about eye cleanliness and eye rubbing but my understanding is that the old fat truly old-fashioned eye pressure exam was you would close your eyes and the ophthalmologist would gently press to see whether or not your eyes were more rigid than last time yeah is that right yeah that's called ballot mint and you can kind of you can you can kind of just take one second if you're listening and press on your eyes just very lightly and you there's a little give of course the eyelids part of that give but but it's not it's not like rock hard and if we press and it feels under the eyelid like gosh something under there is a rock hard then we know something is wrong that is way too high pressure if it's raw card but I'll tell you our ability to differentiate the fine points of eye pressure other than Rock Hard or not rock hard is pretty limited so yeah the optometrist office or the ophthalmologist office office as part of a comprehensive screening exam they'll check the eye pressure they'll look at the surface of your eyes make sure everything's looking healthy there including the eyelids and lashes and they'll look inside the eye and be able to screen for these diseases that way too in addition to checking if you're complaining of any you know blurriness at distance or at near now after age 40 or so a lot of people will present to an "

            "text": "eye care provider because we all get what's called presbyopia and presbyopia just translates to disease a vision of the agent so you know myopia is our word for nearsighted hyperopia is farsighted actually amatropia means normal sighted so I can see it distance without any glasses I'm amitropic but then we all get presbyopia and as we age the lens inside our eye that's helping focus light onto our retina gets stiffer such that our eye muscles are no longer able to relax and reshape that lens and we're not as good as we age at moving our Focus from distance Vision distance Vision by the way is basically anything three feet or further away You're basically viewing light rays coming from Infinity once you're past three feet so three feet or further being able to focus that into 14 inches or 12 inches which might be a normal comfortable reading space for you we lose that ability to flex our lens relax our lens uh refocus our lens from distance to near and most people around age 40 could be a couple years before could be five or ten years later that you notice it but sort of around that time you start needing reading glasses you need a little extra even if you can see fine at distance and don't need prescription glasses for distance you need a booster you need reading glasses for near I don't know if you're experiencing this yet and yeah I'm really intrigued by this but maybe you could clarify when you say reading glasses do you mean just a magnifier because I use a you know a 0.5 or a 0.75 magnifier for reading but I try and rely on them as little as possible and I want to get to this about using glasses as a crutch and the problems with that I have a story about that too you know it's no coincidence I decided to work on Vision I mean after all um I had a bunch of vision issues that fortunately are corrected but you know I I do experience for instance when I wake up in the morning if I look at my phone which by the way folks I try and get outside and see sunlight first before ever looking at the phone but I'll notice when I first look at my phone in the morning that I can see it very clearly through my right eye but that if I cover my right eye my left eye is extremely blurry to the point where I'm like oh I'm calling Jeff you know I'm I'm afraid but then over the course of maybe 10-15 minutes it resolves and I don't think it's because something's in my eye I don't think it's pressure of having slept on that side I don't think it's a lubrication of the eye issue um but the two eyes seem to come into Focus so to speak um at different rates early in the day and if I pop my readers on I can see right away so I will use readers late in the day often um if I want to read at night or something that's right just it feels so much more relaxing I feel like like I can finally relax whereas otherwise I realize that I'm straining in order to see does is there any um clinical clinical data and what I just described yeah you know Andy I'll tell you my story that's like that and um we were living down in San Diego when you and I were both professors at UC San Diego and uh we had moved into a house and I found a pair of glasses a pair of reading glasses uh in a closet and you know we asked around you know did any of the grandparents uh leave some glasses behind nobody seemed to know who they were so we finally just decided like well I guess the people who moved out of the house just left a pair of glasses you know in this in the back of this closet and then I tried the glasses on and I looked at my phone up close and was just like oh my God wait a second I didn't realize how blurry my near Vision was and this is back I was about 40 42 something like that so so I didn't even realize until I put on the readers and these were you know 1.25 magnifiers you know so awesome yeah and I'll tell you I got addicted because who doesn't like good Vision right right I mean oh my God now I can make the type smaller on my phone I can you know it was wonderful and you can relax a bit I mean the musculature that's responsible for for moving the lens and focusing the eye and then all this extraocular musculature and we forgot I mean I'm definitely going crow's feet um around my eyes uh probably because I you know squint or something but you know just the ability to relax one's face it just feels like you know more more energy I feel like can be devoted to what we're actually looking at yeah we're not making light of this yeah well pretty soon I just kept that one pair of glasses with me all the time and I would just keep them in a pocket and whip them out whenever I was you know working at near using my phone at a little greater distance like a typical computer distance I could still see the computer fine so it really started for like kind of that close-up phone it was it was I could get into here but not all the way into here and um yeah and then pretty soon I was just totally addicted and so you know then I had to go buy 10 pairs and leave them one by the bedside table you know one in the car one in the computer bag one on everything I work at yeah because I'd leave them anywhere and forget them yeah exactly you know yeah so um yeah so whether using the readers accelerates the progression of dependence on the readers is still uh not you know that's still up for debate you know some studies say maybe yeah some studies say maybe no but certainly psychologically we get addicted to good easy vision and if you don't have to squint and if you're not straining your muscles and all of a sudden the text on your phone looks crisper again uh boy that's addictive you're gonna like good vision and so it feels like you're getting dependent and how much of that is changing the eye muscles and how much of that is just the psychology of wanting to have good Vision I think probably the jury's a little bit out on that point but point being you're either either way your dependence will grow and as you continue to age 40s 50s up until about 60 65. the ability to shape that lens gets weaker and weaker and weaker and so you need to move from the 0.5 to the 1.0 to the 1.5s and to the coke bottle to the code well thankfully not you eventually max out at about plus 2.5 or plus three because that's the amount of extra refractive power that you need in magnifiers to take the equivalent of your Infinity viewing and bring it up to 14 inches to read it near basically you need a plus three and then you don't need any lens eye muscle action whatsoever so you kind of max out around 2.5S or threes so because most people will hit this somewhere in their 40s this sort of like gosh I'm having trouble on the phone I think most people actually use that that's like kind of the first time for a lot of people they're like well I guess I should go to the eye office right see the optometrist or maybe ophthalmologist and when they go in they should be getting the standard in either of those offices will be to give you a full screening exam including maybe it's the puff test or a blue light test or a little pen that can check your eye pressure and having a look inside and seeing if you're retina optic nerve look healthy it's kind of screening for all the main diseases and so and they'll tell you at that point hey you look great if you feel like your glasses aren't doing it for you in a year or three years come back or they might say hey I've detected something I'm worried about you and they'll set up a routine for your ongoing Eye Care assuming that

            "text": "presents an enormous strain on my visual system and I've noticed this for a number of years are there any I know there's something called stationary night blindness I don't think I'm stationary night blind um I think the mutation for stationary night blindness was identified in the Colusa horse or something like that these were horses that you could walk up to very easily and they wouldn't even see you until you're right there someone's going to correct me on this it's the internet but I think that the mutation was identified um Etc but I don't think I'm stationary night blind but I do find that driving at night I get very fatigued and then I'll sometimes even wear my plus one readers when I drive at night which removes the fatigue even though I'm looking more or less at a distance are there some conditions that make it hard for people to see at night for which they would want corrective lenses um and what what sorts of biology underlies that assuming that somebody is not stationary night blind or a Colusa I think is the name of the breed horse yeah that's a great question you know we for the for the optical defects in our eyes most or many of which can be corrected with just having the right prescription lenses we can get away with it without using those Corrections in brighter light and so during the daytime um you know you could be slightly blurry you know if I have a real bright light uh and a good high contrast book you know with black letters on the white page I can get away with reading that without my readers unlike if if I'm in dim light then I feel and that might be kind of what you're describing if you're reading at night you actually prefer to use the readers a little more even at night because we can make up for a lot of that blur if we just have bright enough signal and contrast coming into our eyes makes sense yeah so when you're driving at night and noticing this this might be revealing a little bit of a need for glasses now I'm not suggesting this is the answer but far more common than having congenital stationary night blindness would be being what's called a latent hyper rope okay now we talked about already how the lens inside our eye goes from focusing it distance to then we squeeze the muscles the lens actually rounds up and allows us to focus it near some people's Optical system of their eye is actually wired or designed or sort of set up in length not for regular distance which would be anywhere from about three feet to Infinity but it's actually designed it's actually tuned for being beyond Infinity which doesn't make any actual sense when you talk about it but just the Optics of the eye at their best Focus are actually focusing the light behind the retina and and if you're doing that when you're younger you're actually using some of your focusing power to to use those muscles strain those muscles relax that lens round up that lens and have your vision Focus From Beyond Infinity to normal distance like distance vision and so if you're a latent hyperope you are constantly using those muscles and again if you're tired it's the end of the day your muscles are feeling a little fatigued uh your latent hyperopia or by the way if you've had a drink or two alcohol can do this too your latent hyperopia can kind of kick in especially as we're age and we're not as good at refocusing that lens anyway and now all of a sudden your vision is kind of reverting to its natural state which is slightly out of focus at distance because it's actually focused beyond Infinity if you will and so all of a sudden you put on that plus one just for a little extra booster kick and you're like oh yeah yeah distance vision is clean and easy now so I'll have to bring you into the clinic to really be sure but you could be exhibiting a little bit of that kind of latent hyperopia I definitely want the eye exam and I want it from you and I've been called a lot of things in life um and we can now let add

            "text": "discussion is not designed to be an eye exam for me but I have yet another experience that I think illustrates the key importance of both critical period plasticity and the questions about whether or not to rely on corrective lenses and that is from the time I was pretty young I could make my sister laugh by deviating one eye inward so not crossing my eyes but moving one eye Inward and then what happened was when I was in college and studying a lot a lot and getting very fatigued I noticed that this I started just kind of drifting a little bit so I went to the campus Health Center and they gave me a prescription for a prism lens which of course redirects the image but then I noticed that this eyeball moving Inward and I guess for those of you watching on uh on YouTube and not just listening um I can do this um by just moving one eye in all right as I can move this side yeah it's a fairly pronounced it started to really drift in at a relaxation State and I started seeing double again so I thought whoa these prism this one prism lens is a crutch of the sort that I really don't want crushed the glasses it broke them and it never went back to them um I have voluntary control over it but that's one example where the corrective lens can actually create a pretty significant shift in eye position if one relies on it so this gets back to this issue of um when should people Force themselves to work with their natural vision maybe do some more far viewing um as opposed and certainly get outside and get sunlight into the sunlight full spectrum light as opposed to relying on active lenses yeah and and you've raised a very important distinction here and that's the distinction between the muscles that are inside our eye that we use to relax and refocus the lens and the muscles that are on the outside of the eyeball of course inside our orbit but on the outside of the eyeball that turn the eyes and if everything's working right keeps our eyes really yoked straight and we talked about earlier uh this possibility that you may have been having a little bit of intermittent esotropia or intermittent turning in of the eyes that then culminated on that day of a day at the pool when you really noticed it and your ongoing ability to actually turn one eye in could be related to that I remember as a kid standing in front of the mirror and I I couldn't get my eyes to cross even though friends could do it and you know so you know I I was in the losing group on that on that end you became an ophthalmologist and then I became an ophthalmologist and I must say it is very reassuring that you have excellent Vision you know I always worry when I go to a new dentist and then I look up at them in one moment and if they're not wearing a mask that their teeth are not you know pristine I think well what am I doing here so at you know an ophthalmologist with excellent Vision brings me uh great comfort the toddler's children should have shoes right exactly um but yeah so so when to correct when not to correct with lenses and I realize here we haven't talked at all about contacts we've been talking about eyeglasses yeah let's come to contacts in a sec if you want but yeah let me return to your question the difference between providing corrective lenses that allow you to focus for near or distance uh in your glasses so that you can go easy on the inside the eye eye muscle having to work so hard a lot of people get eye strain and sort of uh headaches even from that from not having adequate correction that they're wearing that's different actually especially when we're children or again into that maybe even into the teens and even young adult years from the eye muscles on the outside of the eyes which are supposed to be yoking our eyes straight and so that you have them both looking at the same point in space and and there it's actually quite a common treatment to try to under correct and ask people to exercise and not just give a prism that says hey if your eyes in sometime we'll use a prism so the light sort of looks right to you but rather under correct that and sort of really force you to exercise trying to yoke your two eyes straight together and so that's that's in contrast and they're actually I think many optometrists who often specialize in in what are the right glasses to give in a situation like that wherever possible especially during uh development as our bodies are developing as we're sort of growing in our younger years uh take the approach of intentionally trying to under correct not use a prism or not use a full prism correction uh and um to really help uh sometimes it's also like an accommodative reflex that your eyes are just you're spending so much time reading it near when you read it near your eyes actually naturally turn in a little bit to focus uh at that nearer so that they can be looking at the same word on the page and that can also if you've got kind of too much muscle drive you can overshoot that and so sometimes just using not a prism but like a little bit of a plus lens in kids just so they don't have to work quite so hard to turn their eyes in and sort of over exercise those muscles these are all great examples we're going to an eye care provider often for these kinds of issues an optometrist is the right first place to start you'd like to say that every optometrist and every ophthalmologist is always going to give the exact right thing for for each kid or young adult or older adult to do and and we wish all medical care providers were were always right on Target and a lot of times it's a perfect science but a lot of times it's an imperfect science and so it could be that at least with you know we're now 20 25 30 years later but like it could be that today that 20 year old version of yourself would have been given a different uh approach to having one eye intermittently occasionally turning in like that is there any real value to um near far exercises

sorts of things that anyone can just do I mean whenever possible we like to share tools for various aspects of Health on this podcast but of course we don't want people cowboying this stuff in a way that could be detrimental to their to their Vision so is it okay to get on YouTube and find a smooth Pursuit um Tool uh we can put a link to these there there are several of them um and people spend a few minutes doing this yeah you're definitely not going to hurt anything so totally fine to do it and some people may notice you know like they feel a little more visually active if they do these kinds of exercises um I think most people would do them and not notice something in their daily life we actually have um made so much progress you know in research in thinking about how do we take the diseased or dysfunctioning or aging eye and get it back to healthy and normal but there's a whole other area of science that's we're really just barely touching we've actually we've actually just opened a vision performance center to really get at not just how do we rehab the sick eye back to health but what's the difference between functioning normally and functioning above normally for example athletes when they get studied for visual Vision characteristics they have faster visual reflexes higher visual Acuity uh how much of that was you know genetic how much of that is trained we don't really understand could we train all of us with you know normal vision to get up to Supra normal vision these are like great important questions that are really relevant to you know every regular person of course you know people doing Esports and the gaming communities and athletes is part of what we're studying in the vision performance center but these are really really big opportunities to try to understand how do we move people from normal vision to Super normal vision and there's evidence that you can do it so here's a great example some athletes train using these special goggles that actually use electrical signals in the glasses part of the goggles to actually black out your vision one thirtieth of every second two thirtieths of every second three thirtieths of every second now imagine you and I are passing a basketball back and forth except you're wearing goggles and all of a sudden you're only getting 90 percent of the data of where's that basketball on its way to my hands now you're only getting eighty percent now you're only getting 70 percent of that visual information and you are practicing right you are getting good at catching a basketball when you only have a fraction of the visual information and now I put you back on the basketball court without the goggles you might be really good at passing that basketball around and catching that basketball right and so the idea that we could train and understand the biology of training to get the eyes from normal to supernormal Performance I think it's an amazing area and one that we've really just started to dig into that's fantastic so this is a a new program at Stanford through the department of Ophthalmology is it linked up at all with the woosai performance Institute yeah actually there's been a lot of focus over the years I think in human performance and there's actually a new human performance uh Alliance and Center we've we've we've long had really run through the department of our Orthopedics a human performance laboratory that's really you know much more about joints and muscles and strength and conditioning and stretching to layer on to that now a real understanding of how vision is operating you know it's interesting let's go back to the example of concussion you know we've got I don't know about 800 Varsity student athletes and all the different sports at Stanford and you might have a student athlete come in and say you know something doesn't feel right I got a little hit on the head I feel like my vision is a little bit messed up maybe I've got a mild concussion you could imagine doing some of these tests on some of these performance athletes for example and saying well gosh you look normal but actually they used to be operating at a supernormal rate and this is a noticeable decrement for them and so just starting to study and understand what's the difference between normal and supernormal how do we go back and forth between those two how do we measure that difference and maybe ultimately how do we train into that difference I think it's going to be exciting and not just for athletes you know for for regular people you know you talk about driving at night is there a solution where we could train our eyes to be better at driving at night and I don't know maybe reduce the number of accidents that happen out in the world so well certainly there's um physical training protocols which are redefining what a 60 year old or 70 year old could look like and feel like and be able to perform like why not do the same for vision um so I don't think there's anything Supernatural or greedy about doing it I think that's the excitement of biology and neuroplasticity that you can extend it forward as opposed to just trying to wire up correctly during development this is a perfect time for me to ask you a question that I'd love a clear answer "

            "text": "talk about Lasik that we talk a little bit about contact lenses is there any detriment to having a piece of glass or a piece of plastic on the front of your eye all the time and the reason I ask is not because I think we should live necessarily exactly like our ancestors but it's a pretty bizarre adaptation to put a lens directly onto the front of the eye you have to imagine that the cells and tissues there are accustomed to getting a certain amount of oxygen they're accustomed to get a certain amount of interaction with the environment and and you also are now adding another surface the way that the tears are going to interact with the um you know with the cornea of the eye are probably changed and who knows maybe it doesn't make any negative difference at all but you know putting a contact lens on the front of the eye is you know about as close to putting a device on your brain as I can think of except for maybe the cochlear uh implant yeah yeah that's a great question now first of all um I want to distinguish uh there are a few really medical uses for different kinds of contact lenses like scleral contact lenses for people of certain diseases there are other kinds but I think what we really want to talk about right now is just kind of the run-of-the-mill I want to get my prescription taken care of but instead of wearing glasses I'm going to wear contacts contacts even the newest generation contacts yes they sort of uh change the tier Dynamics on the surface of your eye they um they decrease the oxygen you know diffusion that's just sort of out in the air onto the surface of our eye onto the cells that are on the surface of our eye but most of us especially as we're younger have enough tear film Reserve enough oxygen Reserve that we can easily tolerate these polymer gel soft contact lenses and and wear them happily the advantage of contact lenses over glasses purely from the perspective of correcting your vision is that there's different elements of of of of of the shape of your eye that need to be corrected if you need corrective lenses and so for example if you're for the basketball shape of your eye is a little too steep or a little too shallow that's what the standard glasses correct you may have been told that you have something called astigmatism that's where instead of having a basketball shaped eye you have a slightly football shaped die it's not round in the same dimensions on both axes and again glasses can correct that but then there's higher order aberrations in our corneas in the clear window in the front of our eyes or or to some degree in the lens inside the eye that are that are focusing the light that the glasses prescription can't correct but if you have a nice smooth contact lens on the front it can correct so a lot of people who wear glasses and contacts will report that they have a much higher quality of vision with their contact lens correction than with their glasses correction and again in service of enjoying the best Vision that you can enjoy in your daily life that's an upside to seeing if contacts could work Frio now there's another element though and that's like gosh is there a risk of contact lenses and especially as we age um we have less tear film reserves so contacts may become less tolerable as we age and the other thing is being really good about the cleaning because you know the contacts can trap bacteria or fungus and if you get a corneal infection from a contact lens it actually can be quite devastating to your cornea even if you successfully treat the infection you can be left with some corneal scarring thankfully this happens very rarely but when it does happen it can be quite difficult on you know on the person thereafter to sort of suffer through having maybe a scar from that infection on the surface of their cornea that they that leads to some blurring vision for example so we always recommend that if you're going to wear contacts that you'd be really attentive to whether you're tolerating them well and then also to be really attentive to the recommended use and cleaning of the contact lenses I actually recommend that even though they're a little more expensive to afford that people should almost always be just using the daily contact lenses that they don't have to clean or use for you know two weeks or four week period so these are disposable contacts highly disposable and I hate to think of you know I don't know filling our oceans or what have you with uh more more more polymer plastic but at least the contact lenses are small and it's much safer for your eye to use a daily disposable than to use a two week or a four week and be responsible for the cleaning the other thing to be really responsible about is sleeping in them overnight because overnight when your eyelids are closed of course now you're getting even less oxygen to the surface of your eye actually most bacteria especially many of the Infectious bacteria to our bodies and to the surface of our eye are actually bacteria that Don don't really like oxygen and so we've got a low risk of getting bacterial infections on the surface of our eye but if we use contacts too much don't clean them or sleep in them overnight when our eyelids are closed and now there's even less oxygen kind of helping keep the surface more more clean if you will that increases the risk a lot so being really good with the recommended use and cleaning of the contacts is critical considering daily use contacts you don't have to and look most contacts are going to be the two week or four-week kind where you put them in the cleaning solution overnight each time give them a good rinse and put them back in the next day and again most people 99.99 some percent of people are going to do just fine with that follow the instructions and never get into trouble as we age they're going to become less tolerable people are going to say I used to wear my contacts for 12 hours now my eyes feel really dry after six or eight or ten hours maybe some years after that they say gosh I could barely use it for four hours I only use them when I go out on a Saturday night uh and and that's okay you can you can you can back off as you need to back off but in the meantime if it helps you especially in the younger decades if it helps you really enjoy uh Your Best Vision great what about UV protection in eyeglass "

            "text": "lenses and or contacts I've dealt with many questions about blue light I am not somebody who believes that all blue light is terrible I think it's important to avoid Bright Lights of any wavelength late at night if you want your melatonin production to be normal and you want to sleep well it doesn't matter if you're wearing blue blockers or not if you're just under blastingly Bright Lights it's going to suppress your melatonin and yet some people enjoy blue blockers for that reason nowadays A lot of people wear blue blocker glasses or blue blocking lenses or contacts throughout the entire day thinking that blue light is bad for our eyes during the day I happen to subscribe to the idea that we want as much bright light as we safely can tolerate during the day ideally from sunlight in order to set our circadian rhythm and yet a lot of eyeglasses and a lot of contact lenses out there have UV a and or UVB blocking features to them so what are your thoughts on this and I'm perfectly happy to be wrong and revise my my stance on this um yeah what what do you think about this UV a B blocking yeah it's a good it's it's a it's really important to distinguish that UV light on the light spectrum is right next to blue light red lights on the other end and of course infrared is beyond that and our eyes other animals can see these but our eyes can't see infrared that's why we call it Beyond red and we can't see ultraviolet we call it Beyond violet UV light is right next to Blue Light UV light is known to have a lot of adverse effects it's not really good for our skin and therefore you know we really want to avoid Sunburn and kind of UV data you know exposure and damage on our skin similarly it's not really good on our eyes and it affects both the ocular surface a little bit in terms of like kind of how dry or irritable your eyes might feel for some people and certainly over the long term UV light will accelerate the formation of cataract which is a blurring of an oxidative blurring of the lens inside the eye profound UV light can be damaging to the retina if you're getting way too much on the inside so uh so blocking UV light I believe is just absolutely standard in every pair of eyeglasses and I don't know actually how much to what degree the different kinds of contact lenses also filter at least UV light now blue blockers blue blocking glasses is totally different and as I say like I think almost all glasses because the Plastics almost all glasses are not made of glass anymore they're made of plastics but I think almost all of them now filter the UV light which again is like probably the safe move for our eyes and periocular environment around the eye environment so blue blockers you know that's been a huge fan I'll tell you the last three years through the pandemic everybody getting on their computer hours in front of Zoom meetings where we used to walk from building to building for a meeting things like that um I you know I I remember you know like this sort of big uptick in these kinds of questions and I'm not sure that there's any data that blocking blue is helpful in any way and as you say it may actually play into sort of circadian entrainment of our natural daily Rhythm so so I think blocking UV is a good idea and I think it's pretty standard you know they make glasses is by the way that actually react to UV light they're called transitions there may be a few different brands I don't know uh but but you know these are the sunglasses that are clear except then they turn dark if you're out in the sunlight and it's not just any sunlight it's actually the UV wavelengths that that cause the chemical reaction in the glasses to turn from from Clear see-through to to sunglass blocked glasses and um you may notice if you if any of you out there are using these kinds of glasses uh that they don't work in the car you'll wear them in the car and they won't go to sunglasses even though it's sunny out and again that's because all standard car glass also filters UV that's why if you're riding around in the car and it's sunny out you've got your hand you know up next to the window uh wearing a t-shirt you never get a sunburn through the car window anymore because all our car glasses also filtering UV light for us so so that's a very informative answer and before we started recording you and I were discussing this practice of morning sunlight viewing which again I highly recommend over and over and you pointed out that low solar angle sunlight so sunlight low in the sky viewed for maybe 10 minutes a morning and again not forcing oneself to look at it and stare but blinking as needed is not going to cause extensive UV damage to the eyes it's really the when the sun is directly overhead that we're getting a lot of UV which raises this other question which is for people that don't wear corrective lenses and therefore are not blocking UV light to the eyes um what should they do are they in trouble should they be wearing a brimmed hat brimmed Hat's a great idea that I've got a rid of a lot of the direct light into the eye of course you still have reflected light off of surfaces and that that can include UV light of course um you know wearing sunglasses outside even if you don't have corrective lenses you know it's may also be more comfortable to wear sunglasses outside um so so these are all fine you know at the end of the day it's probably not making a huge difference in the health of your eye whether you've spent the last 50 years wearing sunglasses really dogmatically for your outdoor time or not you know if you were going to develop let's just say age-related cataracts inside your eyes which we'll all get if we all live to 120 we all get cataracts you know it's going to happen some people younger some people older maybe if you were really dogmatic about wearing your UV blocking sunglasses maybe you'd get your your cataracts at 75 years old instead of 72 years old it may not be a huge difference in that regard so again not something to be super stressed I think it's I think it's more a question of just what are you comfortable in uh and then certainly I will say the the other advantage of a wide brim hat is it's keeping sun off of your face and these are the you know some of the especially the upturned portions of your face like the cheeks and the nose these are the some of the most common places to get some of the skin cancers that you can get over a lifetime of sunlight exposure so you know the wide brain app is it's helping you for that as well can't help but ask about comfort "

            "text": "should I get Lasik eye surgery does it does everyone need Lasik can it help every can it make us you know suprophysiological you know can it make me a 2010. you know often it can I'll just say that you know right up front it is amazing people will come out of Lasik surgery uh better than 2020 but uh the cornea we talked about before that's the Clear Window on the front of your eye all the light has to get through there and we talked about before already like if your cornea is misshapen if the basketball shape of it is too too shallow or too steep then you're going to need glasses to see a distance and also at near if it's to football instead of basketball then it's going to be what we call astigmatism and uh and then you can't you need a correction for that instead of correcting with glasses that sort of help shape the light so it can go through your slightly off-shaped cornea instead of wearing contact lenses which also shape the light just as it's entering your cornea right on the surface of the eye you can just reshape the cornea and the way Lasik does that there's a few different versions of Lasik but basically the way the Lasik does that is it actually ablates or uh gets rid of a little ring or rim of that corneal tissue so that for example if you were a little shallow and you got rid of a little bit of that tissue around the edge with the laser the Lasik you know starts with the word laser if you got rid of that edge tissue then you're sort of making it a little more basketball shaped right or if you were too steep on your cornea and you used the laser to kind of shave off a little bit of the the tip of that basketball right then you're flattening it out flattening out the cornea so it's that kind of reshaping and the technology has come so far that the Lasik procedures can actually correct not just the regular aberrations that we talked about but also some of these higher order aberrations and there are different monikers for this kind of Lasik it's all I think become fairly standard but wave front guided where it's actually using light waves to measure with a very exact localization exactly how much and where to laser for each individual eye to make that cornea pass the light as ideally as possible now one or a few percent of patients will actually have a dry eye problem so after a Lasik because so it does interfere a little bit with those corneal nerves for example and I and I do think that if you're a person who already has dry eye hopefully if you're asking your eye surgeon about Lasik hopefully you're being counseled that if you have dry eye this might not be a good idea for you just like contacts might not be a good idea for you if you already have a lot of dry eye but for a lot of people especially a lot of younger people it's quite common I I think the statistics suggests maybe 15 or 20 percent of people who would benefit from LASIK you know who who would who would otherwise be wearing glasses may get Lasik at some point in their life and um you know I used to joke you know Lasik it costs more money than a pair of glasses but it doesn't cost more money than 10 pairs of prescription glasses over the course of a decade or two you know and so I used to joke that gosh if uh if everyone had to have laser eye surgery for their best vision and someone came along and said hey I've got an invention you don't have to have laser eye surgery anymore it rests on the ears and the bridge of your nose I call them glasses could they have sold those for a thousand two thousand dollars a pair I don't know maybe but you know there's kind of a cultural element of saying you know like I don't want to wear glasses you know I'd love to be able to walk around without relying on glasses or contacts of course people are very athletic or spending a lot of their time doing Athletics they may be quite irritated to have to deal with glasses or contacts people who have very severe prescriptions I mean if you wake up and you can't even really you know you're fumbling for your glasses on the bedside table because you have such a strong strong prescription you can't even see what it says on the alarm clock next to the bed you know these are all groups of patients who like really change their daily lives by getting out of glasses or contacts and taking advantage of Lasik and in I don't know 99 of the time it's going to be like a safe comfortable outcome for the patient do they do Lasik on kids um there are certain conditions uh unusual cordial conditions where procedures like Lasik get used but I believe uh it's ideal to not do it on children uh or even even young teenagers and the reason goes back to what we were talking about before you are much more likely to change the shape of your eye and therefore the prescription you need and therefore what exactly the Lasik would laser while you're still in those growing years and you really want to be able to say hey my eyeglasses prescription has not changed in the last two or three or five years because if you do Lasik and then your eye keeps changing shape then by the next year all of a sudden the lasik's not doing you're backing glasses again right you can do a touch-up Lasik do a little bit more but it's generally you know you're going to be a happier person if you've reached that point in your life and maybe that's maybe that's your late teens more commonly it's into the 20s where your eye has stopped changing its prescription every year you've been steady and stable for some years and now you do the Lasik and it could easily last you a decade you mentioned dry eye "

            "text": "get a lot of questions about dry eye and a few years ago I think you and I were at a meeting and someone who is very woven in with the companies that build and test drugs for different aspects of vision health said you know what the field really needs is a treatment that works for dry eye and I thought dry eye like of all things like why dry and then the more I learned about it I realized that there are millions and millions of people that really suffer from dry eye and for whom standard drops are just not working so what underlies dry eye is it some deficiency in the lacquer hormone glands that produce tears for the eye and and I think of Tears as just kind of salty water and I wonder if they are more than that is there an oil in there and if we know what's in tears why can't somebody just manufacture something that works as well as tears yeah you know it turns out you know we we've got a lot of other eye diseases but by far the most common eye disease and and I've been told by far the most common eye treatment you know purchased by anyone now granted it's almost always over the counter things like artificial tears is for dry eye and uh in part that's because as we age our tier quantity goes down and our tier quality goes down and so what do those do mean we have two different major elements to tiers and as you alluded to one is the salt water porn of part of the tears and those are made primarily by the lacrimal gland and there's a steady drip of those tears onto the ocular surface as well as reflexive tearing right if you get an eyelash in your eye or or you cry your lacrimal ground will actually squeeze out extra salt water tears uh onto the surface of the eye and so so that's that's where most of the sort of wet part is coming from but there's also essential oils critical oils these come from other types of glands including glands in our eyelids called meibomian glands and the oils form a surface over the salt water part of the tear film and and also intermix into the tears and as we age we go down in the quantity of both salt water part of our tears and oil part of our tears but also the quality and in particular the oil parts uh can often be seen to be going down more quickly the the eye drop industry has pretty much solved for replacing the salt water part of your tears right you can get either bottles of preserve preservative containing you know you could use that bottle all month or for a month or two or you can buy these strips of preservative free artificial tears which are really basically like the salt water components and you can use those preservative free ones we have patients using them every hour if they need to right you're not going to hurt anything with preservative free artificial tears you just drop them in just drop them in yeah either I as as often as you want or need when you feel it it's exacerbated in the world we live in uh especially these days now with more time on computer it turns out that when you read including when we maybe used to read more books than we do now but also read on the computer or stare at the computer screen or work on the computer or actually just even watch the TV I've done very careful studies you blink less when you're doing any of those activities and when you blink glass you're redistributing the tears less effectively and you're squeezing out less of the tears including less of the oils as effectively as you could be when you're blinking and so um so between aging tier quality tier quantity a lot of our activities we're kind of in this losing proposition now now I mentioned that uh we're pretty good at replacing the wet salty part of our tears but actually as an industry we haven't really figured out a how to really effectively replace the oily part and the oils do a few things including when you have a layer of oil on top of a layer of water the water is less likely to evaporate and so the oils help hold the tears on the surface of your eye and so if we're not making as many or as good oils as part of our tear film that's uh that's also like kind of working against the salt water part of our tears um so yeah as an industry as a community uh that we haven't really figured out how to get the oil part solved for either by effectively replacing the oils or treating our eyelids in a way kind of rejuvenating those oil glands getting them to kind of go back to their youthful State again you know so that the eyes including the eyelids and the oil glands unfortunately they're aging just like the rest of our body so so this is this this is one of the major features uh is uh is dry eye and and uh and it's tough on patients because you feel it it's really tough because you feel it yeah I have yet another experience to report where when I had the blepharitis which fortunately was transient I also experienced it every time I would blink I could feel the blink and boy I'll tell you I we all most of us take for granted uh what a pleasure it is to not observe the blinking of our eyes because for those I think in last about two weeks every time I blink I'd feel an almost sandpaper like experience it wasn't particularly painful but it was very uncomfortable because it suddenly conscious of every blink and it's very very distracting now that resolved when the blepharitis resolved but I can't even imagine what it would be like to deal with that all day long every day yeah really Dreadful yes it really is and it and so you're absolutely right it's a very it's one of our really big unmet needs and and although for most people with dry eye it can be managed with just the regular over-the-counter artificial teardrops you can buy at the grocery store or over the counter at the pharmacy for a subset of people who have really much more severe symptoms with the dry eye it's it's really it's hard it's a really hard thing to have to live with all the time and and we Counsel on the use of Tears we Council on the use of eyelid cleaning like we talked about before where you take either these eyelid scrubs or a little dilute baby shampoo to keep those eyelashes really clean that keeps those oil glands functioning at their top capacity for you uh so that you're maximizing you know high quality cheer production reducing inflammation is also important whether that's inflammation "

            "text": "from allergy and of course a lot of people's dry eye gets much worse in the spring with seasonal allergies when pollen is around if you have dust allergies in your home uh that worsens your symptomatic dry eye or other forms of inflammation there's a there's an element of dry eye that we actually think is inflammation kind of working against our tear glands and and in fact some of the prescription drops now to help combat more severe dry eye uh are anti-inflammatory or even low-dose steroid types of eye drops um so I think these are all uh sort of Next Generation treatments I think at the at the really Leading Edge of Next Generation treatment is trying to better understand the nerves on the cornea and ocular surface and if there are ways that we could better treat them and help help regenerate and rejuvenate kind of how the nerves and the and the tissue cells are interacting underneath that tear film and that's where for some patients we can actually use either for example blood serum your blood serum is actually very rich in growth factors and many of those growth factors it turns out empirically are really helpful for people with dry eye so if you're one of those people who's been really struggling with with dry eye you might ask your eye care provider hey I heard about serum tears is that something that could help me serum tears because this PRP is this platelet-rich plasma related but but not the plate platelet-rich portion at least not yet they can draw your blood spin out all the cells you're left with the kind of liquid part of your blood that's the serum and then they can dilute that with some salt water maybe with some preservatives in some cases yeah you could keep it in your freezer thaw a bottle when you're ready to use it you know each few weeks and and then use it just like an eyedropper bottle and those serum tears uh actually can be very helpful for people with with much more advanced or severe hard to control dry eye symptoms uh companies are really trying to figure out hey what are the most important parts of the the serum can we just identify and package just the growth factor and uh and turn that into a product for dry eye patients and so there's a lot of research on the ocular surface and dry eye uh going into um going into that space right now I'll tell you the one other recommendation that I always give patients there's a fair amount of evidence that if you're getting too much of some of these preservative chemicals which of course if you're going to use an eye drop bottle for a month it should have a preservative in it right so that you know open the bottle and then it grows bacteria a couple weeks later and now you're you're you know you're using contaminated eye drops so for bottles it's typical to have preservatives but I really recommend for patients if they're using anything more than a couple drops here and there for their dry eye control to actually go for one of the preservative free artificial tears they come in lots of Brands I'm sure the house brands at any of the pharmacies use them too I make them too and these are the ones that come in like strips plastic strips and you break one off you break off the little cap you can use as much as you want all day you have to throw that one out if you have anything left over you have to throw it out at the end of the night and the next day break off a new one because there's no preservatives and once you open it you don't want bacteria to grow in that salt water right but it's really good because the preservatives can be very irritating or even inflammatory to the ocular surface to the surface of our eyes so we really do want to if we're using more than a drop or two upgrade that cost a little bit more money if they're still over the counter upgrade yourself to the preservative free artificial tears those are great recommendations I'm also really interested in this serum thing uh because you know we're this discussion taking place 10 years ago and I raise PRP platelet-rich plasma there would probably be a lot of eye rolls no pun intended because I think myself and a lot of other people in the let's call the sort of standard scientific and medical community looked at platelet-rich plasma right alongside stem cell therapies because they were cheek to jowl back then as you recall before the FDA regulations about stem cell claims which we will get to um of course PRP was suggested as a source of stem cells it turns out there are very few if any true stem cells in PRP and yet now as I understand it PRP is an FDA approved protocol for injection into the uterus injection into pretty much every tissue and organ system of the body in order to quote unquote rejuvenate it and here I'm not promoting PRP and yet it is a very common practice now in more standard medical clinics but it started off kind of Niche even gray Market kind of underground it's diverged from stem cell therapies and we're going to talk about major modes of vision loss in a moment and this horrible situation that happened down in Florida of a clinic injecting stem cells into patients eyes to recover vision and it actually blinded them so we'll talk about stem cell therapies but for the record is PRP something that's now standard in major optimal ophthalmic clinics excuse me including your department at Stanford are you drawing out blood spinning it down taking plasma taking serum and re-injecting it or reapplying it to patients eyes not not yet in Ophthalmology uh in eye clinics I I would say we're sort of like right now on the edge of uh groups are starting to study that is it safe is it valuable is it any better for certain conditions like on the ocular surface than serum Tears For example this sort of diluting a patient's own own blood serum uh so so it's being studied it's a very active area now it turns out that this PRP plasma has uh you know again like a high concentration nation of growth factors that's probably what's responsible for a lot of the kind of quote tissue Rejuvenation effects uh be that be they as they may but but it's being studied but it's definitely not a standard of care yet uh at least in in Ophthalmology space and and you know I think whenever there's something really new it really deserves to be properly studied we talked before about you know at first you're going to do trials where you just test it carefully in a few people maybe a few of the most severely effective affected patients be really thoughtful about uh you know the ethics of trying out for safety then as you develop a little understanding of the safety you really want to eventually get to properly controlled randomized what people in the community often call double blind trials but we in Ophthalmology like to call Double masked trials blind is a bad word trials yeah yeah so you really want properly controlled trials testing is it really working thing is it really deserve the claims that people are making and that has not yet really come to fruition at that level for Ophthalmology or Eye Care yet so we've been talking a lot about normal visual "

glaucoma things like retinitis Pigmentosa macular degeneration the things that if we could we would all avoid and yet are out there in the world at pretty high rates you know I'm sure you'll share with us what those rates are and as bad as these things are there are ways to detect and offset their progression so that people don't necessarily lose their Vision so if you could could you share with us what are the major forms of vision loss in childhood and in adulthood and what can each and all of us do in order to find out if we have one of these conditions and therefore treat it effectively yeah that's great you know let's start by just reminding ourselves what are the major causes of vision loss and these are going to differ where you are in the world but the major the number one cause of low vision is actually refractive error people who need glasses and especially in other countries affordability access can't even get glasses okay so that's just refractive error but that's fundamentally correctable the next most common cause of vision loss is cataract cataract is the blurring the Aging of the lens inside the eye behind the cornea we talked about how that is responsible for focusing light under the back of the eye it also has to be clear enough that the light gets through the lens and a cataract is a normal aging process you know as I said if we all live to 100 or 110 years old we'll all get cataracts we'll all need cataract surgery we actually is you know in in the eye clinic we see cataracts years or even decades before they're affecting your vision in a meaningful way so that the cataracts are forming and that's okay but at some point they get bad enough that it's time to take them out we've actually solved for cataract surgery pretty efficiently we could do a four to eight minute surgery maybe if we're taking our time it's 10 or 12 minutes of surgical time take out a cataract it works beautifully 99 point something percent of the time we put a plastic a clear plastic lens inside the eye exactly where your lens used to be and there's even lenses that can Flex or focus light from far and near so cataracts is fundamentally a there's still room for improvement but there's it's fundamentally a solved problem the problem is is that worldwide there aren't enough cataract surgeons there's not access to care the Machinery or the lenses cost too much money in developing countries to get out to the number of people who would need them so it's actually just again an access to care cataract is a reversible treatable easily treatable problem but it's number two on the list of causes of vision loss in the world because we don't have enough access to care we need a lot more sort of programming around Global Ophthalmology Global Eye Care to solve for cataract just to bring that solution to countries around the world then after that you start hitting the eye diseases that lead to what are currently irreversible non-reversible causes of vision loss the number one cause of irreversible vision loss in the world is glaucoma so what is glaucoma glaucoma is actually probably a little cluster or constellation of diseases that we lump together it's a degenerative disease like a neurodegeneration we talk about neurodegenerations in the brain like Alzheimer's and Parkinson's glaucoma is a neurodegenerative disease it happens instead of affecting one or different area in your brain it happens to affect the optic nerve that connects the eye to the brain and we need our optic nerves to carry all the visual information from the eye to the brain and so if your optic nerve is degenerating in glaucoma and I should add there are other optic neuropathies so-called diseases of optic nerve degeneration for example you can get a stroke of the optic nerve you can have an inflammatory disease like multiple sclerosis called optic neuritis that affects the optic nerve so you can get other optic nerve diseases but glaucoma is by far the most common optic neuropathy and the problem is is just like you know just like spinal cord injury which is also part of the central nervous system right the brain the spinal cord the rat and the optic nerve that's the central nervous system and there's no regeneration and that's why spinal cord injury leads to permanent paralysis well optic nerve injury or optic nerve degeneration unfortunately leads to permanent vision loss so in the case of glaucoma how do we get ahead of that glaucoma has two major risk factors one is increasing age there are actually infantile and pediatric glaucomas unfortunately and those can be much more aggressive much more damaging when they present so early in kids uh in babies and in children most of the kind of run-of-the-mill glaucoma usually results presents in adulthood and even in in the Aging adults so much more common after 50 or 60 or 70 years old increasing the other main risk factor for glaucoma is increasing eye pressure the eye actually you know it stays inflated it's a balloon it has to stay inflated we need some amount of eye pressure to keep our eye as a as an inflated balloon but if the eye pressure goes too high and we talked about this before you won't even feel it if it slowly gets too high if the eye pressure goes too high that causes glaucoma and um and that's one of the things that we talked about you really include in a comprehensive eye exam when you're just getting a screening checkup at your eye care provider at your optometrist or ophthalmologist office they're going to check your pressure and just as a screening tool check to make sure it's not too high we can treat glaucoma today by trying to reduce the impact of that high pressure by lowering the eye pressure so we have treatments for glaucoma that Target the eye pressure we have medications like eye drops we have lasers that can be used inside the eye that can also lower the eye pressure and ultimately if we need them we also have surgeries that can also provide an outflow that lets the fluid out of the eye in a controlled way so that the eye pressure can be brought back down into normal ranges again the reason that glaucoma ends up being the number one cause of irreversible blindness in the world is number one we can't get those therapies everywhere in the world the affordability of eye drops the access to lasers or surgical procedures Around The World Isn't equal to what it is here and even within our country you know people may not be accessing Health Care effectively to get screened for glaucoma or to get treated for glaucoma the other big problem with glaucoma is that it affects our peripheral vision first and only very late in the disease does it pinch in and finally pinch off the center of our vision in typical glaucomas and that's a real problem because we don't notice if our peripheral vision is down you know our peripheral vision isn't that good to begin with and if you're driving and you can see a pedestrian step off the sidewalk you think your peripheral vision is fine but actually your peripheral vision could already start being damaged by glaucoma and you won't notice it in regular daily life and that's where the importance of screening and early detection really comes in for glaucoma what we don't have for glaucoma we can come back to like kind of what's The Cutting Edge of the future in these eye diseases what we don't have are treatments that really Target the optic nerve degenerative process and we can come back and talk about that so that's glaucoma and optic neuropathies then the next two major causes of currently largely irreversible "

            "text": "related to pressure although there is pressure normal glaucoma glaucoma is a death of the retinal ganglion cells the neurons that connect the eye to the brain and once they are gone at least at this point in human history they can't be replaced although hopefully because of work that you've done in the other Laboratories are doing at some point that statement I just made will not be true in the rgcs can be replaced meanwhile what can and should people do to find out if they have glaucoma and to treat glaucoma and is it true that even if somebody has normal pressure that lowering their eye pressure further protects them against glaucoma yeah that's absolutely right so most important is to get screened with a formal exam at your optometrist or ophthalmologist because you you won't notice you won't have any symptoms if your eye pressure is too high you won't know you're not likely to notice until very late in the disease if your peripheral vision is being damaged through the course of glaucoma so most important us have a screening exam a good comprehensive screening exam will always include checking the eye pressures and also looking in the back of your eye the head of the optic nerve where all the fibers leave the eye and carry the optic nerve information back to the brain we can see that when we look inside your eye and uh and and glaucoma has a fairly characteristic look to it in the optic nerve head so so looking at the optic nerve had uh we have Imaging and peripheral vision testing that can also be included in those screening exams so if you really get a comprehensive screening exam you can very reliably detect if you have glaucoma to worry about or you're in the clear if you have glaucoma to worry about we have treatments and you're absolutely right whether you start with a abnormally high pressure or you start with a pressure that's on the face of it in the normal range in either case lowering the pressure has been shown in large properly controlled clinical trials to slow the progression of optic nerve damage and vision loss so absolutely in either case starting with high pressure or starting with normal pressure in either case you've got to lower the pressure further and as I mentioned we have eye drops those are usually the first line there's very good data that there's a very benign non-invasive laser it's not the same kind of laser that gets used for Lasik but there's a benign very safe type of laser called selective laser trabeculoplasty SLT we call it and that's also very effective as a first line actually in the largest clinical trial from which the data have been coming out just even over the last few years it's called the light trial in the light trial patients with glaucoma were randomly assigned to either get the laser or the sort of most common first strongest eye drop and uh that gets used clinically and actually on many features they both worked at least as well but when looking out over the long term actually the laser had some advantages over the eye drop not in the least of which by the way it's very nice for patients to not have to like remember to use the eye drop every night and so um so that's quite helpful I think uh to to keep in mind as a treatment option uh early in the course of the disease of course if the eye drops under our lasers are not enough early in the disease we also have surgical approaches to lower the eye pressure further you know even with all of our treatments all of these treatments stepping patients through all of this about 10 15 even 20 percent of patients will lose very meaningful functional vision and maybe five ten fifteen percent of patients especially depending where you are in the world will go blind from glaucoma including in you know quote-unquote developed countries uh there's still a very significant cohort of patients that go blind legally blind and then you know absolute blindness I can't even tell if the lights are on in the room uh so it's it's it's it's devastating it's Insidious it's hard to detect early um and so glaucoma's still a tough one even with all of the treatments that we have okay so get your pressures checked folks and if you are prescribed drops take your drops I hear about patients not taking their drops which to me just seems like baffling but I guess having to do something day in and day out is it can be Troublesome enough that unless people are losing their Vision very quickly or they are very afraid of losing their Vision sometimes they just neglect to take them it's hard it's hard for glaucoma eye drops it's hard for taking your blood pressure medication it's hard for a lot of medicines you know if you're if you're taking a medicine where you don't feel better you know if you have a headache and you take an aspirin or Tylenol or an ibuprofen uh you know you feel better you feel reinforced gosh taking that pill made sense right but if you're using an eye drop that like hey this is going to protect you for the next 20 years from losing your vision but you don't notice every day that anything's better and by the way the eye drops could be a little irritating maybe it stings a little for a minute or two and you put it in your eye some people are even less tolerant of the eye drops it's hard to feel motivated every day and we know that we call that compliance we know that it's very hard for patients to stay compliant with prescribed medications where they don't feel or notice a difference in a daily way I realize that we can't stop aging "

people strive to drink less and smoke less including vaping nicotine less if they are concerned about glaucoma yeah and not just glaucoma macular degeneration actually macular degeneration has a couple major risk factors macular degeneration aging just like with glaucoma major risk factor smoking including exposure to secondhand smoke major risk factor for macular degeneration and for the progression and vision loss potentially associated with macular degeneration in the case of macular degeneration there's also a couple of genes that we've sequenced the human genome and there's a couple of genes associated with magnet generation two that's less true for your typical run-of-the-mill adult Kuma there are genes for the Pediatric and infantile forms of glaucoma uh so yeah smoking a hundred percent including vaping uh it's a No-No for your eyes just like it's a No-No for the rest of your body and uh it's tough as the eye doctor to have these conversations with patients because you kind of feel like well you know they must know it already and I'm trying to be the good guy in the room with the patient convince them to use their other medications but it's it's important for us also as Eye Care Providers to reinforce the message with our patients a smoking terrible idea uh for maca degeneration also for glaucoma you know glaucoma is interesting because the optic nerve where it degenerates kind of right at the head of the optic nerve where it exits the eye it's what we call a watershed Zone it's kind of an edge of two blood vessel supplies and if either of those blood vessels supplies are a little bit short on blood or oxygen supply to that optic nerve head your glaucoma is going to get worse your optic nerve is going to be under fed and that's going to worsen this degenerative process just by not having all the right nutrients and oxygen so the other thing is that especially for glaucoma everything that we talk about for being heart healthy for the rest of our body is is almost certainly true for glaucoma and so I also always counsel glaucoma patients it's not just no smoking but eat healthy have a multivitamin uh get some exercise all those things that are good for your cardiovascular system are going to be good for your eyes in general and in particular if you have glaucoma or at risk high risk for glaucoma I realize that smoking or vaping are problematic for glaucoma and for macular degeneration but we can't have a conversation about glaucoma without at least mentioning cannabis I did an entire episode about cannabis which touched on some of the real dangers of very high THC concentration cannabis this lost me a few um followers I'm sure no problem because what was important was to convey the fact that the Cannabis that's out there nowadays comes in a variety of different strains and ratios of THC to CBD there's some severe risks of high THC especially in young males although not always the point being that there are and I want to be very clear about this because for whatever reason cannabis gets people really up in arms they always say it's not as bad as alcohol but guess what we did an entire episode about alcohol and there the message is very clear zero is better than any and two a week is probably the limit and if you're an alcoholic zero is the rule so with cannabis it's clear by my read of the data that it can lower eye pressure which may undermine the progression of glaucoma somewhat but if people are smoking that cannabis is it therefore going to offset any gain that one would get from that cannabis and then how does one account for the potentially problematic aspects of very high THC cannabis yeah it's a great question and the truth is is that in most patients cannabis will lower the eye pressure the problem is is it really only lowers that eye pressure During the period that you're high from the Cannabis and the second problem is that smoking version of getting that cannabis into your system the smoking is bad for your lungs by the way the smoke from Cannabis or from cigarettes is also terrible for your dry eyes it causes inflammation it dries out your eyes so it's also very bad from that perspective now so the the problem with cannabis is not that it doesn't work to lower the price we want to lower the pressure that's great the problem with cannabis is that it's not realistic for most of our patients to prescribe could you go out and be high from Cannabis 24 hours a day seven days a week for the next 20 years I'm sure some people have tried and succeeded um but right that's not practical for most people and certainly for young people it could be really especially problematic yeah I should say absolutely so so I recommend not taking that approach but that said I I'm definitely not a decryer of it and now that there are edible forms I certainly have patients who are using it in a responsible way uh especially edible forms and uh and in select cases like that could make the difference for them helping to keep the pressure down and I'll say for example you know it turns out you've talked a lot over the last couple years about diurnal curves and circadian rhythms it turns out that our eye pressure also undergoes a circadian rhythm and it's actually highest at night while we're sleeping kind of peaks in those early morning hours then hits a low throughout the early day and then kind of rises again throughout the afternoon into the evening and we have a lot of patients who they come into their Clinic visit their eye pressure looks normal but it's actually quite a bit higher when they're at home and that could explain some fraction of what we call normal pressure glaucoma it just looks normal during the day it's actually high at night and so in particular some patients I certainly have some patients who are using these products like let's say before bed and if it's controlling their eye pressure at night while they're asleep when the eye pressure would have been the highest it may confer some protective advantage over time but that said again like for most patients it's not going to be the primary approach I'm most excited about the idea of you know Laboratories or companies figuring out which the compounds Within These cannabinoids they're called within these products are actually responsible for lowering the eye pressure and could we get like a more potent eye specific long-acting drug that's basically derived from the concept of cannabis but works better and is more compatible with not bringing along all the other adverse elements that can come with cannabis use you mentioned the Circadian rhythm and "

            "text": "eye pressure and the fact that eye pressure is higher at night is there any advantage to sleeping in a particular position I know this might sound a little detailed but I seem to recall an abstract or a paper a few years ago at a meeting that you and I both attended were that said that if people slept with their head below their feet eye pressures were higher than if their head was slightly elevated above their feet and for somebody who has glaucoma this could make a pretty substantial difference in terms of their eye pressures at precisely the hours of the night we should say in which they could be doing the most damage to the ganglion cells yeah absolutely and we will sometimes counsel patients with severe glaucoma especially if they're you know poorly responsive to standard therapies or poorly able to tolerate standard therapies we'll counsel them if they're able to sleep up on a couple pillows get kind of a 30 degree sleep angle going what I don't want to do is interfere with a person's sleep because I just I fundamentally feel for the total health of the whole human being getting a good night's sleep is maybe more important than that 30 degrees and if trying to sleep up on pillows at 30 degrees it's going to lead to kind of restless difficult sleep night I'd rather the patient get a good night's sleep but if they can tolerate it and especially if they have a sort of a tough version of glaucoma then we'll we'll let them try see if they can sleep up the other really interesting question that arises is uh does which side you sleep on affect uh which I might have worse glaucoma glaucoma is almost always with with a few rare exceptions almost always a disease of two eyes but it can present very asymmetrically in fact it's quite common to have one eye kind of have worse damage than the other and and we don't know fundamentally why that is but one hypothesis was gosh maybe if you sleep on the right eye uh then your right eye will have worse glaucoma because the pressure is a little higher down below or maybe it's pressing on the pillow in a way or some something like that there have been a couple studies really really looking at that question a couple Studies have said the lower aisle have worse glaucoma a couple Studies have said the higher I will have worse glaucoma so the upshot is it probably doesn't matter which side you sleep on we also know when you video people in their normal sleep pattern even if you feel you always fall asleep on the left side of your face people toss and turn all night probably over the course of the night you're spending a similar amount of time on each eye I'm glad you brought up that point in terms of macular degeneration I'm curious about "

            "text": "the things that people can do as opposed to the don'ts in order to perhaps offset macular degeneration one of the things that I'm intrigued by are the results of Glenn Jeffery's laboratory over at University College London I had known Jeff for probably a decade or more and he typically worked on animal models but then a few years ago started publishing studies I believe there are now two published studies showing how red light exposure and near infrared light exposure done early in the day to the eye at a distance of about two feet for just a couple of minutes a few times a week could offset some of the vision loss associated with age-related macular degeneration in people older than 40. that's my understanding of these studies and there's a theory there about enhancing function of mitochondria and photoreceptors by reducing reactive oxygen species there's a whole mechanistic hypothesis but my question is is that the sort of protocol that produces significant enough offset of macular degeneration like we should all be looking at red lights in the morning um or is it still too early days in order to really conclude that data is very compelling the data are very compelling that this kind of red or near infrared light therapy can be at some level neuroprotective and yes uh the the data suggests that uh kind of ramping up high high functioning mitochondria is a part of that activating neuroprotective Pathways in the retina it's actually been demonstrated in animal models and a little human data here and there but both for macular degeneration kind of uh degenerative is but also for optic neuropathies you know like glaucoma retinal ganglion cells the cells that carry all that visual information from the eye to the brain they're chock full of mitochondria too and uh and so the idea that this could be a therapeutic approach I think is very compelling there are a number of studies actually I think still ongoing today really trying to figure out what's the right dose how much brightness do you need is there an optimal wavelength how many minutes does it matter when during the day you provide that light or how many minutes or hours um these are still very much open questions you know what's the dose what's the delivery um but it's it's it's it's it's very promising looking and there's biological premise and I'm excited to see where that goes because again that's like a that's a very accessible uh sort of therapeutic approach that could be brought to a very broad swath of of people so I'm excited about that sorry I didn't mean to interrupt and completely non-invasive um I should um probably mention a warning which is if people are going to decide that they're going to jump on this result and do red light exposure in the early part of the day no matter what color a light is if it's too bright you can damage your eye so I think this is why you're pointing the fact that we need established protocol calls before people really start blasting their eyes with red light and if they are going to expose themselves to Red Light it shouldn't be uncomfortably bright do I have that yeah that's absolutely right you know actually uh light effect um we talked about this a little bit earlier um there's actually now data also that red light and actually interestingly studies using light at the other end of the visible spectrum violet light either of those in small daily doses can also be used to prevent progression of nearsightedness in children in school-aged children and so I think we're really just on the cusp of really understanding the biology of how these different light therapies might be leveraged maximally to to maximize our Eye Health and both during development and at the other end of the spectrum as we age so it's an exciting area and I think this kind of phototherapy is uh you know a very hot topic for research right now very hot topic one has to wonder whether or not these light therapies the fact that infrared works and maybe ultraviolet works is are really just capturing some of what sunlight is naturally doing when as you mentioned before a child or perhaps an adult also spends a certain number of hours outdoors I mean maybe we're just filling in the blanks that are neglected nowadays because we're spending so much time indoors under artificial lights and in front of screens yeah yeah very thoughtful possibility yeah I have a couple of we don't have to call "

            "text": "for our vision which presumably stems from some peripheral understanding about the fact that vitamin A is integral to the photosynthesis pathway of converting light into electrical and chemical signals that the rest of the eye brain can use and yet I'm guessing that there probably aren't that many people walking around who are vitamin A deficient they're probably out there but not that many especially in developed countries and in addition in the last really five years but in particular in the last two years I've seen a proliferation of supplements on the market to promote Eye Health and Longevity of vision I'd love your thought on this General theme of nutrition and supplements for improving Eye Health or for maintaining Eye Health and before we started recording you mentioned that Ophthalmology or at least Eye Health is one area of medicine that has a bit not extensive but a bit of a longer history of exploring supplementation in rigorous randomized control trials whereas other areas of Neuroscience and Neural Health such as Alzheimer's Etc certainly there are brain health supplements out there but there aren't a lot of rigorous data to support them just yet so what are your thoughts on nutrition um aside from the standard thing of you know people shouldn't be ingesting too many calories such that they are obese and diabetic and therefore you know Etc indirect effects of nutrition um what are your thoughts on nutrition and supplementation for Eye Health yeah you know you're absolutely right and again in Ophthalmology we actually do have quite a bit of studies there's been quite a bit of attention over the years even over the decades looking at this question and I think it's worth highlighting um a couple of yeses and a couple of no's for macular degeneration which we talked about being an exceedingly common cause of vision loss there have been two age-related eye disease studies called arids age-related eye disease studies era there is arids and then arids too and those studies were a large randomized Trials of using giving giving patients supplements and in arids it was vitamin c and e uh higher dose than would just come in a multivitamin zinc and copper and then also beta-carotene and beta-carotene is one of these what are called carotenoids it's a it's a if you look at the extended family there's maybe 600 different chemical entities of these carotenoids and beta-carotene is one of them that's in the direct pathway of making vitamin A and so that was the principle in the Arid study and the Arid studies showed that patients randomized to these pills compared to controls it it did these are antioxidants in part right in addition to feeding into that vitamin A pathway and um and the patients randomized to get that supplement mixture showed less progression of their dry macular degeneration in the moderate to severe ranges if you had mild macular degeneration they didn't show a statistically significant Improvement but I will say it's my experience you know myself with patients and and seeing how the field works you know if you have mild macular degeneration even though it's not as clinically proven we're still often recommending hey if you can afford that supplement go ahead and buy that now arids Was Then followed by a second study arids too also with vitamin C vitamin E zinc and copper they actually tested whether a slightly lower dose of zinc would be as good as a higher dose and a lower dose was as good as a higher dose and then instead of the beta-carotene they tested against the beta-carotene they tried two other carotenoids that are called lutein and zeaxanthine and and they actually found head to head that the second the arids II formula without the beta-carotene and with the lutein and zeaxanthin that that formula was even better at slowing dry macro degeneration in the moderate to severe population again it's not clear how much it may help mild back the generation but in the uh sort of clinically defined moderate towards severe group there was a statistically significant it reduced it by about 20 25 the progression of your dry Market generation and you know over a couple of years 25 five percent you may not notice but over a couple of decades you know that could really slow down the progression of your disease now it turns out that the beta carotene they noted a little bit of an increased cancer risk in the patients in the arids one who had that beta-carotene mostly in patients who are smokers they also noticed in the second one that if you were already not taking a multivitamin or not eating a diet that's already naturally rich in lutein or zeaxanthin that the effect of that supplement was even stronger so it was very strong clinical trial support for taking what we now use this arids II supplementation and I'm sure we can list the formula or put it in the links under under your podcast uh uh that that thus really does slow macular degeneration so that's like a very strong example of a yes you should do this there's one yes brewing in the glaucoma "

            "text": "topic that we can cover in more detail in a subsequent episode of the podcast because I absolutely want to have you back to discuss this in more detail I'd like to just get your thoughts on the fact that the neural retina is in fact neural and it's part of the brain and we are hearing an increasing amount of positive chatter about the use of Imaging the eye and the retina directly as a way to detect other forms of neurodegeneration for those that are listening or for watching um you know I'm putting my hands up in kind of C shape at the back of your eye is lined with these with this three cell layer thick thing that is the neural retina which are really pieces of brain that connect to the rest of the brain and because it resides in the eyes and outside the cranial Vault people like you skilled clinicians with the appropriate tools can look into the eye and see the brain directly without having to cut through the skull and my understanding is that more and more ophthalmologists are seeing cases where degeneration of the retina is correlated with degeneration of structures deeper in the brain making Imaging of the neural retina perhaps one of the best diagnostic tools for predicting and tracking the progression of Alzheimer's and other forms of neurodegeneration do I have that right yeah absolutely actually this is a super exciting area you know we we have this long-standing sang in Ophthalmology that the eye is a window to the brain the eyes of window to the soul of course is a log standing sang right and and it turns out that you know in Alzheimer's disease as an example you know we really talk a lot about the degeneration of basal forebrain cholinergic neurons that are leading to the cognitive deficits in Alzheimer's disease but it turns out that there is also some degeneration throughout other areas of the brain including the retina and since we have such a relatively easy time Imaging the retina you can go into your doctor's office and get a quick little sort of laser scan of the retina a picture of the ratna compared to like going through a full MRI processor for your brain and we can detect the degeneration of the retina and optic nerve associated with Alzheimer's disease it looks like the same thing is happening in Parkinson's disease in Ms now one of the issues is that in a lot of these degenerative diseases were able to detect the difference in the retina but were not necessarily able to say hey if we see this in the retina it's multiple sclerosis but if we see that in the retina it's Alzheimer's disease so there may not be there may be good sensitivity to detecting the disease and to following whether your diseases your brain disease is getting worse but there may not be very good specificity differentiating the different diseases and I say that with a very big asterisk at the end of that sentence because there's actually amazingly cool new data one of our colleagues who you know Alf dubra has helped revolutionize a new way of Imaging the retina that's giving us now cellular resolution and even subcellular resolution seeing things smaller than the sizes of cells inside our retina and recently in one of his projects he's teamed up with another one of our faculty Heather Moss she's a neuro-ophthalmologist so she really specializes clinically in the eye brain connection and her research focuses on that and together they made actually an amazing recent discovery of very specialized unusual novel structures that they can detect in the retina of patients with multiple sclerosis and whether these kinds of discoveries or other similar kinds of discoveries are going to lead to kind of a a whole new generation of biomarkers which are ways of measuring disease diagnosing who has the disease figuring out who's getting worse from the disease figuring out who's responding to therapies that we're trying to use to treat the diseases this is a very exciting area and this really touches on what we're all hoping is the future of of eye care as well as the rest of medicine and that's that's Precision medicine but also what we call Precision Health we really want to not just figure out what drug treatment to give this patient versus that treatment but we really want to figure out who's at risk of even getting some of these diseases and gosh we could intervene now and prevent them from ever getting in trouble in the future fantastic can't wait to hear more about those developments and listen I want to say on behalf of the listeners and myself just thank you ever so much for the discussion today I don't think I can ever recall a conversation that's included so much basic science and clinical science and also so many actionable recommendations both do's and don'ts as it relates to something so critical as Eye Health I also I was just reflecting for a moment about the fact that I think you and I met 20 years ago when you were a graduate student by the way folks um Jeff is uh sort of the Kobe Bryant of sorts although unfortunately still with us in the sense that he went directly from his MD and phds skipped his postdoc didn't require one directly to being a faculty member most people don't do that they do a five-year postdoc in between wait and then I believe he's going to tell me all the places I'm wrong and I should just come clean that um Jeff is my chair of department at um Stanford School of Medicine Department of Ophthalmology so for me I I see this as a particularly warming but also um at once unpredictable but pure pleasure of an experience to get to learn so much from you because I don't think we've had this long to sit down and talk science in a very long time so thank you for doing that for my own sake thank you for teaching us so much about how to take care of our Eye Health and now you can tell me where my history is wrong maybe my hippocampus is degenerating no it's been a pleasure over the years I have nothing but the warmest memories of of you as a postdoc and me as a graduate student getting to be you know nerds in the laboratory uh 20 years ago 20 years ago at Stanford in the lab of Ben Barris and uh and very warm wonderful feelings about you know learning science and how to do science and making real advances even at that time and then the fact that we've had the chance to cross paths in San Diego again at Stanford collaborate on important projects having to do with you know developing new ways of measuring diseases developing new ways of treating diseases the idea that we're going to actually bring forward some of the advances that our lab that you're a lab that other people's Labs have been making in neuroprotection in diseases like glaucoma and macular degeneration in regeneration of the optic nerve of the retina we're real close on a lot of those this is a major topic of really The Cutting Edge research that we're really trying to keep pushing forward because we know it's so important to patients you know I I often joke you know my mother had a uh a sign outside the bathroom and it said remember how long a minute is depends on what side of the door you're on and I I really appreciate that like as fast as we're trying to go with our research and moving that into clinical research which I think we're doing very effectively in the department really working on Vision restoration research in the department I appreciate that as fast as we think we're going it's not fast enough for so many patients who are suffering from these diseases so thanks very much for having me on it's been a real pleasure reconnecting over these many important topics I really appreciate the chance to talk with you well delighted to do it and looking forward to doing it again you're an amazing colleague friend clinician and now public health educator thank you thank you for joining me for today's "
