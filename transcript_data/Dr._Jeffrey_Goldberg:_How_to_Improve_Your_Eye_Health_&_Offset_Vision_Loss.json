            "text": "second but I want to interrupt you withthis question so you mentioned that umyou know there can be a misalignment ofthe eyes I've seen many people's babieswhere there is one eyeball that seems tobe kind of drifting around and then itmight correct but sometimes they'll havea we don't want to get technical herefor our listeners we'll keep it Generalbut either convergent eyes or one eyeconverging cross eyes or walleyed youknow again using uh that non-technicallanguage hereum and my understanding is that thebrain is taking that information in andit's very plastic it's changing at theseearly stages of development and thatit's fairly critical to get that stuffcorrected early on because if you waittoo long the brain can essentiallybecome blind to the the um or rather thethe brain cannot learn to handle theproper alignment so in other words if akid has cross eyescrossed eyes excuse me and they're notcorrected uh until their 20s it'spossible that they will never recovernormal vision whereas if you recover ifyou align the eyes properly early indevelopment they can indeed recoverVision how early can and should oneconsider getting those eye realignmentsdone yeah yeah pretty much right on whatthey'll do is if they detect any eyemisalignment and sometimes parents areare good at noticing that and sometimesyou take a picture and one eye got thered eye reflex and the other one didn'tand sometimes people notice that theirkids eyes are sort of turning in itseems like too muchum sometimes there's what's calledpseudostrabismus which is where actuallydepending on your Anatomy if you have alittle extra skin sort of on the insidecorners of your eyes it makes your eyeslook turned in when actually they'restraight but if your eyes are actuallyturned in or slightly less common inchildren more common in adultsmisalignment turned outit's really important to correct thatearly and the reason is as you weresaying the brain starts ignoring it itfails to fully develop the straw wrongconnections from the for the data comingin from one of those two eyes into thebrain and if you pass certain sort ofthresholds during development duringchildhood without correcting thatconnectivity getting those two eyes towork together properly you canpermanently lose thatum and so we use sort of we used to usevery sort of uh you know gross numberslike it's fully correctable if you canintervene before age three it's partlycorrectable if you can intervene beforeage six you got a chance before age ninebut it turns out in follow-on studiesthat even kids into their young teenshave a shot at correcting that I brainconnection that amblyopia that that lossof vision uh that that can occur duringearly development so even if you're onlyyou know unfortunately detecting thatlater on in childhood or even sort ofthe tween years or early teen years it'sstill worth a try to really push toum retrain the weaker eye and then alsorealign the muscles so that they canwork together to keep the eyes focusedI'll tell you it's interesting andthere's a lot more to learn about brainplasticity and probably a lot of reallycool newtherapies yet to discover that couldreopen what's called critical periodplasticity this this this plasticitythat we have during development thatkind of goes away as we age and and thatcritical period plasticity as you knowhas been the best studied actually inthe visual system and the idea that wecould reopen that is really fantasticbut for different parts of that ibrainconnection there's different periods forcritical period plasticity for exampleeven if you get the amblyopic eye to seewell again and then you realign the eyesand now they're working together a lotof kids will never recover full depthperception stereopsis the use of twoeyes to see depth for example so whythat part of the brain doesn'tcorrect as well as the visual Acuity orcentral vision part of the brain I'm notsure if we understand that yetI'm going to ask for a curbside consultas sometimes called right now by tellingyou a story when I was a kid I wentswimming without goggles and I had oneeye closed and the other eye open andclosing as it went in and out of thewater because I'm a deficient swimmerand I only breathe to one sideunless I really consciously forcedmyself to breathe to both sides in afreestyle swim got out of the pool and Iwas seeing doubleit was pretty eerie and then it becamedownright scary because I didn't recovermy double vision until they patched oneof the eyes to forcing me to use theother eye that had been closed theentire timeand fortunately this was done earlyenough and it I was young enough thatwithin I think it was about a day or soI restored what normal vision however mydepth perception is terribleum I'm the kid that you know Fly ballwas hit to me in the Outfield and it'scoming it's coming and then it hit methis is why I've generally focused onfoot Sports throughout my entire life asopposed to you know precise hand-eyecoordination I'm better at throwingdarts and things with one eye closedthan I ever would be with both eyesmaybe that's true for most peoplequestion I have isis it true that even just a few hours ofmisalignment of information to the twoeyes early in development canpermanently rewire the brain unlessthere are some corrective measures suchas patching up one eye and the example Igave is just one but for instance if umuh you know someone injures you knowgives a scratch on their cornea and theyclose they patch the eye and the personhappens to be 10 years old is itimportant to then patch the otherhealthy eye after the the um you knowthe scratched eye is feeling better inother words how critical is it to ensurethe balance of information coming intothe two eyes even on the order of hoursor days yeah your story is uh it hassome features of uh you know totallyusual how we think about misaligned eyesleading to amblyopia where one eye isweaker patching the strong eye so theweak eye can recover but not necessarilyfully regaining depth perception and sothat part of it is you know quitestereotypical the part of your storythat's atypical is that for most kidsum an hour to let alone minutes an hourto even an hour to a day if you were Idon't know if you were a young kid andyou just really were training up onthrowing darts and you were just keepingone eye closed to throw the darts youknow really practicing for an hour a dayit'd be very unusual for that to triggerthis kind of either strabismusmisalignment of the eyes let aloneamblyopia and the strabismus is what'sgiving you the double vision becausethey're misaligned let alone theamblyopia of one eye turning out weakerif I had to guess of course not havingyou know done your exam before thatfateful day in the swimming pool if Ihad to guess I would guess that you mayhave had some intermittent business andyour brain was already getting kind ofhitand and you neither you nor your parentsmay have even noticed it it could behappening you know at other times a dayor you're not kind of really payingattention it doesn't kind of stand outin the way that that that day that yougot out of the swimming pool you reallynoticed it and it may not have been thatstrong it may have been quiteintermittent but if you had had someyears of intermittent isotropia orturning in of the eyes or exotropiaturning out of the eyes that justhappened here and there but wasaccumulating sort of uh damage orfailure to connect over years leading upto that day in the swimming pool andthat day just tipped you over the edgeand you've got double vision you reallynoticed it that led to an eye exam andan eye care provider and they said waita second this size stronger this sizeweaker you've got a little amblyopiawe're going to start patching yourstrong eyes so you can get your weak eyeback so for 99.9 percent of the kids wholike you know yeah they get a littlecorneal scratch or they're patching oneeye closed or or uh you know anythingthat's sort of a rare event like thatnothing to worry about parents don'thave to worry kids can be kids they canplay they can do that kind of thing anduh and not have to worry and and it'sunfortunate that we can't tell inadvancewhich kid's been having the intermittentamblyopia because we don't do a standardeye exam on every five-year-old who'snot complaining of anything but but yeahso that's a that's an unusual case inyours and if I had to guess I I wouldbet that you were having some sort ofsubclinical untracked Unchartedunnoticed maybe strabismus leading up tothat point okay great thank you you cansend me a bill at the endumalong those lines"

screens and things very closeup and there is a wealth of experimentalanimal data showing that if you limitVision to just close range that theeyeball lengthens and therefore thevisual image Falls in front of and notdirectly onto the neural retina theessentially the light sensing portion ofthe of the eye and those animals becomemyopic or nearsightedwhat can we say about the environmentalconditions in which kids are seeingfrom the time they're born through let'ssay adolescents and their teen years interms ofhow their visual system wires up and arethere any recommendations that arecoming from the scientific literatureclinical studies clinical trials excuseme or otherwise that indicate what ahealthy visual environment consists ofyeah yeah that's a great question andactually it's really relevant these daysbecause uh you know myopia is so commonuh it's more commonuman Asian populations you know it'scalled an epidemic in China inCalifornia we have a lot of AsianHeritage or Asian Americans and so wesee a lot like at Stanford we see a lotofum you know myopia in kids on adults andreally starting to get thoughtful on thescience of myopia control how do we howdo we provide the right environments nowwhat's interesting is that for decadesthe Assumption some of the data reallyled us to the path of thinking like goshthe more you spend near activities andthese are Mouse model experiments likeyou described but also well-designedhuman cohort studies you know figuringout like asking you know kids andfamilies like how long is your kidreading or in front of the computer howmyopic are they how nearsighted are theyversus how much time is your kid infront of the computer doing near workhow myopic or nearsighted are they andthese well-designed cohort studies didPoint tour words this concept that ifyou do too much near work as a kid thatyou're more likely to developnearsightedness as you get through thosethose sort of you know uh pre-teen andeven into the teen years which is whenmost of that myopia progression oreyeball elongation is actually happeningto cause nearsightednessit's only been in the last few yearsthat some really exciting Studies haveactually pointed in a slightly differentdirectionand that's that maybe it's not all notto say it's not about near activity butmaybe it's not all about near activitymaybe it's actually a little more aboutthe kind of light we're getting into oureyes and I think you've talked aboutthis before and it's really importantwhen they've now studied and asked thekids instead of just how much near andhow much far are you doing how much timeare you spending indoors in indoorlighting which doesn't have fullspectrum light in a typical indoorenvironment versus how much time are youspending Outdoorsplaying in the yard you could be readingoutside but what are you just what kindof time are you spending outside and andof course when you're outside insunlight even it's in direct sunlightyou're getting a different spectrum ofkind of Full Spectrum Lighting from thesun and it looks like it's pretty clearnow actually that it has maybe more todo with outdoor lighting time than justnear work and so I think that you knowwe we've we've actually already seen thefirst couple randomized controlledtrials where they're having kidsintentionally spending time Outdoorsversus sort of Standard Life which youknow is going to be often much moreindoor time and uh and seeing someeffects you follow those kids over acouple of years and the kids who spendtime Outdoors are are progressing intheir nearsightedness less like they'rethey're nearsighted prescription is notgetting as strong as the kid kids whoare spending more time indoors andthere's some pretty good biology that'sgetting worked out going back to animalmodels more about about how that mightbe working in the retina in this insidethe eye but it's pretty compelling uhconcept and and so you know as a parentuh you you may want to be you may wantto be telling your kid like okay yeah Iwant you to read that book or you knowif your kids plan on the phone orsomething like that or the iPad orsomething like that they're allowed thattime okay you can have that time but Iwant you to spend some of the time thatyou're doing that Outdoors are there anythresholds for the amount of time thatone would suggest their child beoutdoors to get that full spectrum lightit's a great question you know we talkabout cohort studies where we just askpeople what are they doing and thereseems to be you know a little bit ofwhat we would call a dose dependentresponse maybe the more time Outdoorsmight be better we don't know if there'san upper limit like gosh if you go overtwo or three hours there's no additionalbenefit talk about that cohort studiesthe real gold standard for answeringthese kinds of questions are randomizedcontrolled trials and specificallyplacebo-controlled or or a control groupthat's not getting the interventionthat's our highest level of evidence forclinical evidence for for any of thiskind of science when we're talking abouthumans or pre-clinical models in thelaboratory and the study that hasn'tbeen done yet to really answer thatquestion is to randomize kids to tellingthis group of kids you just do yournormal life tell this group of kids wewant you outside an hour this group ofkids we want you outside two

youremember when I was a junior Professor Iwoke up from a nap one day and Icouldn't see out of one eye I wasfreaking out so of course I called youand I had pressure blinded Myself byfalling asleep on

nowum butrubbing our eyes getting gunk in oureyes you know I think unless somebodyhas lost their Vision temporarilyit's hard to imagine this is like a bigdeal but when it happens it is trulyfrightening we're so dependent on Visionso um you know what are yourrecommendations about rubbing or notrubbing eyeballs aboutum hand washing and cleanliness and alsohow do you wash an eye properly yeah doyou use soap and flush it with water ordo you just flush it with water orshould you not even do that should usesaline I didn't realize these mightsound like low level questions but theseare the things that people deal with onan all too frequent basis yeah you knowfor most people most of the timeactually the eyes are a very good cleanenvironment and actually are tears areare contain enzymes that help break downbacteria and bacterial toxins and so formost people regular eye washing doesn'thave to be any part of their standardroutine in terms of the surface of theeye the part of your eye the conjunctivauh over the whites of the eyesunderneath the eyelids anythingunderneath the eyelids it's prettyself-cleaning and actually our tearproduction and blinking is very good atkeeping our eyes clean the eyelidseyelashes can be another story andespecially as we age uh we can you knowlike our skin is breaking down a littledifferently than when we were youngeryou can develop what we sort ofnicknamed scurf which is like kind oflittle dead skin bits that accumulatearound the eyelashes a lot of peopledevelop what we call blepharitis whichis just just means inflammation of theeyelashes yeah and for that doing someeye scrubs is a good idea they actuallysell little pads that you can buy kindof little that you rip open and you canuse to kind of lightly clean theeyelashes but you can also just use likea No More Tears baby shampoo just pump alittle bit into the palm of your handonce or twice a day let a little uhdilute it with a little water and underthe sink and either with your finger oran edge of a washcloth just very lightlyrub the eyelashes what I like to do withthe eyes closed with the eyes closed anddon't scrunch them closed too tightbecause you're actually burying theeyelashes when you do the roots of theeyelashes when you really scrunch sojust gently close your eyes just youknow real gentle closure and then justlightly scrub it shouldn't be abrasiveyou're not trying to exfoliate theeyelids or eyelashes in any way justlightly rub with that kind of dilute NoMore Tears baby shampoo and that canreally help people with their eyeComfort if you feel like you've gotsomething in your eye your ideal eyewash is actually going to be a sterileSalient solution a saltwater solutionthat you know they sell little bottlesover the counter eye wash Solutions likethat a lot of people wear contacts willhave that kind of eye wash solution justa sterile saline eye wash just pure saltwater doesn't have to have any otherchemicals or preservatives in it you canof course use not actual uh seawater orsalt water not salt water thank you yeahnot salt water out of your salt pool notsalt water out of the ocean but like asaline salt water that's available in asterile now you can also just useartificial teardrops and some of thosecommon non-preservatives some of thosecome preserved versions those are allalso completely safe in the to use inthe eye and there you can you know youcan sort of Spritz into your eye youknow hold the lid open and give it alittle Spritz if you feel like you'vegot something in your eye a piece ofdirt or A Lash that's not coming outjust to rinse it but but having like aregular routine you know you're notgoing to hurt anything with theoccasional eye rubbing we all do thesethings just kind of as a you know even anervous habit or just absent-mindedlyyou know you might you know scratch yourarm or rub your eyes or things like thatthat's fine you're not going to hurtanything there are conditions wherepeople sort of develop kind of a almostlike a psychological habit there arecertain conditions where people actuallydo too much eye rubbing it can bedangerous if you're in that group butfor the regular run-of-the-mill everyday occasional I rubbing fine if youcertainly if you get a lash in there andyou're trying to rub it and blink it andtear it out and again in that situationyou can use some artificial tearswedding drops saline drops those wouldbe the way to do it what an incredibletissue the way you describe it you knowthe self-cleaning and yet so delicatea piece of the brain literally liningthe back of each of our eyes like like apie crust I mean it's a reallyremarkableum biological system of course I don'thave to tell you that it's just it itnever ceases to to amaze melet's talk

know are past HighSchool age probably not getting eyeexams unless they're sensing a problemperhaps not even with blurry vision ordifficulty seeing at a distance butsometimes just what feels like fatigueof the eyes or a hard time maintainingalignment of the eyesum so how often do you recommend peopleget eye exams what is a true regular eyeexam and is it important that people goto an ophthalmologist or will anoptometrist suffice typicallyoptometrists are a little bit easier formost people to access because there'susually one someplace near an eyeglassstore so what are their roles how oftenshould we get our eyes checked yeahum optometrists and ophthalmologists dohave very overlapping roles in being EyeCare Providers there are something over40 or 50 000 optometrists in the UnitedStates or somewhere around 20 000ophthalmologists in the United Statesoptometrists get an optometry degreethey often have OD after their nameophthalmologists usually went you knowwent to medical school so they eitherhave an MD after their name or they kindof a do version of a medical degree anduh and then optometrists will have doneadditional clinical training in thatarea in their area of Eye Care provisionophthalmologist MD doctorophthalmologist Eye Care providers inaddition to that training will have donesurgical training in Ophthalmologyum now there's a lot of overlap andum in both scenarios uh you can begetting your sort of General exam takencare of maybe a screening exam I thinkthat there's been a traditionaldifferentiation between optometrists andophthalmologists with optometristsproviding a little more of the primarycare eye screening maybe managing earlydisease common diseases as well withmore advanced disease often sort ofupgrading to perhaps specialistophthalmologists in those areas but thatdistinction has been declining over timeit's still true that in I think most ifnot all states only the MDophthalmologists surgeons can do eyesurgeries but both both groups of eyecare providers can diagnose both canprescribe appropriate eye droptreatments including prescription eyedrop treatments for for many of ourdiseases eye diseasesand um and in some statesoptometrists have successfully lobbiedfor uh sort of expanded rights ofproviding Air Care Eye Care and againum access to care for you know theregular person wherever they may live isis the most important element and sobeing able to access eye care whetherit's with an optometrist in yourcommunity or an ophthalmologist that maybe in your community or maybe at adistance I think that's the the reallyimportant thing is to access care nowkind of like we were talking about withkids uh if you're in your teens 20smaybe even 30s and not having anyproblem you've got no complaints you cansee a distance you can see it nearum you know so you can read withoutclasses you can drive without classesum you're not having any eye pains youknow pains around the eyes you knowredness of the eyes you may neverpresent to an eye care provider throughthe first four Decades of lifeand almost all the time it's going to beokay right if you're not symptomatic thechance you've got some terrible lurkingdisease in there is lowbut we do wish that we had a little morescreening going on because there aresome diseases glaucoma for example myspecialty the two main risk factors forglaucoma are increasing age and thatusually presents you know in most casesactually after age 40 but alsoincreasing eye pressure and if your eyepressure is too high you can't feel thatthat won't feel funny to you if it sortof slowly is crept up over the years andso from a screening perspective it isgood to get some kind of screening examcould be at a public health fair couldbe that you go into the localoptometrist just say hey I've never beenchecked I'd like to be checked once makesure everything's good could you ask forsorry to interpret could somebody sayI'd like my pressures checked as Irecall the optometrist they're going todo a puff test so they're going to blastsome air get a sense of how how rigid oror soft again using non-clinicalnon-technical language here the eyeballhappens to beum not right now by the way I'm surethere are are several hundreds ofthousands of people who are with eyesclosed touching the sides of theireyeballs and I'm only half joking pleasedon't do this folks I'm given theconversation we just had about eyecleanliness and eye rubbing but myunderstanding is that the old fat trulyold-fashioned eye pressure exam was youwould close your eyes and theophthalmologist would gently press tosee whether or not your eyes were morerigid than last time yeah is that rightyeah that's called ballot mint and youcan kind of you can you can kind of justtake one second if you're listening andpress on your eyes just very lightly andyou there's a little give of course theeyelids part of that give but but it'snot it's not like rock hard and if wepress and it feels under the eyelid likegosh something under there is a rockhard then we know something is wrongthat is way too high pressure if it'sraw card but I'll tell you our abilityto differentiate the fine points of eyepressure other than Rock Hard or notrock hard is pretty limited so yeah theoptometrist office or theophthalmologist office office as part ofa comprehensive screening exam they'llcheck the eye pressure they'll look atthe surface of your eyes make sureeverything's looking healthy thereincluding the eyelids and lashes andthey'll look inside the eye and be ableto screen for these diseases that waytoo in addition to checking if

way is basicallyanything three feet or further awayYou're basically viewing light rayscoming from Infinity once you're pastthree feet so three feet or furtherbeing able to focus that into 14 inchesor 12 inches which might be a normalcomfortable reading space for youwe lose that ability to flex our lensrelax our lens uh refocus our lens fromdistance to near and most people aroundage 40 could be a couple years beforecould be five or ten years later thatyou notice it but sort of around thattime you start needing reading glassesyou need a little extra even if you cansee fine at distance and don't needprescription glasses for distance youneed a booster you need reading glassesfor near I don't know if you'reexperiencing this yet and yeah I'mreally intrigued by this but maybe youcould clarify when you say readingglasses do you mean just a magnifierbecause I use a you know a 0.5 or a 0.75magnifier for reading but I try and relyon themas little as possible and I want to getto this about using glasses as a crutchand the problems with that I have astory about that too you know it's nocoincidence I decided to work on VisionI mean after allum I had a bunch of vision issues thatfortunately are corrected but you know II do experience for instance when I wakeup in the morning if I look at my phonewhich by the way folks I try and getoutside and see sunlight first beforeever looking at the phone but I'llnotice when I first look at my phone inthe morning that I can see it veryclearly through my right eye but that ifI cover my right eye my left eye isextremely blurry to the point where I'mlike oh I'm calling Jeff you know I'mI'm afraid but then over the course ofmaybe 10-15 minutes it resolves and Idon't think it's because something's inmy eye I don't think it's pressure ofhaving slept on that side I don't thinkit's a lubrication of the eye issueum but the two eyes seem to come intoFocus so to speak um at different ratesearly in the day and if I pop my readerson I can see right away so I will usereaders late in the day oftenum if I want to read at night orsomething that's right just it feels somuch more relaxing I feel like like Ican finally relax whereas otherwise Irealize that I'm straining in order tosee does is there any um clinicalclinical data and what I just describedyeah you know Andy I'll tell you mystory that's like that andum we were living down in San Diego whenyou and I were both professors at UC SanDiegoand uh we had moved into a house and Ifound a pair of glasses a pair ofreading glasses uh in a closet and youknow we asked around you know did any ofthe grandparents uh leave some glassesbehind nobody seemed to know who theywere so we finally just decided likewell I guess the people who moved out ofthe house just left a pair of glassesyou know in this in the back of thisclosetand then I tried the glasses onand I looked at my phone up close andwas just like oh my God wait a second Ididn't realize how blurry my near Visionwas and this is back I was about 40 42something like that soso I didn't even realize until I put onthe readers and these wereyou know 1.25 magnifiers you know soawesome yeahand I'll tell youI got addicted because who doesn't likegood Vision right right I mean oh my Godnow I can make the type smaller on myphone I can you know it was wonderfuland you can relax a bit I mean themusculature that's responsible for formoving the lens and focusing the eye andthen all this extraocular musculatureand we forgot I mean I'm definitelygoing crow's feetum around my eyes uh probably because Iyou know squint or something but youknow just the ability to relax one'sface it just feels like you know moremore energy I feel like can be devotedto what we're actually looking at yeahwe're not making light of this yeah wellpretty soon I just kept that one pair ofglasses with me all the time and I wouldjust keep them in a pocket and whip themout whenever I was you know working atnear using my phone at a little greaterdistance like a typical computerdistance I could still see the computerfine so it really started for like kindof that close-up phone it was it was Icould get into here but not all the wayinto hereand um yeah and then pretty soon I wasjust totally addicted and so you knowthen I had to go buy 10 pairs and leavethem one by the bedside table you knowone in the car one in the computer bagone on everything I work at yeah becauseI'd leave them anywhere and forget themyeah exactly you know yeahsoum yeah sowhether using the readersaccelerates the progression ofdependence on the readers is still uhnot you know that's still up for debateyou know some studies say maybe yeahsome studies say maybe no but certainlypsychologically we get addicted to goodeasy vision and if you don't have tosquint and if you're not straining yourmuscles and all of a sudden the text onyour phone looks crisper again uh boythat's addictive you're gonna like goodvision and so it feels like you'regetting dependent and how much of thatis changing the eye muscles and how muchof that is just the psychology ofwanting to have good Vision I thinkprobably the jury's a little bit out onthat point but point being you're eithereither way your dependence will grow andas you continue to age 40s 50s up untilabout 60 65.the ability to shape that lens getsweaker and weaker and weaker and so youneed to move from the 0.5 to the 1.0 tothe 1.5s and to the coke bottle to thecode well thankfully not you eventuallymax out at about plus 2.5 or plus threebecause that's the amount of extrarefractive power that you need inmagnifiers to take the equivalent ofyour Infinity viewing and bring it up to14 inches to read it near basically youneed a plus three and then you don'tneed anylens eye muscle action whatsoever so youkind of max out around 2.5S or threesso because most people will hit thissomewhere in their 40s this sort of likegosh I'm having trouble on the phoneI think most people actually use thatthat's like kind of the first time for alot of people they're like well I guessI should go to the eye office right seethe optometrist or maybe ophthalmologistand when they go in they should begetting the standard in either of thoseoffices will be to give you a fullscreening exam including maybe it's thepuff test or a blue light test or alittle pen that can check your eyepressure and having a look inside andseeing if you're retina optic nerve lookhealthy it's kind of screening for allthe main diseases and so and they'lltell you at that point hey you lookgreat if you feel like your glassesaren't doing it for you in a year orthree years come back or they might sayhey I've detected something I'm worriedabout you and they'll set up a routinefor your ongoing Eye Careassuming that

I'mstationary night blindum I think the mutation for stationarynight blindness was identified in theColusa horse or something like thatthese were horses that you could walk upto very easily and they wouldn't evensee you until you're right theresomeone's going to correct me on thisit's the internet but I think that themutation was identifiedum Etc but I don't think I'm stationarynight blind but I do find that drivingat night I get very fatigued and thenI'll sometimes even wear my plus onereaders when I drive at night whichremoves the fatigue even though I'mlooking more or less at a distance arethere some conditions that make it hardfor people to see at night for whichthey would want corrective lensesum and what what sorts of biologyunderlies that assuming that somebody isnot stationary night blind or a Colusa Ithink is the name of the breed horseyeah that's a great question you know wefor the for the optical defects in oureyes most or many of which can becorrected with just having the rightprescription lenses we can get away withit without using those Corrections inbrighter lightand so during the daytimeum you know you could be slightly blurryyou know if I have a real bright lightuh and a good high contrast book youknow with black letters on the whitepage I can get away with reading thatwithout my readers unlike if if I'm indim light then I feel and that might bekind of what you're describing if you'rereading at night you actually prefer touse the readers a little more even atnight because we can make up for a lotof that blur if we just have brightenough signal and contrast coming intoour eyes makes sense yeah so when you'redriving at night and noticing this thismight be revealing a little bit of aneed for glasses now I'm not suggestingthis is the answer but far more commonthan having congenital stationary nightblindness would be being what's called alatent hyper rope okay now we talkedabout already how the lens inside oureye goes from focusing it distance tothen we squeeze the muscles the lensactually rounds up and allows us tofocus it nearsome people's Optical system of theireye is actually wired or designed orsort of set up in length not for regulardistance which would be anywhere fromabout three feet to Infinitybut it's actually designed it's actuallytuned for being beyond Infinity whichdoesn't make any actual sense when youtalk about it but just the Optics of theeye at their best Focus are actuallyfocusing the light behind the retina andand if you're doing that when you'reyounger you're actually using some ofyour focusing power to to use thosemuscles strain those muscles relax thatlens round up that lens and have yourvision Focus From Beyond Infinity tonormal distance like distance vision andso if you're a latent hyperope you areconstantly using those muscles and againif you're tired it's the end of the dayyour muscles are feeling a littlefatigued uh your latent hyperopia or bythe way if you've had a drink or twoalcohol can do this too your latenthyperopia can kind of kick in especiallyas we're age and we're not as good atrefocusing that lens anyway and now allof a sudden your vision is kind ofreverting to its natural state which isslightly out of focus at distancebecause it's actually focused beyondInfinity if you will and so all of asudden you put on that plus one just fora little extra booster kick and you'relike oh yeah yeah distance vision isclean and easy now soI'll have to bring you into the clinicto really be sure but you could beexhibiting a little bit of that kind oflatent hyperopia I

aboutwhether or not to rely on correctivelenses and that is from the time I waspretty young I could make my sisterlaugh by deviating one eye inward so notcrossing my eyes but moving one eyeInward and then what happened was when Iwas in college and studying a lot a lotand getting very fatigued I noticed thatthis I started just kind of drifting alittle bit so I went to the campusHealth Center and they gave me aprescription for a prism lens which ofcourse redirects the image but then Inoticed that this eyeball moving Inwardand I guess for those of you watching onuh on YouTube and not just listening umI can do thisum by just moving one eye in all rightas I can move this side yeah it's afairly pronounced it started to reallydrift in at a relaxation State and Istarted seeing double again so I thoughtwhoa these prism this one prism lens isa crutch of the sort that I really don'twant crushed the glasses it broke themand it never went back to themum I have voluntary control over it butthat's one example where the correctivelens can actually create a prettysignificant shift in eye position if onerelies on it so this gets back to thisissue ofum when should people Force themselvesto work with their natural vision maybedo some more far viewingum as opposed and certainly get outsideand get sunlight into the sunlight fullspectrum light as opposed to relying onactive lenses yeah and and you've raiseda very important distinction here andthat's the distinction between themuscles that are inside our eye that weuse to relax and refocus the lens andthe muscles that are on the outside ofthe eyeball of course inside our orbitbut on the outside of the eyeball thatturn the eyes and if everything'sworking right keeps our eyes reallyyoked straight and we talked aboutearlier uh this possibility that you mayhave been having a little bit ofintermittent esotropia or intermittentturning in of the eyes that thenculminated on that day of a day at thepool when you really noticed itand your ongoing ability to actuallyturn one eye in could be related to thatI remember as a kid standing in front ofthe mirror and I I couldn't get my eyesto cross even though friends could do itand you know so you know I I was in thelosing group on that on that end youbecame an ophthalmologist and then Ibecame an ophthalmologist and I must sayit is very reassuring that you haveexcellent Vision you know I always worrywhen I go to a new dentist and then Ilook up at them in one moment and ifthey're not wearing a mask that theirteeth are not you know pristine I thinkwell what am I doing here so at you knowan ophthalmologist with excellent Visionbrings me uh great comfort the toddler'schildren should have shoes right exactlyum but yeah so so when to correct whennot to correct with lenses and I realizehere we haven't talked at all aboutcontacts we've been talking abouteyeglasses yeah let's come to contactsin a sec if you want but yeah let mereturn to your question the differencebetween providing corrective lenses thatallow you to focus for near or distanceuh in your glasses so that you can goeasy on the inside the eye eye musclehaving to work so hard a lot of peopleget eye strain and sort of uh headacheseven from that from not having adequatecorrection that they're wearing that'sdifferent actually especially when we'rechildren or again into that maybe eveninto the teens and even young adultyearsfrom the eye muscles on the outside ofthe eyes which are supposed to be yokingour eyes straight and so that you havethem both looking at the same point inspace and and there it's actually quitea common treatment to try to undercorrect and ask people to exercise andnot just give a prism that says hey ifyour eyes in sometime we'll use a prismso the light sort of looks right to youbut rather under correct that and sortof really force you to exercise tryingto yoke your two eyes straight togetherand so that's that's in contrast andthey're actually I think manyoptometrists who often specialize in inwhat are the right glasses to give in asituation like that wherever possibleespecially duringuh development as our bodies aredeveloping as we're sort of growing inour younger years uh take the approachof intentionally trying to under correctnot use a prism or not use a full prismcorrection uh and um to really help uhsometimes it's also like anaccommodative reflex that your eyes arejust you're spending so much timereading it near when you read it nearyour eyes actually naturally turn in alittle bit to focus uh at that nearer sothat they can be looking at the sameword on the page and that can also ifyou've got kind of too much muscle driveyou can overshoot that and so sometimesjust using not a prism but like a littlebit of a plus lens in kids just so theydon't have to work quite so hard to turntheir eyes in and sort of over exercisethose muscles these are all greatexamples we're going to an eye careprovider often for these kinds of issuesan optometrist is the right first placeto startyou'd like to say that every optometristand every ophthalmologist is alwaysgoing to give the exact right thing forfor each kid or young adult or olderadult to do and and we wish all medicalcare providers were were always right onTarget and a lot of times it's a perfectscience but a lot of times it's animperfect science and so it could bethat at least with you know we're now 2025 30 years later but like it could bethat today that 20 year old version ofyourself would have been given adifferent uh approach to having one eyeintermittently occasionally turning inlike that is there any real value toum near far exercises you know so-called"

sorts ofthings that anyone can just do I meanwhenever possible we like to share toolsfor various aspects of Health on thispodcast but of course we don't wantpeople cowboying this stuff in a waythat could be detrimental to their totheir Vision so is it okay to get onYouTube and find a smooth Pursuit umTool uh we can put a link to these therethere are several of themum and people spend a few minutes doingthis yeahyou're definitely not going to hurtanything so totally fine to do it andsome people may notice you know likethey feel a little more visually activeif they do these kinds of exercisesum I think most people would do them andnot notice something in their daily lifewe actually haveummade so much progress you know inresearch in thinking about how do wetake the diseased or dysfunctioning oraging eye and get it back to healthy andnormalbut there's a whole other area ofscience that's we're really just barelytouching we've actually we've actuallyjust opened a vision performance centerto really get at not just how do werehab the sick eye back to health butwhat's the difference betweenfunctioning normally and functioningabove normallyfor example athletes when they getstudied for visual Visioncharacteristics they have faster visualreflexes higher visual Acuity uh howmuch of that was you know genetic howmuch of that is trained we don't reallyunderstand could we train all of us withyou know normal vision to get up toSupra normal vision these are like greatimportant questions that are reallyrelevant to you know every regularperson of course you know people doingEsports and the gaming communities andathletes is part of what we're studyingin the vision performance center butthese are really really bigopportunities to try to understand howdo we move people from normal vision toSuper normal vision and there's evidencethat you can do it so here's a greatexample some athletes trainusing these special goggles thatactually use electrical signals in theglasses part of the goggles to actuallyblack out your vision one thirtieth ofevery second two thirtieths of everysecond three thirtieths of every secondnow imagine you and I are passing abasketball back and forth except you'rewearing goggles and all of a suddenyou're only getting 90 percent of thedata of where's that basketball on itsway to my hands now you're only gettingeighty percent now you're only getting70 percent of that visual informationand you are practicing right you aregetting good at catching a basketballwhen you only have a fraction of thevisual information and now I put youback on the basketball court without thegoggles you might be really good atpassing that basketball around andcatching that basketball right and sothe idea that we could train andunderstand the biology of training toget the eyes from normal to supernormalPerformance I think it's an amazing areaand one that we've really just startedto dig into that's fantastic so this isa a new program at Stanford through thedepartment of Ophthalmology is it linkedup at all with the woosai performanceInstitute yeah actually there's been alot of focus over the years I think inhuman performance and there's actually anew human performance uh Alliance andCenter we've we've we've long had reallyrun through the department of ourOrthopedics a human performancelaboratory that's really you know muchmore about joints and muscles andstrength and conditioning and stretchingto layer on to that now a realunderstanding of how vision is operatingyou know it's interesting let's go backto the example of concussion you knowwe've got I don't know about 800 Varsitystudent athletes and all the differentsports at Stanford and you might have astudent athlete come in and say you knowsomething doesn't feel right I got alittle hit on the head I feel like myvision is a little bit messed up maybeI've got a mild concussion you couldimagine doing some of these tests onsome of these performance athletes forexample and saying well gosh you looknormalbut actually they used to be operatingat a supernormal rate and this is anoticeable decrement for them and sojust starting to study and understandwhat's the difference between normal andsupernormal how do we go back and forthbetween those two how do we measure thatdifference and maybe ultimately how dowe train into that difference I thinkit's going to be exciting and not justfor athletes you know for for regularpeople you know you talk about drivingat night is there a solution where wecould train our eyes to be better atdriving at night and I don't know maybereduce the number of accidents thathappen out in the world so wellcertainly there'sum physical training protocols which areredefining what a 60 year old or 70 yearoldcould look like and feel like and beable to perform like why not do the samefor visionum so I don't think there's anythingSupernatural or greedy about doing it Ithink that's the excitement of biologyand neuroplasticity that you can extendit forward as opposed to just trying towire up correctly during developmentthis is a perfect time for me to ask youa question that I'd love a clear answer"

            "text": "talk about Lasik that we talk a littlebit about contact lenses is there anydetriment to having a piece of glass ora piece of plastic on the front of youreye all the time and the reason I ask isnot because I think we should livenecessarily exactly like our ancestorsbut it's a pretty bizarre adaptationto put a lens directly onto the front ofthe eye you have to imagine that thecells and tissues there are accustomedto getting a certain amount of oxygenthey're accustomed to get a certainamount of interaction with theenvironment and and you also are nowadding another surface the way that thetears are going to interact with theum you know with the cornea of the eyeare probably changed and who knows maybeit doesn't make any negative differenceat all but you know putting a contactlens on the front of the eye is you knowabout as close to putting a device onyour brain as I can think of except formaybe the cochlear uh implant yeah yeahthat's a great question now first of allum I want to distinguish uh there are afew really medical uses for differentkinds of contact lenses like scleralcontact lenses for people of certaindiseases there are other kinds but Ithink what we really want to talk aboutright now is just kind of therun-of-the-mill I want to get myprescription taken care of but insteadof wearing glasses I'm going to wearcontactscontacts even the newest generationcontacts yes they sort of uh change thetier Dynamics on the surface of your eyetheyum they decrease the oxygen you knowdiffusion that's just sort of out in theair onto the surface of our eye onto thecells that are on the surface of our eyebut most of us especially as we'reyounger have enough tear film Reserveenough oxygen Reserve that we can easilytolerate these polymer gel soft contactlenses and and wear them happily theadvantage of contact lenses over glassespurely from the perspective ofcorrecting your vision is that there'sdifferent elements of of of of of theshape of your eye that need to becorrected if you need corrective lensesand so for example if you're for thebasketball shape of your eye is a littletoo steep or a little too shallow that'swhat the standard glasses correct youmay have been told that you havesomething called astigmatism that'swhere instead of having a basketballshaped eye you have a slightly footballshaped die it's not round in the samedimensions on both axes and againglasses can correct that but thenthere's higher order aberrations in ourcorneas in the clear window in the frontof our eyes or or to some degree in thelens inside the eye that are that arefocusing the light that the glassesprescription can't correct but if youhave a nice smooth contact lens on thefront it can correct so a lot of peoplewho wear glasses and contacts willreport that they have a much higherquality of vision with their contactlens correction than with their glassescorrection and again in service ofenjoying the best Vision that you canenjoy in your daily life that's anupside to seeing if contacts could workFrio now there's another element thoughand that's like gosh is there a risk ofcontact lenses and especially as we ageum we have less tear film reserves socontacts may become less tolerable as weageand the other thing is being really goodabout the cleaning because you know thecontacts can trap bacteria or fungus andif you get a corneal infection from acontact lens it actually can be quitedevastating to your cornea even if yousuccessfully treat the infection you canbe left with some corneal scarringthankfully this happens very rarely butwhen it does happen it can be quitedifficult on you know on the personthereafter to sort of suffer throughhaving maybe a scar from that infectionon the surface of their cornea that theythat leads to some blurring vision forexample so we always recommend that ifyou're going to wear contacts that you'dbe really attentive to whether you'retolerating them welland then also to be really attentive tothe recommended use and cleaning of thecontact lenses I actually recommend thateven though they're a little moreexpensive to afford that people shouldalmost always be just using the dailycontact lenses that they don't have toclean or use for you know two weeks orfour week period so these are disposablecontacts highly disposable and I hate tothink of you know I don't know fillingour oceans or what have you with uh moremore more polymer plastic but at leastthe contact lenses are small and it'smuch safer for your eye to use a dailydisposable than to use a two week or afour week and be responsible for thecleaning the other thing to be reallyresponsible about is sleeping in themovernight because overnight when youreyelids are closed of course now you'regetting even less oxygen to the surfaceof your eye actually most bacteriaespecially many of the Infectiousbacteria to our bodies and to thesurface of our eye are actually bacteriathat Don don't really like oxygen and sowe've got a low risk of gettingbacterial infections on the surface ofour eye but if we use contacts too muchdon't clean them or sleep in themovernight when our eyelids are closedand now there's even less oxygen kind ofhelping keep the surface more more cleanif you will that increases the risk alot so being really good with therecommended use and cleaning of thecontacts is critical considering dailyuse contacts you don't have to and lookmost contacts are going to be the twoweek or four-week kind where you putthem in the cleaning solution overnighteach time give them a good rinse and putthem back in the next day and again mostpeople 99.99 some percent of people aregoing to do just fine with that followthe instructions and never get intotroubleas we age they're going to become lesstolerable people are going to say I usedto wear my contacts for 12 hours now myeyes feel really dry after six or eightor ten hoursmaybe some years after that they saygosh I could barely use it for fourhours I only use them when I go out on aSaturday night uh and and that's okayyou can you can you can back off as youneed to back off but in the meantime ifit helps you especially in the youngerdecades if it helps you really enjoy uhYour Best Vision greatwhat about UV protection in eyeglass"

            "text": "lenses and or contactsI've dealt with many questions aboutblue light I am not somebody whobelieves that all blue light is terribleI think it's important to avoid BrightLights of any wavelength late at nightif you want your melatonin production tobe normal and you want to sleep well itdoesn't matter if you're wearing blueblockers or not if you're just underblastingly Bright Lights it's going tosuppress your melatonin and yet somepeople enjoy blue blockers for thatreason nowadays A lot of people wearblue blockerglasses or blue blocking lenses orcontacts throughout the entire daythinking that blue light is bad for oureyes during the day I happen tosubscribe to the idea that we want asmuch bright light as we safely cantolerate during the day ideally fromsunlightin order to set our circadian rhythm andyet a lot of eyeglasses and a lot ofcontact lenses out there have UV a andor UVB blocking features to them so whatare your thoughts on this and I'mperfectly happy to be wrong and revisemy my stance on thisum yeah what what do you think aboutthis UV a B blocking yeah it's a goodit's it's a it's really important todistinguish that UV light on the lightspectrum is right next to blue light redlights on the other end and of courseinfrared is beyond that and our eyesother animals can see these but our eyescan't see infrared that's why we call itBeyond red and we can't see ultravioletwe call it Beyond violet UV light isright next to Blue Light UV light isknown to have a lot of adverse effectsit's not really good for our skin andtherefore you know we really want toavoid Sunburn and kind of UV data youknow exposure and damage on our skinsimilarly it's not really good on oureyes and it affects both the ocularsurface a little bit in terms of likekind of how dry or irritable your eyesmight feel for some people and certainlyover the long term UV light willaccelerate the formation of cataractwhich is a blurring of an oxidativeblurring of the lens inside the eyeprofound UV light can be damaging to theretina if you're getting way too much onthe insideso uh so blocking UV light I believe isjust absolutely standard in every pairof eyeglasses and I don't know actuallyhow much to what degree the differentkinds of contact lenses also filter atleast UV light now blue blockers blueblocking glasses is totally differentandas I say like I think almost all glassesbecause the Plastics almost all glassesare not made of glass anymore they'remade of plastics but I think almost allof them now filter the UV light whichagain is like probably the safe move forour eyes and periocular environmentaround the eye environmentso blue blockers you know that's been ahuge fan I'll tell you the last threeyears through the pandemic everybodygetting on their computer hours in frontof Zoom meetings where we used to walkfrom building to building for a meetingthings like thatum I you know I I remember you know likethis sort of big uptick in these kindsof questions and I'm not sure thatthere's any data that blocking blue ishelpful in any way and as you say it mayactually play into sort of circadianentrainment of our natural daily Rhythmso so I think blocking UV is a good ideaand I think it's pretty standard youknow they make glasses is by the waythat actually react to UV light they'recalled transitions there may be a fewdifferent brands I don't know uh but butyou know these are the sunglasses thatare clear except then they turn dark ifyou're out in the sunlight and it's notjust any sunlight it's actually the UVwavelengths that that cause the chemicalreaction in the glasses to turn fromfrom Clear see-through to to sunglassblocked glassesand umyou may notice if you if any of you outthere are using these kinds of glassesuh that they don't work in the caryou'll wear them in the car and theywon't go to sunglasses even though it'ssunny out and again that's because allstandard car glass also filters UVthat's why if you're riding around inthe car and it's sunny out you've gotyour hand you know up next to the windowuh wearing a t-shirt you never get asunburn through the car window anymorebecause all our car glasses alsofiltering UV light for us so so that's avery informative answer and before westarted recording you and I werediscussing this practice of morningsunlight viewing which again I highlyrecommend over and over and you pointedout that low solar angle sunlight sosunlight low in the sky viewed for maybe10 minutes a morning and again notforcing oneself to look at it and starebut blinking as needed is not going tocause extensive UV damage to the eyesit's really the when the sun is directlyoverhead that we're getting a lot of UVwhich raises this other question whichis for people that don't wear correctivelenses and therefore are not blocking UVlight to the eyesum what should they do are they introuble should they be wearing a brimmedhat brimmed Hat's a great idea that I'vegot a rid of a lot of the direct lightinto the eye of course you still havereflected light off of surfaces and thatthat can include UV light of courseum you know wearing sunglasses outsideeven if you don't have corrective lensesyou know it's may also be morecomfortable to wear sunglasses outsideum so so these are all fine you knowat the end of the day it's probably notmaking a huge difference in the healthof your eye whether you've spent thelast 50 years wearing sunglasses reallydogmatically for your outdoor time ornot you know if you were going todevelop let's just say age-relatedcataracts inside your eyes whichwe'll all get if we all live to 120 weall get cataracts you know it's going tohappen some people younger some peopleolder maybe if you were really dogmaticabout wearing your UV blockingsunglasses maybe you'd get your yourcataracts at 75 years old instead of 72years old it may not be a hugedifference in that regard so again notsomething to be super stressed I thinkit's I think it's more a question ofjust what are you comfortable in uh andthen certainly I will say the the otheradvantage of a wide brim hat is it'skeeping sun off of your face and theseare the you know some of the especiallythe upturned portions of your face likethe cheeks and the nose these are thesome of the most common places to getsome of the skin cancers that you canget over a lifetime of sunlight exposureso you know the wide brain app is it'shelping you for that as wellcan't help but ask about comfort"

I'lljust say that you know right up front itis amazing people will come out of Lasiksurgery uh better than 2020 but uh thecornea we talked about before that's theClear Window on the front of your eyeall the light has to get through thereand we talked about before already likeif your cornea is misshapen if thebasketball shape of it is too tooshallow or too steep then you're goingto need glasses to see a distance andalso at near if it's to football insteadof basketball then it's going to be whatwe call astigmatism and uh and then youcan't you need a correction for thatinstead of correcting with glasses thatsort of help shape the light so it cango through your slightly off-shapedcornea instead of wearing contact lenseswhich also shape the light just as it'sentering your cornea right on thesurface of the eye you can just reshapethe corneaand the way Lasik does that there's afew different versions of Lasik butbasically the way the Lasik does that isit actually ablates or uh gets rid of alittle ring or rim of that cornealtissueso that for example if you were a littleshallow and you got rid of a little bitof that tissue around the edge with thelaser the Lasik you know starts with theword laser if you got rid of that edgetissue then you're sort of making it alittle more basketball shaped right orif you were too steep on your cornea andyou used the laser to kind of shave offa little bit of the the tip of thatbasketball right then you're flatteningit out flattening out the cornea so it'sthat kind of reshaping and thetechnology has come so far that theLasik procedures can actually correctnot just the regular aberrations that wetalked about but also some of thesehigher order aberrations and there aredifferent monikers for this kind ofLasik it's all I think become fairlystandard but wave front guided whereit's actually using light waves tomeasure with a very exact localizationexactly how much and where to laser foreach individual eye to make that corneapass the light as ideally as possiblenow one or a few percent of patientswill actually have a dry eye problem soafter a Lasik because so it doesinterfere a little bit with thosecorneal nerves for example and I and Ido think that if you're a person whoalready has dry eye hopefully if you'reasking your eye surgeon about Lasikhopefully you're being counseled that ifyou have dry eye this might not be agood idea for you just like contactsmight not be a good idea for you if youalready have a lot of dry eye but for alot of people especially a lot ofyounger people it's quite common I Ithink the statistics suggests maybe 15or 20 percent of people who wouldbenefit from LASIK you know who whowould who would otherwise be wearingglasses may get Lasik at some point intheir life andum you know I used to jokeyou know Lasik it costs more money thana pair of glasses butit doesn't cost more money than 10 pairsof prescription glasses over the courseof a decade or two you know and so Iused to joke that gosh if uh if everyonehad to have laser eye surgery for theirbest visionand someone came along and said hey I'vegot an invention you don't have to havelaser eye surgery anymore it rests onthe ears and the bridge of your nose Icall them glasses could they have soldthose for a thousand two thousanddollars a pair I don't know maybe butyou know there's kind of a culturalelement of saying you know like I don'twant to wear glasses you know I'd loveto be able to walk around withoutrelying on glasses or contacts of coursepeople are very athletic or spending alot of their time doing Athletics theymay be quite irritated to have to dealwith glasses or contacts people who havevery severe prescriptions I mean if youwake up and you can't even really youknow you're fumbling for your glasses onthe bedside table because you have sucha strong strong prescription you can'teven see what it says on the alarm clocknext to the bed you know these are allgroups of patients who like reallychange their daily lives by getting outof glasses or contacts and takingadvantage of Lasik and in I don't know99 of the time it's going to be like asafe comfortable outcome for the patientdo they do Lasik on kidsum there are certain conditions uhunusual cordial conditions whereprocedures like Lasik get used but Ibelieve uh it's ideal to not do it onchildren uh or even even young teenagersand the reason goes back to what we weretalking about before you are much morelikely to change the shape of your eyeand therefore the prescription you needand therefore what exactly the Lasikwould laser while you're still in thosegrowing years and you really want to beable to say hey my eyeglassesprescription has not changed in the lasttwo or three or five years because ifyou do Lasik and then your eye keepschanging shape then by the next year allof a sudden the lasik's not doing you'rebacking glasses again right you can do atouch-up Lasik do a little bit more butit's generally you know you're going tobe a happier person if you've reachedthat point in your life and maybe that'smaybe that's your late teens morecommonly it's into the 20s where youreye has stopped changing itsprescription every year you've

I realized that there aremillions and millions of people thatreally suffer from dry eye and for whomstandard drops are just not working sowhat underlies dry eye is it somedeficiency in the lacquer hormone glandsthat produce tears for the eye and and Ithink of Tears as just kind of saltywaterand I wonder if they are more than thatis there an oil in there and if we knowwhat's in tears why can't somebody justmanufacture something that works as wellas tears yeah you know it turns out youknow we we've got a lot of other eyediseasesbut by far the most common eye diseaseand and I've been told by far the mostcommon eye treatment you know purchasedby anyone now granted it's almost alwaysover the counter things like artificialtears is for dry eyeand uh in part that's because as we ageourtier quantity goes down and our tierquality goes down and so what do thosedo meanwe have two different major elements totiers and as you alluded to one is thesalt water porn of part of the tears andthose are made primarily by the lacrimalgland and there's a steady drip of thosetears onto the ocular surface as well asreflexive tearing right if you get aneyelash in your eye or or you cry yourlacrimal ground will actually squeezeout extra salt water tears uh onto thesurface of the eye and so so that'sthat's where most of the sort of wetpart is coming from but there's alsoessential oils critical oils these comefrom other types of glands includingglands in our eyelids called meibomianglands and the oils form a surface overthe salt water part of the tear filmand and also intermix into the tears andas we age we go down in the quantity ofboth salt water part of our tears andoil part of our tears but also thequality and in particular the oil partsuh can often be seen to be going downmore quicklythe the eye drop industry has prettymuch solved for replacing the salt waterpart of your tears right you can geteither bottles of preserve preservativecontaining you know you could use thatbottle all month or for a month or twoor you can buy these strips ofpreservative free artificial tears whichare really basically like the salt watercomponents and you can use thosepreservative free ones we have patientsusing them every hour if they need toright you're not going to hurt anythingwith preservative free artificial tearsyou just drop them in just drop them inyeah either I as as often as you want orneed when you feel it it's exacerbatedin the world we live in uhespecially these days now with more timeon computer it turns out that when youread including when we maybe used toread more books than we do now but alsoread on the computer or stare at thecomputer screen or work on the computeror actually just even watch the TVI've done very careful studies you blinkless when you're doing any of thoseactivitiesand when you blink glass you'reredistributing the tears lesseffectively and you're squeezing outless of the tears including less of theoils as effectively as you could be whenyou're blinking and soum so between aging tier quality tierquantitya lot of our activitieswe're kind of in this losing propositionnow now I mentioned that uh we're prettygood at replacing the wet salty part ofour tears but actually as an industry wehaven't really figured out ahow to really effectively replace theoily part and the oils do a few thingsincluding when you have a layer of oilon top of a layer of waterthe water is less likely to evaporateand so the oils help hold the tears onthe surface of your eye and so if we'renot making as many or as good oils aspart of our tear film that's uh that'salso like kind of working against thesalt water part of our tearsum so yeah as an industry as a communityuh that we haven't really figured outhow to get the oil part solved foreither by effectively replacing the oilsortreating our eyelids in a way kind ofrejuvenating those oil glands gettingthem to kind of go back to theiryouthful State again you know so thatthe eyes including the eyelids and theoil glands unfortunately they're agingjust like the rest of our body so sothis is this this is one of the majorfeatures uh is uh is dry eye and and uhand it's tough on patients because youfeel it it's really tough because youfeel it yeah I have yet anotherexperience to report where when I hadthe blepharitis which fortunately wastransient I also experienced it everytime I would blink I could feel theblink and boy I'll tell you I we allmost of us take for granted uh what apleasure it is to not observe theblinking of our eyes because for those Ithink in last about two weeks every timeI blink I'd feel an almost sandpaperlike experience it wasn't particularlypainful but it was very uncomfortablebecause it suddenly conscious of everyblink and it's very very distracting nowthat resolved when the blepharitisresolved but I can't even imagine whatit would be like to deal with that allday long every day yeah really Dreadfulyes it really is and it and so you'reabsolutely right it's a very it's one ofour really big unmet needs and andalthough for most people with dry eye itcan be managed with just the regularover-the-counter artificial teardropsyou can buy at the grocery store or overthe counter at the pharmacy for a subsetof people who have really much moresevere symptoms with the dry eye it'sit's really it's hard it's a really hardthing to have to live with all the timeand and we Counsel on the use of Tearswe Council on the use of eyelid cleaninglike we talked about before where youtake either these eyelid scrubs or alittle dilute baby shampoo to keep thoseeyelashes really clean that keeps thoseoil glands functioning at their topcapacity for you uh so that you'remaximizing you know high quality cheerproduction reducing inflammation is alsoimportant whether that's inflammation"

            "text": "from allergy and of course a lot ofpeople's dry eye gets much worse in thespring with seasonal allergies whenpollen is around if you have dustallergies in your home uh that worsensyour symptomatic dry eyeor other forms of inflammation there's athere's an element of dry eye that weactually think isinflammation kind of working against ourtear glands and and in fact some of theprescription drops now to help combatmore severe dry eye uh areanti-inflammatory or even low-dosesteroid types of eye dropsum so I think these are all uh sort ofNext Generation treatments I think atthe at the really Leading Edge of NextGeneration treatment is trying to betterunderstand the nerves on the cornea andocular surface and if there are waysthat we could better treat them and helphelp regenerate and rejuvenate kind ofhow the nerves and the and the tissuecells are interacting underneath thattear film and that's where for somepatients we can actually use either forexample blood serum your blood serum isactually very rich in growth factorsand many of those growth factors itturns out empirically are really helpfulfor people with dry eye so if you're oneof those people who's been reallystruggling with with dry eye you mightask your eye care provider hey I heardabout serum tears is that something thatcould help me serum tears because thisPRP is this platelet-rich plasma relatedbut but not the plate platelet-richportion at least not yet they can drawyour blood spin out all the cells you'releft with the kind of liquid part ofyour blood that's the serum and thenthey can dilute that with some saltwater maybe with some preservatives insome cases yeah you could keep it inyour freezer thaw a bottle when you'reready to use it you know each few weeksand and then use it just like aneyedropper bottle and those serum tearsuh actually can be very helpful forpeople with with much more advanced orsevere hard to control dry eye symptomsuh companies are really trying to figureout hey what are the most importantparts of the the serum can we justidentify and package just the growthfactor and uh and turn that into aproduct for dry eye patients and sothere's a lot of research on the ocularsurface and dry eye uh going intoum going into that space right now I'lltell you the one other recommendationthat I always give patientsthere's a fair amount of evidence thatif you're getting too much of some ofthese preservative chemicals which ofcourse if you're going to use an eyedrop bottle for a month it should have apreservative in it right so that youknow open the bottle and then it growsbacteria a couple weeks later and nowyou're you're you know you're usingcontaminated eye drops so for bottlesit's typical to have preservatives but Ireally recommend for patients if they'reusing anything more than a couple dropshere and there for their dry eye controlto actually go for one of thepreservative free artificial tears theycome in lots of Brands I'm sure thehouse brands at any of the pharmaciesuse them too I make them too and theseare the ones that come in like stripsplastic strips and you break one off youbreak off the little cap you can use asmuch as you want all day you have tothrow that one out if you have anythingleft over you have to throw it out atthe end of the night and the next daybreak off a new one because there's nopreservatives and once you open it youdon't want bacteria to grow in that saltwater right but it's really good becausethe preservatives can be very irritatingor even inflammatory to the ocularsurface to the surface of our eyes so wereally do want to if we're using morethan a drop or twoupgrade that cost a little bit moremoney if they're still over the counterupgrade yourself to the preservativefree artificial tears those are greatrecommendations I'm also reallyinterested in this serumthing uh because you know we're thisdiscussion taking place 10 years ago andI raise PRP platelet-rich plasma therewould probably be a lot of eye rolls nopun intended because I think myself anda lot of other people in the let's callthe sort of standard scientific andmedical community looked atplatelet-rich plasma right alongsidestem cell therapies because they werecheek to jowl back then as you recallbefore the FDA regulations about stemcell claims which we will get toum of coursePRP was suggested as a source of stemcells it turns out there are very few ifany true stem cells in PRP and yet nowas I understand it PRP is an FDAapproved protocol for injection into theuterus injection into pretty much everytissue and organ system of the body inorder to quote unquote rejuvenate it andhere I'm not promoting PRP and yet it isa very common practice now in morestandard medical clinics but it startedoff kind of Niche even gray Market kindof underground it's diverged from stemcell therapies and we're going to talkabout major modes of vision loss in amomentand this horrible situation thathappened down in Florida of a clinicinjecting stem cells into patients eyesto recover vision and it actuallyblinded them so we'll talk about stemcell therapies but for the record is PRPsomething that's now standard in majoroptimal ophthalmic clinics excuse meincluding your department at Stanfordare you drawing out blood spinning itdown taking plasma taking serum andre-injecting it or reapplying it topatients eyes not not yet inOphthalmology uh in eye clinics I Iwould say we're sort of like right nowon the edge of uh groups are starting tostudy that is it safe is it valuable isit any better for certain conditionslike on the ocular surface than serumTears For example this sort of dilutinga patient's own own blood serum uh so soit's being studied it's a very activearea now it turns out that this PRPplasma has uh you know again like a highconcentration nation of growth factorsthat's probably what's responsible for alot of the kind of quote tissueRejuvenation effects uh be that be theyas they may but but it's being studiedbut it's definitely not a standard ofcare yet uh at least in in Ophthalmologyspace and and you know I think wheneverthere's something really new it reallydeserves to be properly studied wetalked before about you know at firstyou're going to do trials where you justtest it carefully in a few people maybea few of the most severely effectiveaffected patients be really thoughtfulabout uh you know the ethics of tryingout for safety then as you develop alittle understanding of the safety youreally want to eventually get toproperly controlled randomized whatpeople in the community often calldouble blind trials but we inOphthalmology like to call Double maskedtrials blind is a bad wordtrials yeah yeah so you really wantproperly controlled trials testing is itreally working thing is it reallydeserve the claims that people aremaking and that has not yet really cometo fruition at that level forOphthalmology or Eye Care yet so we'vebeen talking a lot about normal

glaucoma things likeretinitis Pigmentosa maculardegeneration the things that if we couldwe would all avoid and yet are out therein the world at pretty high rates youknow I'm sure you'll share with us whatthose rates areand as bad as these things are there areways to detect and offset theirprogression so that people don'tnecessarily lose their Vision so if youcould could you share with us what arethe major forms of vision loss inchildhood and in adulthood and what caneach and all of us do in order to findout if we have one of these conditionsand therefore treat it effectively yeahthat's great you knowlet's start by justreminding ourselves what are the majorcauses of vision loss and these aregoing to differ where you are in theworldbut the major the number one cause oflow vision is actually refractive errorpeople who need glasses and especiallyin other countries affordability accesscan't even get glasses okay so that'sjust refractive error but that'sfundamentally correctablethe next most common cause of visionloss is cataract cataract is theblurring the Aging of the lens insidethe eye behind the cornea we talkedabout how that is responsible forfocusing light under the back of the eyeit also has to be clear enough that thelight gets through the lensand a cataract is a normal aging processyou know as I said if we all live to 100or 110 years old we'll all get cataractswe'll all need cataract surgery weactually is you know in in the eyeclinic we see cataracts years or evendecades before they're affecting yourvision in a meaningful way so that thecataracts are forming and that's okaybut at some point they get bad enoughthat it's time to take them out we'veactually solved for cataract surgerypretty efficiently we could do a four toeight minute surgery maybe if we'retaking our time it's 10 or 12 minutes ofsurgical time take out a cataract itworks beautifully 99 point somethingpercent of the time we put a plastic aclear plastic lens inside the eyeexactly where your lens used to be andthere's even lenses that can Flex orfocus light from far and near socataracts is fundamentally a there'sstill room for improvement but there'sit's fundamentally a solved problem theproblem is is that worldwide therearen't enough cataract surgeons there'snot access to care the Machinery or thelensescost too much money in developingcountries to get out to the number ofpeople who would need them so it'sactually just again an access to carecataract is a reversible treatableeasily treatable problembut it's number two on the list ofcauses of vision loss in the worldbecause we don't have enough access tocare we need a lot more sort ofprogramming around Global OphthalmologyGlobal Eye Care to solve for cataractjust to bring that solution to countriesaround the worldthen after that you start hitting theeye diseases that lead to what arecurrently irreversiblenon-reversible causes of vision loss thenumber one cause of irreversible visionloss in the world is glaucomaso what is glaucoma glaucoma is actuallyprobably a little cluster orconstellation of diseases that we lumptogether it's a degenerative diseaselike a neurodegeneration we talk aboutneurodegenerations in the brain likeAlzheimer's and Parkinson's glaucoma isa neurodegenerative disease it happensinstead of affecting one or differentarea in your brain it happens to affectthe optic nerve that connects the eye tothe brain and we need our optic nervesto carry all the visual information fromthe eye to the brain and so if youroptic nerve is degenerating in glaucomaand I should add there are other opticneuropathies so-called diseases of opticnerve degeneration for example you canget a stroke of the optic nerve you canhave an inflammatory disease likemultiple sclerosis called optic neuritisthat affects the optic nerve so you canget other optic nerve diseases butglaucoma is by far the most common opticneuropathy and the problem is is justlike you know just like spinal cordinjury which is also part of the centralnervous system right the brain thespinal cord the rat and the optic nervethat's the central nervous system andthere's no regeneration and that's whyspinal cord injury leads to permanentparalysis well optic nerve injury oroptic nerve degeneration unfortunatelyleads to permanent vision loss so in thecase of glaucoma how do we get ahead ofthatglaucoma has two major risk factors oneis increasing age there are actuallyinfantile and pediatric glaucomasunfortunately and those can be much moreaggressive much more damaging when theypresent so early in kids uh in babiesand in childrenmost of the kind of run-of-the-millglaucoma usually results presents inadulthood and even in in the Agingadults so much more common after 50 or60 or 70 years old increasing the othermain risk factor for glaucoma isincreasing eye pressure the eye actuallyyou know it stays inflated it's aballoon it has to stay inflated we needsome amount of eye pressure to keep oureye as a as an inflated balloon but ifthe eye pressure goes too high and wetalked about this before you won't evenfeel it if it slowly gets too high ifthe eye pressure goes too high thatcauses glaucoma andum and that's one of the things that wetalked about you really include in acomprehensive eye exam when you're justgetting a screening checkup at your eyecare provider at your optometrist orophthalmologist office they're going tocheck your pressure and just as ascreening tool check to make sure it'snot too highwe can treat glaucoma todayby trying to reduce the impact of thathigh pressure by lowering the eyepressure so we have treatments forglaucoma that Target the eye pressure wehave medications like eye drops we havelasers that can be used inside the eyethat can also lower the eye pressure andultimately if we need them we also havesurgeries that can also provide anoutflow that lets the fluid out of theeye in a controlled way so that the eyepressure can be brought back down intonormal rangesagain the reason that glaucomaends up being the number one cause ofirreversible blindness in the world isnumber onewe can't get those therapies everywherein the world the affordability of eyedrops the access to lasers or surgicalprocedures Around The World Isn't equalto what it is here and even within ourcountry you know people may not beaccessing Health Care effectively to getscreened for glaucoma or to get treatedfor glaucoma the other big problem withglaucoma is that it affects ourperipheral vision first and only verylate in the disease does it pinch in andfinally pinch off the center of ourvision in typical glaucomasand that's a real problem becausewe don't notice if our peripheral visionis down you know our peripheral visionisn't that good to begin with and ifyou're driving and you can see apedestrian step off the sidewalk youthink your peripheral vision is fine butactually your peripheral vision couldalready start being damaged by glaucomaand you won't notice it in regular dailylife and that's where the importance ofscreening and early detection reallycomes in for glaucomawhat we don't have for glaucoma we cancome back to like kind of what's TheCutting Edge of the future in these eyediseases what we don't have aretreatments that really Target the opticnerve degenerative process and we cancome back and talk about thatso that's glaucoma and opticneuropathies then the next two majorcauses of currently largely irreversible"

least at this point in humanhistory they can't be replaced althoughhopefully because of work that you'vedone in the other Laboratories are doingat some point that statement I just madewill not be true in the rgcs can bereplacedmeanwhile what can and should people doto find out if they have glaucomaand to treat glaucomaand is it true that even if somebody hasnormal pressure that lowering their eyepressure further protects them againstglaucoma yeah that's absolutely right somost important is to get screened with aformal exam at your optometrist orophthalmologist because you you won'tnotice you won't have any symptoms ifyour eye pressure is too high you won'tknow you're not likely to notice untilvery late in the disease if yourperipheral vision is being damagedthrough the course of glaucoma so mostimportant us have a screening exam agood comprehensive screening exam willalways include checking the eyepressures and also looking in the backof your eye the head of the optic nervewhere all the fibers leave the eye andcarry the optic nerve information backto the brain we can see that when welook inside your eye and uh and andglaucoma has a fairly characteristiclook to it in the optic nerve head so solooking at the optic nerve had uh wehave Imaging and peripheral visiontesting that can also be included inthose screening exams so if you reallyget a comprehensive screening exam youcan very reliably detect if you haveglaucoma to worry about or you're in theclearif you have glaucoma to worry about wehave treatments and you're absolutelyright whether you start with aabnormally high pressure or you startwith a pressure that's on the face of itin the normal rangein either case lowering the pressure hasbeen shown in large properly controlledclinical trials to slow the progressionof optic nerve damage and vision loss soabsolutely in either case starting withhigh pressure or starting with normalpressure in either case you've got tolower the pressure further and as Imentioned we have eye drops those areusually the first line there's very gooddata that there's a very benignnon-invasive laser it's not the samekind of laser that gets used for Lasikbut there's a benign very safe type oflaser called selective lasertrabeculoplasty SLT we call it andthat's also very effective as a firstline actually in the largest clinicaltrial from which the data have beencoming out just even over the last fewyears it's called the light trial in thelight trial patients with glaucoma wererandomly assigned to either get thelaser or the sort of most common firststrongest eye drop and uh that gets usedclinically and actuallyon many features they both worked atleast as well but when looking out overthe long term actually the laser hadsome advantages over the eye drop not inthe least of which by the way it's verynice for patients to not have to likeremember to use the eye drop every nightand so um so that's quite helpful Ithink uh to to keep in mind as atreatment option uh early in the courseof the disease of course if the eyedrops under our lasers are not enoughearly in the disease we also havesurgical approaches to lower the eyepressure further you know even with allof our treatments all of thesetreatments stepping patients through allof thisabout 10 15 even 20 percent of patientswill lose very meaningful functionalvision and maybe five ten fifteenpercent of patients especially dependingwhere you are in the world will go blindfrom glaucomaincluding in you know quote-unquotedeveloped countries uh there's still avery significant cohort of patients thatgo blind legally blind and then you knowabsolute blindness I can't even tell ifthe lights are on in the room uh so it'sit's it's it's devastating it'sInsidious it's hard to detect earlyum and so glaucoma's still a tough oneeven with all of the treatments that wehave okay so get your pressures checkedfolks and if you are prescribed dropstake your dropsI hear about patients not taking theirdrops which to me just seems likebaffling but I guess having to dosomething day in and day out is it canbe Troublesome enough that unless peopleare losing their Vision very quickly orthey are very afraid of losing theirVision sometimes they just neglect totake them it's hard it's hard forglaucoma eye drops it's hard for takingyour blood pressure medication it's hardfor a lot of medicines you know ifyou're if you're taking a medicine whereyou don't feel better you know if youhave a headache and you take an aspirinor Tylenol or an ibuprofen uh you knowyou feel better you feel reinforced goshtaking that pill made sense right but ifyou're using an eye drop that like heythis is going to protect you for thenext 20 years from losing your visionbut you don't notice every day thatanything's better and by the way the eyedrops could be a little irritating maybeit stings a little for a minute or twoand you put it in your eye some peopleare even less tolerant of the eye dropsit's hard to feel motivated every dayand we know that we call that compliancewe know that it's very hard for patientsto stay compliant with prescribedmedications where they don't feel ornotice a difference in a daily wayI realize that we can't stop aging"

            "text": "yetum but right now you can't stop agingand age is a risk factor for glaucoma myunderstanding is so is smoking or vapingnicotineand so is alcoholand by that reasoning should peoplestrive to drink less and smoke lessincluding vaping nicotine less if theyare concerned about glaucoma yeah andnot just glaucoma macular degenerationactually macular degeneration has acouple major risk factors maculardegeneration aging just like withglaucoma major risk factorsmoking including exposure to secondhandsmoke major risk factor for maculardegeneration and for the progression andvision loss potentially associated withmacular degeneration in the case ofmacular degeneration there's also acouple of genes that we've sequenced thehuman genome and there's a couple ofgenes associated with magnet generationtwothat's less true for your typicalrun-of-the-mill adult Kuma there aregenes for the Pediatric and infantileforms of glaucoma uh so yeah smoking ahundred percent including vaping uh it'sa No-No for your eyes just like it's aNo-No for the rest of your body and uhit's tough as the eye doctor to havethese conversations with patientsbecause you kind of feel like well youknow they must know it already and I'mtrying to be the good guy in the roomwith the patient convince them to usetheir other medications but it's it'simportant for us also as Eye CareProviders to reinforce the message withour patients a smoking terrible idea uhfor maca degeneration also for glaucomayou know glaucoma is interesting becausethe optic nerve where it degenerateskind of right at the head of the opticnerve where it exits the eye it's whatwe call a watershed Zone it's kind of anedge of two blood vessel supplies and ifeither of those blood vessels suppliesare a little bit short on blood oroxygen supply to that optic nerve headyour glaucoma is going to get worse youroptic nerve is going to be under fed andthat's going to worsen this degenerativeprocess just by not having all the rightnutrients and oxygen so the other thingis that especially for glaucomaeverything that we talk about for beingheart healthyfor the rest of our body is is almostcertainly true for glaucoma and so Ialso always counsel glaucoma patientsit's not just no smoking but eat healthyhave a multivitamin uh get some exerciseall those things that are good for yourcardiovascular system are going to begood for your eyes in general and inparticular if you have glaucoma or atrisk high risk for glaucoma I realizethat smoking or vaping are problematicfor glaucoma and for maculardegeneration but we can't have aconversation about glaucoma without atleast mentioning cannabis I did anentire episode about cannabis whichtouched on some of the real dangers ofvery high THC concentration cannabisthis lost me a fewum followers I'm sure no problem becausewhat was important was to convey thefact that the Cannabis that's out therenowadays comes in a variety of differentstrains and ratios of THC to CBD there'ssome severe risks of high THC especiallyin young males although not always thepoint being that there are and I want tobe very clear about this because forwhatever reason cannabis gets peoplereally up in arms they always say it'snot as bad as alcohol but guess what wedid an entire episode about alcohol andthere the message is very clear zero isbetter than any and two a week isprobably the limit and if you're analcoholic zero is the rule sowith cannabis it's clear by my read ofthe data that it can lower eye pressurewhich may undermine the progression ofglaucoma somewhat but if people aresmoking that cannabis is it thereforegoing to offset any gain that one wouldget from that cannabis and then how doesone account for the potentiallyproblematic aspects of very high THCcannabis yeah it's a great question andthe truth is is that in most patientscannabis will lower the eye pressure theproblem is is it really only lowers thateye pressure During the period thatyou're high from the Cannabis and thesecond problem is that smoking versionof getting that cannabis into yoursystem the smoking is bad for your lungsby the way the smoke from Cannabis orfrom cigarettes is also terrible foryour dry eyes it causes inflammation itdries out your eyes so it's also verybad from that perspective now so the theproblem with cannabis is not that itdoesn't work to lower the price we wantto lower the pressure that's great theproblem with cannabis is that it's notrealistic for most of our patientsto prescribe could you go out and behigh from Cannabis 24 hours a day sevendays a week for the next 20 years I'msure some people have tried andsucceededum but right that's not practical formost people and certainly for youngpeople it could be really especiallyproblematic yeah I should say absolutelyso so I recommend not taking thatapproach but that said I I'm definitelynot a decryer of it and now that thereare edible forms I certainly havepatients who are using it in aresponsible way uh especially edibleforms and uh and in select cases likethat could make the difference for themhelping to keep the pressure down andI'll say for example you know it turnsout you've talked a lot over the lastcouple years about diurnal curves andcircadian rhythms it turns out that oureye pressure also undergoes a circadianrhythm and it's actually highest atnight while we're sleeping kind of peaksin those early morning hours then hits alow throughout the early day and thenkind of rises again throughout theafternoon into the evening and we have alot of patients who they come into theirClinic visit their eye pressure looksnormal but it's actually quite a bithigher when they're at home and thatcould explain some fraction of what wecall normal pressure glaucoma it justlooks normal during the day it'sactually high at night and so inparticular some patients I certainlyhave some patients who are using theseproducts like let's say before bed andif it's controlling their eye pressureat night while they're asleep when theeye pressure would have been the highestit may confer some protective advantageover time but that said again like formost patients it's not going to be theprimary approach I'm most excited aboutthe idea ofyou know Laboratories or companiesfiguring out whichthe compounds Within These cannabinoidsthey're called within these products areactually responsible for lowering theeye pressure and could we get like amore potent eye specificlong-acting drug that's basicallyderived from the concept of cannabis butworks better and is more compatible withnot bringing along all the other adverseelements that can come with cannabis useyou mentioned the Circadian rhythm and"

thoughts onthe fact that the neural retina is infact neural and it's part of the brainand we are hearing an increasing amountof positive chatter about the use ofImaging the eye and the retina directlyas a way to detect other forms ofneurodegeneration for those that arelistening or for watchingum you know I'm putting my hands up inkind of C shape at the back of your eyeis lined with these with this three celllayer thick thing that is the neuralretina which are really pieces of brainthat connect to the rest of the brainand because it resides in the eyes andoutside the cranial Vault people likeyouskilled clinicians with the appropriatetools can look into the eye and see thebrain directly without having to cutthrough the skulland my understanding is that more andmore ophthalmologists are seeingcases where degeneration of the retinais correlated with degeneration ofstructures deeper in the brain makingImaging of the neural retina perhaps oneof the best diagnostic tools forpredicting and tracking the progressionof Alzheimer's and other forms ofneurodegeneration do I have that rightyeah absolutely actually this is a superexciting area you know we we have thislong-standing sang in Ophthalmology thatthe eye is a window to the brain theeyes of window to the soul of course isa log standing sang right and and itturns out that you know in Alzheimer'sdisease as an example you know we reallytalk a lot about the degeneration ofbasal forebrain cholinergic neurons thatare leading to the cognitive deficits inAlzheimer's disease but it turns outthat there is also some degenerationthroughout other areas of the brainincluding the retina and since we havesuch a relatively easy time Imaging theretina you can go into your doctor'soffice and get a quick little sort oflaser scan of the retina a picture ofthe ratna compared to like going througha full MRI processor for your brainand we can detect the degeneration ofthe retina and optic nerve associatedwith Alzheimer's disease it looks likethe same thing is happening inParkinson's disease in Ms now one of theissues is that in a lot of thesedegenerative diseases were able todetect the difference in the retina butwere not necessarily able to say hey ifwe see this in the retina it's multiplesclerosis but if we see that in theretina it's Alzheimer's disease so theremay not be there may be good sensitivityto detecting the disease and tofollowing whether your diseases yourbrain disease is getting worse but theremay not be very good specificitydifferentiating the different diseasesand I say that with a very big asteriskat the end of that sentence becausethere's actually amazingly cool new dataone of our colleagues who you know Alfdubrahas helped revolutionize a new way ofImaging the retina that's giving us nowcellular resolution and even subcellularresolution seeing things smaller thanthe sizes of cells inside our retina andrecently in one of his projects he'steamed up with another one of ourfaculty Heather Moss she's aneuro-ophthalmologist so she reallyspecializes clinically in the eye brainconnection and her research focuses onthat and together they made actually anamazing recent discovery of veryspecialized unusual novel structuresthat they can detect in the retina ofpatients with multiple sclerosis andwhether these kinds of discoveries orother similar kinds of discoveries aregoing to lead to kind of a a whole newgeneration of biomarkers which are waysof measuring disease diagnosing who hasthe disease figuring out who's gettingworse from the disease figuring outwho's responding to therapies that we'retrying to use to treat the diseases thisis a very exciting area and this reallytouches on what we're all hoping is thefuture of of eye care as well as therest of medicine and that's that'sPrecision medicine but also what we callPrecision Health we really want to notjust figure out what drug treatment togive this patient versus that treatmentbut

    "episode_summary": "In this episode, my guest is Jeffrey Goldberg, MD, PhD, professor and chair of the department of ophthalmology at the Byers Eye Institute at Stanford University. His clinical and research efforts focus on retinal and optic nerve diseases such as glaucoma and discovering stem cell and nanotechnology treatments to cure blindness. We discuss how to maintain and improve eye health throughout life, the advantages and disadvantages of corrective lenses, including if you should wear \u201creaders,\u201d the use and risks of contact lenses, considerations for LASIK eye surgery, floaters, dry eye, the importance of sunlight and UV protection and specific exercises to improve eye and vision health. Dr. Goldberg also explains age-related conditions: cataracts, glaucoma, macular degeneration and diabetic retinopathy; and the behavioral and supplementation-based, prescription and surgical tools used to promote eye health. This episode provides essential tools for listeners of any age and background to maintain eye health and offset vision loss.\nFor the full show notes, visit hubermanlab.com.\nThank you to our sponsors\nAG1 (Athletic Greens): https://athleticgreens.com/huberman\nLMNT: https://drinklmnt.com/huberman\nWaking Up: https://www.wakingup.com/huberman\nMomentous: https://www.livemomentous.com/huberman"
