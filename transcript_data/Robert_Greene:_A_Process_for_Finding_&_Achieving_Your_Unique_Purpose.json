life eventsperhaps can cue us to what that purposeis for each of us well thank you forthat that marvelous introduction I'malmost blushing that's that's fantasticstory um well you know being a humanbeing is not easy as opposed to ananimal because we're born and nobodygives us like a direction our parentsmight be a little bit our collegeteachers Etc mentors but generally we'reon our own and it's a very verydifficult process you wake up in themorning and you don't really know whatyou're what you can do you could choose12 different paths it can be veryconfusing and very overwhelming when youfind that sense of purpose when you findwhat I call your life's task everythinghas a direction everything has a purposeyour energy is concentrated it's notlike you're just going down a singlenarrow pathway it's not like lifebecomes boring and it's just aboutdiscipline and solving problems it'sactually the most exciting thing thatcan ever happen to you because you neverhave that lost feeling you wake up inthe morning and you go yeah this is whatI need to accomplish people come at youwith all kinds of distractions andboring and irritating things you're ableto cut it out it's just the mostmarvelous piece of internal radar thatyou can have so I genuinely wish thateverybody can find that that kind ofinternal radar and so it's not easy andI understand that there's no likeinstant formula because we're all aboutinstant formulas it's difficult and Iwant you to know that so it's not likeRobert can give me the answer in threeminutes no I can't but there's a processinvolved it's not it's not you know amystery you can follow a very singularprocess and the idea is you're weretalking aboutchildhood the way I like to frame it iswhen you were born you are a phenomenonyou are unique your DNA has neveroccurred in the history of the universegoing back billions of years it willnever occur in the future your lifeexperien with your parents andeverything that you experienc in yourearly years going on up is unique it'syours you're one of a kind right so thatis your source of power to waste that isjust the worst thing you can do in yourlife and what what the power is isfinding that uniqueness what makes youyou and how you can mine that and howyou can go deep into it and use that tocreate a career path right and so I tellpeople when you're a child when you'refour or five or even younger you havewhat the great psychologist maslo calledimpulse voices they Little voices inyour head that say I love this I hatethat I like this food I don't like whenMommy moves this way I like when Daddycomes from from here you're very CEDinto who you are and what you like andwhat you don't like and these voiceskind of direct you in certain waysright and when you're very young theydirect you towards intellectual mentalPursuits as well and there's a book Irecommend for everybody uh it's HowardGardner's five frames of mind it'shelped me immensely the idea is he talksabout five forms ofintelligence our problem is we think ofintelligence as most intellectual butthere are many forms of intelligencethere's the intelligence that has to dowith words there's abstract intelligencethat has to do with patterns andMathematics there's kinetic intelligencethat has to do with the body there'ssocial intelligence he has five of themand the idea is your brain naturallyveers towards one of them it can Veertowards two of them that happens butgenerally one of them kind of dominatesright and it's like a grain in yourbrain that's going in a certaindirection ction you want to go with thatgrain and because that's where yourpower will lie so when you're young ifyou go back and think about when youwere four or five you you can maybe geta picture of some kind of direction orvoice inside of you that was impellingyou towards this I know for me it waswords from I can remember when I was sixyears old I was just obsessed with wordsjust the letters in Words almost like inalmost slightly schizophrenic way Iwould spell words backwards I would takethem apart I would do anagrams I lovepaland drums right so I had a thingabout words and language it's veryPrimal some people you know AlbertEinstein when he was four years old hisfather gave him a birthday gift of acompass and he was just mesmerized bythis Compass the idea that there areinvisible forces out there in the cosmosmoving this needle and he's obsessedwith the idea of invisible forces SteveJobs when he was like seven or eight ormaybe younger in Berling game Californiahis father they passed by a store withde technological devices in the windowand he was just hypnotized by the designof those devices and the glass tubes andeverything so he wanted to go in thatdirection you know Tiger Woods saw hisfather hitting golf balls in the garageand he was just like screaming with joyhe had to he had to do that right youknow I can give you a million differentexamples of this of course these arepeople who are famous obviously we cango back and find that it's easier butwhat happens to you and please cut meoff if I'm going on too long no pleasecontinue please what happens to you isyou're seven now you're getting olderand you're starting to not hear thatvoice anymore you're hearing the voiceof your teachers telling you you're notgood at this field you need to getbetter at math you know you shouldn't beinterested in these sports or anythingyou should be going this dire yourparents are starting to tell you this isthe career they want for the directionthey want you to go in rightyou start hearing that more than yourown voice and as you get older it getsworse and worse and worse then whenyou're a teenager it's all about whatother people are doing your peers what'scool what's not cool you know and thatkind of is more so all of these noiseenters your brain and you can't hearthat anymore you don't know who you areand so you go tocollege you kind of maybe choose a amajor that seems practical that yourparents want you to to go into maybe youkind of wander around you're not sureand then you enter the work worldwithout that inner radar that I'mtalking about and you brother you'relost right where should I go well I needto make money right and so you make achoice based on the need to make a lotof money some not everyone but somepeople do that and I understand thatneed we all need to make a living butthat can set you off on a very bad pathbecause you're not connected emotionallythe thing is when you figure out thatPrimal inclination that grain that'sinside of you then you have the theenergy to to do to be disciplined to gothrough boring tasks to learn you learnat a faster rate because you'reemotionally engaged when you'reemotionally engaged in a subject thebrain learns twice three times fourtimes as fast as when you're not Ialways give the example in college Istudied foreign languages which was kindof a passion of mine for three or fouryears I studied French and then I wentto Paris and I couldn't speak a word itwas it was useless because it didn'tteach me anything practical right I wastotally confused and then but I was inParis and I and I loved it and I wantedto live there right and I had agirlfriend and I needed to speak Frenchto her and I can tell you in one month Ilearned more than those four years ofUniversity because I wanted to because Iwas engaged my emotions were there itwas like I had to survive to learnFrench whereas so most of us we don'thave a need really to learn this subjectWe're Half we're paying half attentionbut when you find that thing that reallyconnects to you you're paying deepattention your emotions are engagedyou're learning at a much faster rateokay and so the thing is how do you findthat when you're older when you're 21 II I give people a lot of help and it'susually not so difficult we can gothrough that process it gets harder whenyou're 30 and you've been wanderingaround but it's not impossible I didn'treally start find my exact path until Iwas 38 39 to be honest so there's hopewhen you get 40 and you get 50 gets moreand more difficult right and it's verysad if you wasted that seed ofuniqueness that I'm talking about and Itell people there are ways of going backand we go through a process likearchaeology we have to dig and dig anddig and find those bones from yourchildhood that indicated what you weremeant to do do but when you find yourlife's task everything opens up itdoesn't mean you figured out okay I'vegot to aim for this particular job whenI'm 28 that's not how it works it givesyou a sense of direction you can trydifferent things you can experiment youcan have fun when you're in your 20syou're going to learn you're going tolearn skills but it gives you an overallframework instead of whoa all thisconfusion this chaos social media theinternet I could go here here hereyou're lost at C it gives you a veryimportant sense of directionCompass as you described this I I havethis image of um you know you mentioned"

visceral yeahand the actions are actions they're ofthe body ultimately right um one has todraw speak write books Etc um to totransmute that excitement into somethingreal for people that are not asintellectually tuned but maybe arekinesthetically tuned for instance um Ican only wonder what that's like uh I'mnot completely uncoordinated but I don'tthink I have a kinesthetic Attunement uhor frame of mind but I for instance umhad a podcast listener mention that theythink in feels that they literallyexperience thought as a Ser as sort of apatchwork of of bodily Sensations rightand that thought for them is not of thestuff from the neck up but only from theneck down which to me was reallyintriguingand so I only rais this because um therehave to be a as you point out there's aninfinite number of different sort of umorientations based on our unique DNA andexperience but what do youthink explains why these particularseeds or uh as you point out like thethe the direction that the grain runs inthe brain I mean it's it's partiallygoing to be nature it's going to be DNAsure um but we we're talking about thisas if there's some exciting or ainspiring or Delight ful thing thatcaptures us can it be the other way toocan it be um you know one has a badexperience as a child in an intellectualenvironment and then decides you knowI'm I'm going in the D things of thebody feel good if things of the mind ofintellect feels bad and does it matterwhether or not we are drawn to ourPurpose By recognizing what we love orwhat we hate um or are both useful ohthey're both very very usefulum you know a lot of intelligence is isnot is non-verbal we think in terms ofimages we're we're very much infected bythe emotions of other people so I knowfor instance uh my mother is very veryinterested in history she's obsessedwith history and I probably absorbed herinterest in history I don't thinkthere's a genetic a gene for thatinterest you know so you're you're goingto absorb things from your parents aswell so it's not alljust genetic but yeah what you hate willpay a big have a big thing but theproblem with doing that is if you gointo a direction and you're in you're inelementary school Etc and they force youto learn math and you hate it what ittends to do is it turns you off fromlearning in general you think I don'twant to I don't want to I don't want tobe disciplined I don't want to gothrough anything because it's painfuldoesn't lead anywhere it's not mefrustration it turns you off fromlearning in general so it's it's reallyreally important for a child to have thelove experience as early as possible sothat they can know what they hate andwhy they hate it right and then they canRebel and they can go into that field asopposed to I hate learning I hatediscipline I hate studying I hate tryingthings over and over again if you'rekinesthetically oriented and you know apart of me I understand that because Ilove sports is you have to you have topractice it's going to take a lot ofit's not you're not going to instantlybe good at something right and that'sgoing to require a love of it right butif your math experience CU I hatelearning you're not it's going totransfer to sports you're going to hatediscipline in general so it's veryimportant for parents to let that childhave at least glimmers of that lovemoment I know for me when I um finishedcollege and I entered the work world Ihad to get a job I got worked injournalism I hated it I hated workingfor other people I hated office politicsI hated all the egos I hated thesmarminess I hated the lack of qualityit was all just about you know makingmoney and getting things out there andthen I worked in Hollywood I hatedHollywood I hated working in Hollywoodthat formed me very much made me go inthe direction that I went in but onlyfrom the basis of I knew that I wantedto be a writer so you know that's veryimportant that it's not just hate it canform you but there also has to be thatpositive deep emotional love ofsomething that also is grounded in youin some way what you just said reallyhighlights the fact that energy andmotivation can come from either eitherpressure you know desire for somethingor desire to get away from something andum earlier when you were talking aboutum how we are so much more engaged anddriven toward things that stir usemotionally and and actually we knowbased on the the neurosciences you knowtoo I'm sure that um only by the releaseof certain neurochemicals in the brainand body would our brain have any reasonto change right if you don't feelagitation and you can do everything thatyou're trying to do of course your brainwouldn't change like why would it rightthat agitation is a is a signature ofthe neurochemicals that are saying heysomething's

mean we are differentpeople before and after puberty hormonesthat are suddenly raging the hormonesare there and it's not just changes inhow we view the world but changes in howthe World Views us and not just throughthe lens of sexuality but also so umexpectation of what we are capable ofwhat we are responsible for or notresponsible for our learning capacity Imean puberty is like this you know it'salso the most rapid stage of Aging inour entire lifespan those kids that gohome for summer and then come back likeshaving you know I was sort of a late Iwasn't a late bloomer but I had a longprotracted puberty but I remember thosekids I'm sure we we all remember thosekids um everything changes and so Ithink prior to puberty these seeds asyou described them of of delight or ofresistance to things think they areunadulterated they're not contaminatedby the voices and expectations of othersand so I can see the challenge ofreaching back to those as an adult um Iwonder if this relates to um somethingthat I've heard you talk about beforealthough perhaps not as much as some ofthe other topics you've discussedpublicly which is um the real versus thefalse Sublime oh um could you perhapsjust Define for us what Sublime reallyis what a Sublime experience is and andthe distinction between real and falsewow Sublime experiences because I I feellike this relates to finding that seedright it's it's about finding authenticseeds of within us as opposed to whenemotions can be distracting andmisleading wow I never thought I nevermade that connection and it's the bookthat I'm writing right now so thank youfor that I have to think about that I'mactually I'm writing a book on thesublime and um I have several ways ofkind of illustrating I generally like touse a metaphor and the metaphor is thatbeing a human being being a social humanbeing living in a particular culturemeans that you live inside of a circleand that Circle of that time are theconventions of thinking of ideas thatare acceptable of behavior that isacceptable this is where you where youcan go mentally where you can gophysically you know all the codes andconventions sothat Circle for ancient Egypt and for21st century America they're obviouslyvery different but it's the same Circleit's the same limiting factor you're notsupposed to go outside of it these arethoughts experiences Behavior you're notsupposed to do the sublime is what liesjust outside that Circle um the wordsublime comes from on the threshold ofit's like here's a door and the sublimeis literally at the threshold of thedoor you're looking out into somethingelse right and the quintessentialSublime experience is a near-deathexperience you're standing on the on thedoorway the threshold of death itselfright and so in my book I'm illustratingthe different kinds of sublimeexperiences that you can have inrelation to the cosmos in the relationto thinking about being alive just beingalive is the strangest sensation you canpossibly have I have I know that veryperson personally after my stroke I gointo childhood chapter on childhood andhow Sublime your own childhood was I gointo animals relation to animals I gohave a chapter about the brain chapterabout love I'm working right now on achapter about history okay but what I'mtrying to say is the human brain iswired for these experiences is wired fortranscendental experiences that take usout of the narrow little realm that welive in because we're aware of our deathas the only animal truly conscious ofits own mortality and it frightens thehell out of us and the idea that we cansee something larger than than just thethe the banal parts of our life is adoorway that op allows us to kind oftranscend the moment to feel connectedto something larger to feel connected tosome power in the cosmos to Evolutionitself right and so we're wired for thatand I'm writing a chapter now about40,000 years ago at the moment where Ithink the sublime was born is a storythat I'm trying to illustrate right nowwith our upper Paleolithicancestors so it's deep inside of us weneed it we have to have it in the 21stcentury we have very few avenues for itany real Avenues religion used to be themain kind of way of accessing this andso because it's so deep we reach forfalse forms of the sublime that give usthe sense that we're we're transcendingbut it's not at all because Sublime hasto come from within it's an experiencethat you have that you're generating inyour own mind and your own experiencethe false Sublime comes from outside itcomes from drugs it comes from alcoholit comes from shopping it comes fromonline rage it comes from joining acause and just getting out all youraggression and violence right it comesfrom causes it comes fromaddictions okay it giv you a sense itcalms you down and makes you feel likethere's something else going on in lifebesides your job that you're you're sickof but it's not real it's not lastingit's false it's an illusion it's notbased on anything real it's notconnecting to that deep part of humannature that's wired for theseexperiences so what happens is you haveto have more and more and more and moreof it you have to have you know more ofthis rush you need more of the drug youneed more of the alcohol you need moreof the sex you need more of the hornit's never going to satisfy you but thereal Sublime you don't have that feelingit's like it's transformative once youfeel it it lasts for you for the rest ofyour life it's what maslo again called apeak experience so that's the differencebetween the faults and the real SublimeI haven't quite connected it to what youwere saying but if I think about it Ithink you're on something veryinteresting I mean maybe the connectionI was trying to draw was uh doesn't holdbut yeah for meum those early experiences of seeingthings that just delighted me in a waythat felt like that not only is well thethe the thought process was a long timeago when something like oh my goodness Ican't believe this exists this is socool this is the coolest thing and soclearly create an activation statewithin me but then there was also athought and a feeling of again a lotthis is or pre preverbal it's not trulypreverbal I could speak at that age butit was um that's of me and I'm of itright there's a connection there andthen it was there's something to doabout this the activation State createdin the body was you know I I need tolearn more about this I need to tellpeople about this I need to think aboutthis I need more examples of this andsee whether or not they're all like thisyou know etc etc um so certainly itmeets some of the criteria of a Sublimeexperience definitely and I knew againwhen I was in graduate school and againwhen I was this young Professor about totransition to tenure that I knew it wasgoing going to do something different itwas as if I was on the threshold ofsomething but I didn't know what thatnext thing was but I could trust itbecause of that early experience ofknowing that's the threat like like I'man amphibian this is my environment andyou're an amphibian too right and we'redifferent amphibians but you know we'regoing to be amphibians together rightand then and there's a permanence to itthat it does seem to transcend time youI'm obsessed with time perception so Ihave to be careful not to go off on atangent about that but the human brain'sability to F slice or macro slice timeis incredible and and it's been said ofum not just addictions but alsointeractions with toxic people that theymurder time that that humans have a Ithink it was young I I'll look it up butum one of the great psychologists saidsomething to the extent that umaddictive behaviors thought patternssubstances are humans attempts to murdertime so that they don't have to addresstheir mortality yeah and that's alwaysmade a lot of sense to me yeah we saykill time is our expression kill timethrough passive engagement but also killtime through um trying to getoverwhelmed or overtaken by anexperience or a substance as opposed towhen you're truly connected you havethat sense offlow and 3 hours can pass by and you'renot even aware of it so time is atotally subjective experience it can beextremely slow and tedious and you feelvery depressed or it can pass by butthat passes by without you even noticingit and it's a wondrous experience youknow when I'm deep in my writing I'm notaware of the time passing I'm soinvolved I'm so immersed it's a deeplydeeply pleasurable experience of time itis Sublime and yeah so I agree with youI think your distinction is veryinteresting you know I'm eagerlyawaiting your your next book but wewon't rush you well I I I'm I'm soimmersed in it that I could I could talkfor hours because I also have a chapterin there about what I call thedayon which is like that voice inside ofyou that speaks to you and I'm writing awhole chapter about how Sublime that iswhen you connect to that voice so youare spoton there is something very muchconnected to Mastery in this book butit's the next chapter that I'm writingfantastic can't wait I can't wait I'dlike to shift slightly to a topic that"

            "text": "you've written extensively about whichis power um and not just power but alsoseduction which you've writtenextensively about and of course you'vewritten about finding one's purpose sotell me if the framework that I've justgiven myself Liberty to create is anaccurate one and if it's not I I'mhoping that um it's not in perhaps someinteresting ways so to me you talk aboutand we will talk about power as as aresource it's it's something that umit's there as a resource it could beused or not used um and I think ofSeduction as one form of exchangebetween an individual so there's a verbassociated with seduction power I'mthinking of more as a noun in thiscontext you're the word guy um and thenyou know purpose is uh is really aboutfinding like to what end or ends one isgoing to um devote power seduction andthe other forces that allow human beingsto interact with each other in the worldum but power as a resource that can beexpressed in different ways and accessedin different ways maybe we could justexplore that a little bit because youknow when we hear the word power I thinka lot of people kind of brace themselveslike here we go someone's going to tryand have power over me this is aboutmanipulation and so on and so forth butI learned pretty early on that everyevery career Endeavor there there arepower dynamics there's Mentor menteethey teachers and their students andboth have power um in inter in romanticrelationships there's a power exchangethere are yeses and their NOS there aremaybe there are um uh covert and overtcontracts yeah I'll do this because Iwant to right you'll do this because youwant to great sounds great overtcontract they're also covert contractswell I don't feel safe doing that sowhat I'll do is I'll take some somethingon through from the interaction thatyou're not aware of so that I can sortof um ease my sense of danger and makegive myself the illusion of feeling safeand all sorts of kind of complicatedhuman dynamics that have to do with ushaving this forbrain thing that can doall of that gymnastics so maybe we couldstart very simply by just saying youknow how would you define power in termsof its uh functional definition like inin in interpersonal relations and thenwhy do you thinkpower is so essential to allrelationships that's really what I'dlike to get to why is it so essentialwhy couldn't it be something else wellthe way I Define po is I try and take itaway from that kind of negative contextthat most people have and that you thatyou brought up and I bring it tosomething very primitive and very Primalthe way the human being is wired thefeeling that we have no control over ourenvironment and in the earliest periodit was literally over our environmentand wild animals and nature and and theclimate Etc but now the sense that youhave no control over your career overyour children over your parents isdeeply deeply am miserating and itcompels us to act in certain ways eitherattempts to find positive ways of poweror doing what you call covert ways ofgetting power you know passiveaggressive traditionally passiveaggressive means so it's deeply wired inUS to want a degree of control over theimmediate environment and immediateevents we can never have completecontrol and the idea of having completecontrol is nonsense and it wouldactually be very ugly because you want adegree of Letting Go and lettingcircumstances come to you etcetc so the sense of you you you want tofeel like with other people andrelationships that you can influencethem that you can move them in a certaindirection either to get you to love youand treat you better or either to stopannoying irritating behaviors or eitherto you know wake up and and find and andand do productive activity if it's yourchildren Etc you want to have theability to influence people to move themin a certain direction either in yourinterest or in their interest right andonce you have that need and every singlehuman being ever who's ever lived hasthat need and we often don't Recrecognize it because we're embarrassedby it we're embarrassed by our desirefor power for our need to control everyhuman being has it right and it's noteasy because human beings arecomplicated they don't if you say dothis and you're talking to your sonhe'll do the opposite or he'll dosomething else you can't just forcepeople in a direction right by beingovert and telling them this is what youneed to do you create resentment youcreate an enemy they may they may sayyes yes daddy yes husband I'll do whatyou say but they're you they're they'regoing to resist you deep down insideright so people are tricky they wearmasks they pretend to say one thing andthey do another they have their egos andyou inadvertently wound their egos ortrip them in some way and they react ina way that you don't expect and so poweris this kind of invisible realm thatenvelops Society where people arecontinually battling each other andstruggling in it but no one is liketalking about it no one's being overtabout it no one's saying this is exactlywhat I'm trying to do and so when youenter the social world in the careerworld you're not expecting these battlesyou don't know no one's taught you noone's trained you your parents don'ttrain you nobody trains you and you makemistakes and you realize how politicalpeople are if you're a Sharky characterand there there's a certain percentageof them you realize wow I can deceivepeople I can manipulate them I can getwhat I want I can pretend to love themand they'll they'll fall for me and Ican do all this other stuff but for mostof us the 95% of us who aren't sharksand I'm I'm including myself in thatcategory it's it's it's very verydisturbing to suddenly enter that worldand see all of that invisible powergames on that's no one's given you anyadvice for helped you and so take it outof the realm of it's just about tryingto dominate the world and manipulate andexploit and and abuseit's something inside of you you havethis need and your suppression of itwill only make you come out in passiveways and you won't be able to controlcertain things if you want to movepeople if you want them to follow yourideas if you want them to be morealigned with your politics or your ideasyou have to be subtle you have to learnpsychology you have to learn certainaspects of how to almost move peoplewithout them realizing in in certaindirections which is like The Art ofSeduction and if you're not interestedin that if you're just going to tellpeople what you think and what you'regoing to do that means you're notinterested in Practical action you'renot interested in results you're justinterested in inventing your ownfrustrations or your own anger solearning the subtle little dynamics ofpower is extremely essential becausewe're a social animal it doesn't meanthat you're going to get dirty thatyou're going to suddenly go out thereand manipulate the out of people most ofthe 48 Laws of Power is about defensebut how to defend yourself from theSharks about there how to defendyourself from making classic mistakeslike outshining the master like talkingtoo much like arguing with peopleinstead of demonstrating your ideas onand on and on it's not an ugly thing itactually makes you a better socialindividual so that's how I I like toframe it it's very interesting I Ithink as a young guy growing up it wasso important to me um to know where Ifit in with my friend group um and Ididn't think of it so much as ahierarchy um nor when I was in myacademic studies did I think of it as ahierarchy even though it was clearly wasright um so much as it the goal was tofigure out where was my unique slot thatI could um do the most good for myselfand others right of finding my spot um Idon't want to say on a shelf CU thatgives an image of something vertical butyou know in the let's make it lateral alateral arrangement of different peoplewith different strengths different lifepurposes trying to figure them out youknow where where should I be in order toexpress that and also feel connected toothers and um and in order to do that Idid have to I realize now based on youranswer I did have to figure out um youknow who's trying to have power overwho's pretending that they don't wantpower but is actually exerting power umyou know these sorts of things andthere's an incredible piece that comesfrom knowing that one is in the correctPlace both profession interpersonally inrelation to oneself but also in thecontext of one's peer peer group justkind of yeah this is where I belongbecause trying to gain power when one istrying to move to a position that isn'tright for them or in a way that isn'tright for them just seems soenergetically costly yeah seems like awaste of a life frankly right right youknow trying to gather resources simplyto to have them to give the illusion ofpower but then being afraid of losingthem just sounds like a recipe for formisery as you pointed out you knowwhereas figuring out where am I mostpowerful in the benevolent sense of theword that that that seems like a good agood Pursuit well it's connecting up toto Mastery again and finding your life'spurpose you know I I I knew when I wasyoung that I couldn't exert physicalpowerbecause I was a skinny little runt and Iwas I wasn't bullied but people wouldkind of pick on me etc etc so I veeredtowards intellectual Pursuits where Icould have power and in the end you knowyou might have been a jock and you mighthave done well in high school but hahaLook at me now I'm not saying that it'sa beautiful thing that that's but that'spart of human nature the desire toactually you know prove yourself andfind that Niche that you that you belongto so you don't have that kind of humthat sense ofinferiority which Alfred Adler thepsychologist describes very eloquentlyso a lot of it is kind of compensatingwhen you're a child for things that areyour weaknesses and finding what you'reso good at that you do have that powerand people can't bully you right and youyou're you're like now a famousneuroscientist whereas they're like whoknows what they're doing kind of thingso power definitely is connected in someway to that inner sense of what you weremeant to do and you feel it with thewith the ease and the connection thatcomes from it right so I can honestlysay that my dislike of working for otherpeople and office politics and egos Inow have a of an existence where I don'thave to deal with any of that and I'm soblessed and I wake up every morning andI pray to God thank God I I found thisbecause it's it's the perfect lifestylefor me yeah you're are can be accuratelyDes described as an intellectual Beastso it's um and which is like acompliment right um we hear the wordbeast and we think uh you know aFerocious Beast trying to harm othersbut I'm happy being a beast yeah youknow so I think finding where we can bea beast you know and and for some peoplethat's painting or or gardening orwhatever it might be um I think is againties back to the these issues of or thisquest of forMastery seduction is also a very loadedword right it's even more more uglier"

            "text": "than power because seduction rightseduction kind of drips with uh the ideathat somebody istricking someone else into doingsomething that they otherwise would notwant to do but seduction is both ourpropensity to do it and to have it doneto us is hardwired into our nervoussystem and has a lot to do with thehypothalamus and a bunch of other areasthat I won't Bor us with thenomenclature but um seduto me implies some sort of exchange Isuppose we could seduce ourselvesthrough denial or convincing ourselvesthat of of something but more often thannot when we talk about seduction we'retalking about an interaction between twoor more people so um what are some ofthe core principles of Seduction and andif you care to play um Anthropologist abit um and a neuroscientist I I wouldinvite that why do you think we haveneural circuits in our brain that allowus to seduce and beseduced well um I don't know how if ifI'm if I'm being kind of an armchairintellectual here but my my theory issome of it has to go back to social umevents long in our prehistory which haveto do withtaboos and Society was initially kind oforganized by a series of taboos rightmost notably the taboo on incest andwhat happened is just not my theory it'sthe theory of the malanowski malanowskiis I pronounce it um that the moment ataboo enters the human brain like you'renot supposed to sleep with this womanthe desire arises inside of you toactually sleep with that woman the thethe sense of no the sense that this isprohibited stirs the desire stirs thecontrary impulses in humans and we canbe very um what's the word perversecreatures right so if you've ever triedto suppress a thought you realize thatit keeps coming up keeps coming up youcan't suppress it don't think of anelephant Andrews whatever you do don'tthink of an elephant you're thinking ofit because you can't help it right theidea that you're not supposed to desireof this person stirs that actual desireso I believe the sense of somethingbeing taboo and transgressive is theultimate kind of origin of our desirefor seduction but seduction involvesvulnerability it involves somebody getsinside somebody gets under our skinright and to do that we have to let themin so the person being seduced is insome ways to a degree complicit becauseif you just put up a wall and you saidno I I'm not going to be seduced nothingwill happen but you have a vulnerabilityyou're letting that person into yourpsyche Into Your Inner Space theParadigm for that is Early Childhood soFreud talks a lot about this so I don'tknow if people still believe in Freudanymore I certainly do okay absolutely agenius of both Psychology and Physiologywrong about a lot of things did a lot ofthings he shouldn't have done I let'sacknowledge that I think everyone wouldagree that sleeping with your patientsand being a cocaine addict bad ideas butat the same time he had an absolute likenear Supernatural levels of insight andBrilliance into human nature he sleepwith his patience I believe he did umbut if I just if I just threw that onhim without him doing it then you knowuh forgive me certainly had emotionalattachments to his patients that heshouldn't have had I don't know if heslept with them he very well might havebut his idea was that the child isseduced by the parent you're inextremely vulnerable position right yourlife depends on them and they'reseducing you with their energy you'reletting them in right and that kind ofcreates a pattern for the rest of yourlife and so for instance the feeling ofbeing carried by your father and justbeing taken around physically is a formof Seduction because you don't know whathe's going to do to you you're veryexcited you want that surprise right andto me it's related to the seduction of astory stories are very seducing to us wedon't know where they're taking us wedon't know what the next chapter is whatgoing to happen to this character or notthe surprise lowers our resistance andopens our mind up to what's going tohappen next is a form of Seduction fairytales the stories you were reading as achild your interactions with yourparents they're deeply deeply ingrainedin you you cannot be seduced unless youare vulnerable right and so I like toswitch it around and get out of thenegative connotations being vulnerableis actually a positive trait I think alot of people now in the world todaybecause things are so harsh and invasivethat people have become tooinvulnerable they don't want to letanything in right and this now infectstheir relationships with other peoplethey don't want to be influenced theythey want to be strong inside ofthemselves they're afraid of giving into the other person of surrendering totheir influence but it's actually adelightful feeling to surrender to thepower of another person and then reversethat charge and have them surrender toyour power so when I'm reading a writerand sometimes uh they completely seduceme like friederick nich is one of myfavorite writers I let go of everythingI let him enter my brain and I'mcompletely seduced I let him lead mealong but then I encounter writers thatI don't like at all I I'll mention oneyou know it's probably not a good thingbut step Pinker I don't like St StPinker I find him really annoying okayum but I force myself to try and find away to be seduced by him to let him intomy brain to see where he's coming fromto open myself to the possibility thathe could be correct so vulnerabilityletting people into your mental space isa form of intelligence it's a it's kindof an emotional and an intellectualintelligence and forgive me forinterrupting but I think it also impliesa level of confidence because empathy orallowing oneself to be vulnerable to thepoint where you're seduced by somethingum bydefinition if you're choosing to do ituh implies that you also have theconfidence that you can get back toyourself afterward right that you're notgoing to get lost in the circumstancesyou're not going to be hijacked to thepoint of no return right or in some waythat's detrimental to you so it it's umit I'm sound really nerdy here it's it'scinear with with confidence in many wayssure like take my mindand take it where you will because Iknow I can come back at any time rightright and the same thing in a physical sin a romantic sense right you're openingyourself up to the charm to the energyof the other person but if they startdisplaying dark energy and you see thatthey're abusive or something is wrongyou have the ability to retreat ah wellthere it gets tricky because very trickywell because the attachment systemswhich are also rooted in childhood umoften times can overwhelm one's abilityto recover oneself like I mean so I meanhow many if I had a dollar for everytime someone in that I knew in my lifesaying like you know I know they're badfor me but I just can't like we justcan't seem to disengage like that youhear about that all the time I mean yousee court cases about this that arepublic and you know you just go whydidn't they just walk away from oneanother well because once thoseattachment systems are locked in italmost becomes in a and heremetaphorically speaking like a parentchild relationship like you can'tsuddenly decide your parents weren'tyour parents simply because you knowbetter now right you are foreverstricken with the reality that they wereand they had an influence and I thinkthat that attachment system is um is ais a force that tugs pretty hard yeahand um a lot of women have written to mesince the Art of Seduction sort ofsaying that their boyfriend or husbandwas applying some of these tactics onthem and it was very painful and theywere kind of a little bit angry at mefor for it but then they kind ofrealized that they it wasn't they didn'tlearn it really from my book it wasalready kind of wired in them but thatreading about these tactics and thesestrategies actually helped them torecognize what their husband orboyfriend was doing to them themanipulation and the games that werebeing played do men write to you andtalk about the seductive adornments thatwomen have used to to um bring them intorelationship as well or are youtypically hearing from women I mostlyhear from women complaining about menand and and how they've abused them andhow they usedsome of these some of the strategies I Idon't deny have a slightly nefariousEdge to them because I didn't want towrite a book about Seduction Thatdoesn't have that taboo element becauseI say seduction involves the taboo and Ididn't want to I didn't want to censormyself but female to male seductionclearly also exists less of Iacknowledge that it's um less often isit physically abusive um but right Imean from an early age both boys andgirls men and women are coached bySociety on the sorts of uh seductivetactics and and adornments right I meaneverything from makeup perfumehairstyles cars watches jewelry umexpression power displays of any kind umI mean that stuff the world's filledwith that stuff yeah but men aregenerally kind of happy when a womanseduces them right they're unlessthey're after their money or somethinglike that which happens but generallythe sense you know I talk about this inin the first chapter about which I couldsay is the quintessential archetype ofthe female seductress the the kind ofhalf human half bird creature on a rocksinging so beautifully that you have tojump in the water and then they kill youand so the idea is that men want to letgo because men have to be so in controlso powerful they have to project thisimage they have a secret desire to letgo and be almost dominated by a verypowerful woman a lot of men have thatand I talk about some of the mostpowerful men in in history Julius CaesarMark Anthony um Joe dagio who all thesemen very masculine men who've fallen forvery feminine siren likee women and beencompletely dominated by them and theyactually kind of enjoy the processbecause it's like a sense of I can letgo I can enter this totally s sensualphysical world and it it's extremelypleasing it's like another realm outsideof my kind of cold masculworld you know so I don't really get mencomplaining too much about women who'veseduced them honestly it's usually theother wayaround I'd like to take a quick breakand thank our sponsor insid tracker"

elaborateon that um because as you weredescribing some of the seductive powerdynamics that ex IST a phrase that I'veheard before uh came to mind um that atfirst made me chuckle but then made methink um quite deeply about this issueof the relationship between sexual andpower dynamics which is this notion oftopping from the bottom you know if oneis giving someone else the impressionthat they are more powerful by virtue ofthe word giving they actually hold somepower right power is can be given ortaken but um often times uh seductiveexchanges and sexual exch exchanges andromantic exchanges in particular areabout both peopleuh buying into a ill a temporaryillusion let's pretend that you're incharge when actually I'm in charge okaybut I know that you think that you're incharge okay let's just pretend none ofthat exists and just do X right and Ithink this is another example of covertcontracts and it's one that actually canpotentially create a lot of problemspost Hawk right um but I think therelationship between sex romance andpower is an important area to explore inthe context of this well I wrote The Artof Seduction with the idea that it wasan art invented by women it was inventedby women who had no power essentiallysocially politically in any sense of theword in in in domesticallyright and but the one power that theycould that they could wield over a manwas through sexsome physical attraction and so theydevelop this art of kind of luring a maninto their world through varioustheatrical effects Cleopatra being kindof the archetype of this and then luringthe the powerful man into this world hehas the illusion that he's the onepursuing her but in fact she is the onecontrolling the dynamic so often timesthe person who appears to be the weakerone in the relationship who's not doingthe pursuing is actually inviting thepursuing is actually leading the otherperson on so there's a lot of kind ofappearance games going on and you cannever really figure out who exactly isin control of the dynamic because oneperson islike allowing the other person to leadthem on but the fact that you'reallowing them is a degree of power is adegree of control right so it's veryhard to figure out and sex and power andromantic relationships are very muchintertwined in US physically emotionallyneurologically you can't avoid it rightand so I think it's kind of dishonest tosay that that none of that exists thatit's like that there's some egalitarianParadise out of there when it it'sreally not wired in us for that kind ofrelationship there's a recent scientificpublication SL factoid that I want toshare with you in this context becauseI'd like your thoughts on it uh DavidAnderson who's a phenomenalneurobiologist he's been a guest on thispodcast before he's a professor atCaltech studies um basically thefunctions of the hypothalamus so okaythings like uh aggression mating and andthings of that sort um and does it so itin with great detail he's a virtuoso ofthe hypothalamus and he published apaper two years ago showing that indeedthere are neural circuits in the brainof animals and presumably in humans aswell that control sexual mountingBehavior but that there is actually aseparate circuit forpurely nonsexual mounting and physicalpower over that's expressed in animalsand anyone that's ever owned a dog andgone to the dog park will see same-sexmounting between dogs or mountingbetween dogs that has apparently um nosexual end point yeah and in exploringthis lit and some talking to David aboutit it's very clear that there are neuralcircuits um that have everything to dowith essentially one animal of a speciesgetting on top of the other animalusually from behind often timesscruffing or biting the back of the neckand saying I control you it's a it'soften done in a playful contextespecially between animals not alwaysaggressive but there's a certain elementof aggressive to it but essentially saysI decide whether or not you are mobileor not for this moment and that it andthis is very important I want toemphasize this this is a circuit that isentirely separate from all of thereflexes associated with sexual behaviorin males and females I find this to befascinating um and because we hear aboutpower over right and we hear about powerand we think about physical power overbut the idea that something as primitiveas mounting just like something asprimitive as biting or asstriking has its own unique set ofcircuits in the brain I thinksubstantiates every everything that youput in uh in your books about power andmaybe even seduction as well so as Ijust kind of toss that out there forconsideration I I I wonder um if youhave any Reflections on it if not umfeel free to just say I don't but ofcourse but to me this was a reallyimportant Discovery because I thinkeveryone looks at mounting behavior andsays oh that has to be sexual andsometimes it's oh I see what you meanbut but it's not that there's a thereseem to be a host of neural circuits inthe brain that are are really aboutdefining who's on top literally that hasnothing to do withsex yeah I'm sure that's true I've neverI've never I've never um read anythingabout that but I can say that um I wrotea chapter in in my new book about loveand that's a different thing than thanseduction and I was trying to come upwith an idea of love that does have anelement of equality that doesn't havethis power dynamic going on in it I lovethat and um you know kind of like theantithesis of my Art of Seduction whereI'm almost contradicting myself and Iwas going into the into the biology ofit and even into the physics of it sothere is a famous uh French biologistwhose Name Escapes me I'm sorry I can'tremember from the 20s and 30s um and hewas studyingparium and he found he was studying themyou know they they're in these ponds Etcand he said that there was these momentswhere these single celled organisms weresuddenly coupling they were all joiningtogether just one to one and they wereabsorbing the membrane of one inside theother and then they would like go andthen once one couple did that all theparium started joining up together thenthey would sink to the bottom of thepond and parium don't reproduce throughsex they reproduce through dividingthemselves right selfreproduction and so he was saying thatthe desire to couple to to to connect tosomeone so deeply where you absorb oneis absorbed in the other is biologicallywired into US goes back millions andmillions and millions of years and it'sa desire essentially a biological desirefor love right and it's an energy thatpermeates all all the it's it's not justabout power and hierarchyand that he was showing other creaturesthat had something similar going on andyou know in physics we talk aboutentanglement and we also talk about umyou know matter if matter isn't absorisn't um opposed by a lot of kineticenergy it joins together I meanparticles join together to form matteretc etc so there's something in theuniverse that's trying to connect thingsto each other so there's this this kindof energy that exists in the world wherewe have a deep need to connect tosomebody with outside of those powerdynamics right where there's a degree ofequality where we're drawn to each otherand we let go of the ego games we let goof the playing we kind of surmount ourown physiology our ownhypothalamus and we engage in this Icall it love Sublime and it involves thephysical part the sexual part is thetrigger for it because when you have sexwith someone your body is suddenlypermeable to their energy in a way thatyou cannot control it releases all kindsof of chemicals in the brain that arevery powerful and oftentimes that senseis too powerful and you react and you'reafraid of it and you pull back but ifyou don't react and you go further thenthe mind also becomes permeable to theother person and their energy and theirdesire and so thenit kind of creates a spiraling effectwhere the physical and the mentalconnection reaches this state that Icall love Sublime now it's an ideal itdoesn't really exist that much out therein the world today but there are storiesin history that illustrate it and Ibelieve that is a biological necessityfor us to feel a deep deep sense ofconnection we normally ascribe that toreligion to God Etc but I maintain theessence of love the model for for loveis between two human beings straight orhomosexual doesn't matter and thatfeeling of surmounting our own neurologyour own system and and entering thiszone is deeply deeply satisfying we allwant it and it has to involve letting goof the power dynamics letting andeverything being equal it's not that theother person is exactly like you yourecognize their difference but but asfar as being worthy of attention beingworthy andrespected you leave all that other stuffoutside so there is a Zone that'spossible that's outside this power denamthat we're talking about I'm excitedthat you're writing about this uh sothis is for your next book yeah I'm veryexcited I couldn't help but think ofsome of the parallels between what you"

            "text": "describe and what we're observingnowadays in the landscape of politicsand social dynamics where clearly umthey is no setting aside of egos peoplefeel both sides feel attacked everyonein between feels confused like why do Ihave to pick aide um and there seems tobe no hint of a future where people aresetting down their swords it which meansif we were to go with your earlierdefinition which I like a lot that umnobody feels safe enough to bevulnerable enough to um to allow theunion of of people to occur which isjust a way a way of rewarding you know abunch of other things um and not nearlyas eloquently as as you described it butif setting aside of power dynamics andmaking oneself vulnerable is is the keyto accessing love in the Romanticcontext surely but also in the umsocietal context I mean what are thechannels for that I mean I suppose thereis the argument not mine that everyoneshould just take a boatload ofpsychedelics and see theinterconnectedness of things but thatseems like an realistic route I I justdon't see that being you know um youknow 12th grade graduation um curriculumum nor do I think it would be healthy Ito be clear I think that you we'd end upwith a lot of expression of of problemsthere um but short of a magic substancethat could increase feelings of uhconnectedness among everyonesimultaneously um how are you going tosave Humanity Robert well um because I'mI'm concerned about young people inparticular with hookup culture withpornography etc etc it's kind ofrewiring the human brain and we'relosing what I was just describing and Isee aot particularly a lot of youngpeople and I don't blame them becausethey've grown up in a world that's verychaotic and very hostile could could Isay I think it's um and not to benitpicky here but I I love what you justsaid I think in my mind it's hi thingslike that are hijacking the hard wirringof the brain okay um and I'm just I'magain forgive me my the audience isprobably going can't really rewire thebrain like that so well I think we canexpand and rewire Upon Our hard wiringbut so much of what you you talk aboutin your books is about finding one'sEssence but then also what I love aboutyour books so much among many otherthings is that it's about that dancebetween the hard wiring and and thepossible of through effort so anywayforgive me for for being it's veryaccurate so yeah what how do you get usout of this well you're putting a bigburden on me I am but I think you're upto it you know um well I try to do it inthis chapter because I wanted to seducethe reader into the idea that this issomething extremely pleasurable andextremely healthy and the feeling ofbeing vulnerable is a very positiveattribute that will infect not just yourromantic relationships but will infectyou mentally so creative people areextremely vulnerable they're extremelyvulnerable to ideas they're extremelyvulnerable to the environment andclosing yourself off into your own egointo yourself so the chapter is calledEscape the Prison of the egoo and you'reyou're kind of trapped inside ofyourself and your own thoughts and yourown desires and it's like a prison it'senclosing you and you want to escapesomehow and you escape through drugs youescape through porn but it doesn't leadto actually escaping you want to be ableto let go of the self and get out ofthis this prison that you're in rightand so it's a desire that that we allhave and so I wanted to frame it as thisincredibly positive Dynamic that you canengage in and the ability to bevulnerable to other people to openyourself up and to say that yeah theymight hurt me but I'm strong enough totake it and if they hurt me I'll learnfrom it and I'll rebound and I knowthat's a bit naive on my part but I wantyou to at least have that feelingbecause a lot of young people write tome and they say I I can't fall in loveanymore I can't I don't like thatfeeling I it makes the loss of controlis too much you know and and a lot ofthat their behavior patterns are increating this sense of control which youcan have when you're locked inside ofyourself uh hence over indulgence inpornography yeah and masturbationEtc as a way to avoid the you know theunderstandable fear about interrelational Dynamics yeah yeah so youknow when you're young you're you'reidealistic at least a lot of youngpeople are and you have these dreams andthese hopes and to let go of thispossibility which is deeply pleasurableand deeply therapeutic to the humananimal as a social animal it's like thehighest form of interaction that we canhave so my strategy in that chapter wasto paint such a wonderful portrayal ofthe pleasures that are awaiting You byletting go of your defenses of lettinggo of all of your natural resistancefactors and opening yourself up to otherpeople is is a key to not just aromantic relationship but to CareerSuccess to mental energy to creativityto being open in general right andso I don't think I could have a a wi youknow a huge impact but we'll see whenthe when the book comes out but I'madvocating that sense of open openingyourself up to the universe to thecosmos itself as an energy thatpermeates the world and so that youdon't want to the feeling of beingclosed inside of your ego inside of youryourself I want to make it so you feelthe pain of that because you don'treally feel the pain of it you feel likeit's comfortable for you but I want tomake it clearity that it's notcomfortable it's deeply deeply painfuland it's disconnecting you from some ofthe best experiences you can have inlife so I have that strategy the onlyother hope I have is in the human Spirititself so a lot of this is being causedby social media I believe right um anduh and the instant and the the kind ofimmediate gratification we can get in somany ways and my hope is that youngpeople get fed up and get dis disgustedwith all this disconnection analienation in their life and that theyhunger from actually something morecommunal more interactive more real asopposed to Virtual and so that the humanSpirit can't be completely squashed bytechnology Etc so I have that hopebecause we've gone through these Cyclesbefore in history where people havebecome very invulnerable and very lockedand closed and suddenly there's anexplosion a creative explosion like inthe 1960s like in the 1920s like in 18thcentury Europe with the Casanova and thewhere seduction reached its kind of apyEtc so it has kind of swung back andforth between these moments where humansget incredibly closed and bitter andpartisan and everything's conflict andeveryone's divisive Etc and suddenlygoes in the oppositedirection I I have hope in thatpossibility and I structured my chapterto perhaps sweep that a little bit alongthat tie and see if I can have anyeffect well I think what you justdescribed in conversations like it andthat stem from it are likely to have atremendous effect I think it's exactlywhat's needed now and um certainly I'llbe uh to amplify that message I I agreewith everything you said and not justbecause you're sitting here as a guestuh on this podcast but because um it'sclear to me that while power dynamicsand seduction are um wired into ourhuman relations since the beginning oftime that we have reached a a verychallenging period in our history umit's somewhat of a relief to me to knowthat it's happened before but in a verydifferent context uh we hear a lot aboutThe Swinging back and forth of thependulum uh someone in fact uh PeterAtia online Physician's brother actuallysaid I um so we'll credit him he said noit's not a it's not a pendulum thatswings back and forth unfortunately nowit's become a wrecking ball so it'sswinging back and forth and doing damageas it as it reaches its um you know it'sextremes and I think that um I also lookforward to a time where peopleum acknowledge the the injustices aroundthem and and that have been done to themand others and um but somehow are ableto transcend that and the word that I'dlike to pick up on there is the wordjustice um it was pointed out to me uhby someone I respect very much that youknow having a sense of justice is a is awonderful and important thing and ashumans it's important to how westructure Society but I do think thatthat a lot of the negative things thatwe see out there nowadays are havesomething to do with the availability ofuh ready availability of pornographyhigh density calorie food Etc a bunch ofthings like that but that one of theissues with social media because it doeshave its positive aspects but one of thenegative issues in my mind is that it'sa steady flow of um examples ofInjustice so all day long you're justseeing things like that that piss youoff and that piss other people off andfor different reasons but but what waspointed out to me is that one of the keythings about a sense of Injustice is tobe able to determine whether or notthere's anything that you should doabout it and I think that everyone nowfeels a bit hijacked by all theinjustices we see because we feel likewell we're supposed to do somethingabout it but it may be that while wecan't let every Injustice pass thatbeing bombarded all day long with thingsthat upset us is hijacking ourcreativity it's distracting us from ourdeeper purpose it's preventing a senseof vulnerability that would lead to asense of deep love and on and on so Idon't think it's just about the The Lurethe tantalizing lures of of sex food andum and looking at you know bodies andhearing voices on social media I thinkthere is some validity to that but thatit's also that you know there's justample opportunity to go down thegravitational pole forces of Injusticelike H that's so frustrating why arethey doing that I mean I catch myselfdoing that talking to co-workers when Iwalk in about did you see this thingthis is crazy what's going on with itthey're crazy when you know as opposedto thinking about anything else in thatmoment and I try and yank myself out ofthat but I I think that um you're notgoing to do it alone but I think youwill play a major role in saving us fromthis because people I do I think becausepeople just need to see themselvesthrough a different lens and realizethis is distracting me from who I'msupposed to be well a lot of what whatmodern life should involve is the"

do you care toexpand on that a bit I think um we couldprobably take three four hours toexplore all this in full um but I wasstruck by some of the things that yousaid um because I agree completely thatum just as we are not given a road mapWhen we arrive in the world as to how tofind our purpose I think there's also avery conflicted road map that's thrownin front of us and indeed conflictingmultiple road maps about what it meansto be masculine or feminine or somecombination of both which of courseeverybody is some combination of bothjust to varying degrees well um yeah somen have a feminine side to them whichif you try to repress it will come outin other ways and women have a masculineside to them I think Yung describe thisvery well with the anima and the Animuswhich I think is is extremelyreal um it's very very confusing timesfor both men and for women right now wedon't know the roles that there there'reeverything is just so fluid and it'svery very difficult particularly ifyou're young so young women are gettingthis idea that everything should beequal and that women should have and ofcourse it's right should have be paidthe same and should have the same careeropportunities there should be noPrejudice or harassment or anything butat the same time on social media it'sall about looking perfect and looks areare incredibly important and if you'renot hot you're in terrible trouble and alot of young girls are extremelyconfused by this they're getting mixedsignals right and boys are even inperhaps even worse circumstances wherebeing masculine is seen as somethingnegative so we don't have any ideals outthere anymore of what whatconstitutes a good positive form offemininity and a good positive form ofmasculinity in fact we even think thatthere shouldn't be anything like thatthere's no such thing as being masculineor feminine whatever it's very veryconfusing and so you know I I think ofof of masculine traits that I think arevery positive and that should be outthere to kind of counteract the sort ofAndrew Tate seduction that a lot ofyoung men are falling for and it's akind of an inner strength where you'resort of in control of your emotionsyou're not invulnerable etc etc but umyou can takecriticism you can take PE you you knowyou can have moments of failure andyou'll bounce back but you have a kindof res inner resilience and a kind ofinner strength a kind of a quiet calmthat I think used to be exemplified inmovie icons like a Gary Cooper typething right and that kind of sense ofinner calmness where you're nothysterical you're not getting upsetabout everything that happens where youhave a kind of an inner strength and aconfidence and you can withstand kind ofwhat Ryan holiday talks about a lotabout with stoicism you can withstandall of the hardships in life but youhave that Citadel Within you is a veryvery powerful form of masculinity asopposed to it's all about sleeping witha lot of women having really fast carsyou know being abusive and being a bullyetc etc these are signs of weakness ofinsecurity and to be masculine should bea sense of security and inner confidenceand Inner Strength right and that's whatwe should venerate in our culture and weshould have icons like that okay um itdoesn't mean that that there's no rolefor men who are not masculine or havemore of the feminine virtues that's alsothere's definitely a role for that andyou know we see a lot of that in allsorts of Arenas of life and then thereshould be a positive model for women youknow where instead of their appearancesbeing judged by their appearances andhaving to conform to ideals of what'shot or not it's about being incrediblypowerful and comp ident and and haveexpertise and being really successful inyour career and and as opposed to beingcontinually judged by your appearanceswhich is very damagingso these are terrible times I mean I Ifeel fortunate that I grew up in a timewhere there were these kind of modelsfor me to go by and I think of my fatherwho who was a very quiet man and he washe was just a middle class s salesman isbasically what he was he just sold forall his whole life he sold chemicalsupplies for one company um but he wasvery dignified he treated people well hewas very calm and very quiet but he alsowas very empathetic that was my rolemodel for what I think is a goodmasculine energy and I think a lot ofpeople just don't have that and they'revery lost and so I don't know what theanswer is to that I can't really producethat out of thin air but I wish I couldwell certainly nowadays there are manymore um let's say examples and optionsof masculine and feminine qualities outthere for observation because of socialmedia and because of the internet uh andas you point out before a key feature tobecoming a functional human beingespecially nowadays is learning what toignore I mean there's an interestingidea in the circles around nutrition andhealth that you know never before inhuman history have human beings beenable to access such a wide variety offoods that are differ from what theirancestors ate and I don't even meanancient ancestors I mean if you grew upin the Bay Area as I did in the 1970sand 80s there were few ethnicrestaurants but we ate the same you know15 or 20 Foods over and over again rightand then eventually that exploded intodozens of options and more and fusionfoods and all sorts of things and sothere is this idea in the nutritioncommunities that we are not hardwired toum think about and discern so manydifferent food options that you knowthat's um and to taste so many distinctflavors whereas before people oneportion of the planet or country ategenerally one way in a given season ifthere's seasonality etc etc in a similarvein um we are now and children too arenow um overwhelmed with a number ofdifferent options of how to expressoneself both masculinity and femininitybut generally speaking and so thequestion is then how does one chooseright how does one decide what's what'sfunctional what works what's best what'sme right everyone asking themselves whoam I right I think all teenagers I findthis fascinating ask themselves who am Iadults don't tend to ask themselves thatquestion but who am I I still ask myselfquestion okay well that's good maybe Ishould ask myself that more often but umI thinkthat we clearly have gone over a cliffwith this stuff I don't think we'restill at the point where we're kind ofveering towards the edge of of confusionI think young people are really confusedbecause the moment one assumes uh oneclear and let's say balanced Mas set ofmasculine feminine attributes or maybeve a bit more masculine or a bit morefeminine it's like um there are amillion examples telling you that that'swrong I know and then sometimes has thetendency to Anchor to well no no I'mright because this is this is who I amand then all of a sudden you're you'rein a larger battle so uh you know GaryCooper's great love his movies um butwe're like we now have a millionvariations on Gary Cooper um that don'tlook anything like the Gary Cooper youand I are talking about and a lot ofpeople won't even know who we're talkingabout but I

I'm 13 my homewas completely broken no semblance ofthe reality it was before you know whoare the the males in my life I'm goingto orient to and fortunately for me Iassigned mentors to me whether or notthey knew it or not that really helpedme along and I changed them up as yourecommend there wasn't one um Iunderstood there was a breaking upprocess an integration process combinedining and threading together differentthings I think I truly believe thatthat's what's required that um itdoesn't have to be 100% Gary Cooper itcan be 10% Robert Green 10% someone elseyou know 5% this and creating a piechart of sorts of you know who onewishes to be in a given context but thattakes work it takes a bit of work anddiscernment but gosh that's powerful umand really credit goes to you because Iyou know you were a mentor of mine youdidn't even realize it in the way thatyou forge and organize information andthere were others and but Mastery iswhere I learned to do that and this isnot a podcast it's a a sales pitch forMastery but gosh it really taught meokay I have a graduate adviser she waswonderful and Brilliant but she didn'tknow how to explain a lot of things tome so I'd find someone else for thatright and someone else for the otherthing and someone else for the otherthing and together create a patchwork ofof really excellent mentors that made alot of sense to me yeah yeah so I Ithink there's a a role for that processthat you spell out in Mastery in thelarger context of like could have becomeas a person and that includes masculineand feminine ideals yeah and and it's anongoing process throughout your life sowho you glommed on to when you were 14or 15 will change when you're 19 I had aseries of people like you're talkingabout my high school English teacher whohad an enormous impact on me who taughtme basically how to write I internalizedhis voice when went to Berkeley I had aprofessor there who became my kind ofsurrogate father at Berkeley who Ideeply admired for his level ofscholarship so he became kind of anintellectual role model later in lifewhen I finally wrote my first book I meta man steers who was a book packager whounderstood the business Etc he kind ofsaved me he was sort of my mentor forthe next phase in my life so on and onand on I found people but they havepositive qualities qualities they admirethey're not perfect everyone isflawed and so at some point maybe yousee too many of the flaws you go on Ineed somebody new in my life but there'snothing wrong with that it's not likeyou're you're you're violating any codesor hurting them you move on to somebodyelse but the sense of finding peoplewhose qualities you admire we don'tlearn from people just by followingtheir ideas we pick up their energytheir Spirit now you didn't necessarilypick up my energy or Spirit from ReadingMaster although maybe you did I don'tknow but when you're interacting withthat professor at Stanford or whateverit's not just verbally there's kind of anon-verbal communication going on you'reinternalizing some of the positivequalities that you saw in them andfinding these series of mentors becauseI call it surrogateparents you can't choose your father andmother but you can choose these idealsfor you can choose these mentor towardsin your life you can kind of rewriteyour family history and find that FatherFigure You Never Had by glomming ontothis person but it has to be the rightfit it has to be someone that youconnect to emotionally andintellectually and that has the positivequalities you wish for yourself wellI'll embarrass you perhaps by sayingthat um since I was a freshman incollege which is really when I turned myacademic life around and really my lifearound I've maintained the same notebookwith a list of names of people that Iadmire and who I'm um you know trying toemulate in some way not in every waycertainly and certain names have beencrossed off but um most of them havesurvived and and certainly after readingMastery your name made that list and umand I hope I'm not being crossed off atsome point no not at all not not at alland through Reading Mastery there werethere were additional names um you knowI had the great the great Misfortune ofhaving all three of my academic advisersdie suicide cancer cancer which soundstragic the the joke in my field is youdon't want me to work for you that'swhat that's what everyone says but bybeing essentially scientificallyorphaned because there's a strong Mentormentee relationship in science andprogression through the career uh trackit forced me to go out and find otherpeople and also to learn how to quoteunquote mother and father myself in thecontext of profession and I got a lot ofhelp but um I I can't emphasize enoughhow valuable that practice is and sowhen one looks out on the landscape ofsocial media options I mean these areliterally just options of people to youknow we call it following but um youknow it probably should be calledsomething else uh because following youknow it fall short of emulating orattempting to emulate but I think thatin the context of masculine and feminineideals this is so critical but it's likethe buffet of food is so enormous nowright I mean you've got every cuisine onthe table so we're we're not wired forthat no and I know personally I I getvery agitated and upset if I go to themarket and I have to choose between 30items and I have no idea what I want itmakes me really cranky and upset whereasif I know okay I can have this food Ican't have that I'm only looking forthis okay it's easy it doesn't take twohours and waste my time too much choiceis very detrimental to the human being Ithink and that's why going back to whatI originally said when you have thatsense of purpose about your life aboutwhat's important it does just infectsyour career but it infects everyeverything you do so you know eatingthis food is going to drain me of myenergy that I need to create this thingthat means so much to me and energy andfeeling my my brain active and alive isincredibly important value all right I'mnot going to eat all that Sugar becauseit's bad for me right it means I'm notgoing to get outraged by these things onthe internet because it's a waste oftime I can't do anything about it it'sjust feeding on my you know on my Iforget the part of the brain that'sthat's like the amydala or whateverright so no I don't want to go thereright and on and on and on all thesethings in social media some of it's goodsome of it's interesting I can followAndrew huberman's podcast and I enjoythat and I learn a lot from it but a lotof these podcasts are useless they'rethey're not helping me in any way so itgives you this kind of filter and thisradar to cut out those hundred differentchoices that drive us absolutely crazyand I know maybe I'm partially I maybeI'm a little bit I don't know I hate tosay that maybe I'm partially on theSpectrum or something but I can't transcan't stand too many choices itcompletely drives me nuts so I alwayshave to kind of funnel my energy intosomething to things that are productiveand having a sense of your purposewhenever you discovered in your 20shopefully gives you that ability to saythese are the positive role models Iwant in my life these are the mentorsand the thing about following people onsocial medas it's so easy it's just aclick it doesn't mean anything a mentorrelationship takes work it takes couragebecause you have to actually go up tosomebody and physically ask for theirhelp and a lot of people write to me sayI'm afraid of asking this importantpowerful person to be their mentee rightso it involves a sense of social couragewhere you have to literally engage withanother human being who you admire andwho you think is powerful so it'sbuilding your social skills Etc but it'sa skill you develop you can't justfollow someone you can't just watchtheir lectures you have to engage withthem and you have to get over some ofyour fears and your anxieties in theprocess yeah and I might add to it uh Ithink everything you say is absolutelytrue and I think um engaging in the thevarious um tools that they recommend isimmensely helpful like I think hearhearing about a book is great reading abook is even better um thinking about abook is even that you read is evenbetter than that and then uh writingdown your own ideas and writing a bookwell that's that's the big win right andthat's what the world I believe that'swhat the universe wants from us notnecessarily to write a book but you knowtranslate what I just said to any numberof different Endeavors yeah you want tobe able to think for yourself right so"

slowlybecome your own ideas by interactingwith them by creating and like puttingthem through your own lens so somedayit's it's a book stirring in me is theart of thinking and how to use that kindof process and go deeper into it and Italked a lot about it in one of mypodcasts which might be the seed of abook but it's it's the the differencebetween dead thinking and Alive thinkingideas can be either alive or they can bedead and an alive idea is something thatenters your brain from an externalSource a philosopher an article somebodyyou admire somebody you hate and thenyou absorb it and you think about it andyou decide I'm going to turn it aroundinto this and I'm going to make it aliveand it's going to make it somethingthat's part of me another part of analive idea is um you have an idea thatcomes to you about a book or a projector something about the world and you gomaybe that's not actually true maybe theopposite is true and you go through aprocess and you cycle through it on andon and you reflect on it and you refinethis idea and maybe it turns into itsopposite and through the process ofreflecting and correcting and revisingit you turn it into something livingsomething alive within you right on andon and on and what prevents people fromgoing through that process which wouldbe the subject of my book is basicallyanxiety because I think how you handleanxiety is the most important kind ofquality in life it'll determine whetheryou will be successful whether you willfind your career path or whether youwon't be able to I don't know if you canfollow that idea at all but um anxietyis a signal to you that you don'tunderstand something that that there's aproblem out there that that you can'tresolve and so what happen Happ s tomost people if you're insecure is youglom onto something instant and easy toget rid of your feeling of anxiety Idon't understand this problem oh it mustbe a must a must be the answer becausethis person said that right and so youdon't develop the the ability to thinkyou don't Dev the ability to go to thenext level but if you take that anxietyand you go all right maybe a is ananswer and then you start going througha and then you go no maybe a isn't theanswer maybe B is the answer you're ableto surmount your anxiety and go past itfurther and further and further youdon't rush for the first availableanswer that's out there right you'reable to go through a process of refiningthings and so in yourcareer if you're anxious for Success ifyou're anxious for money you're going tomake the wrong choices but if you'reable to deal with that anxiety and saymaybe I'm I have to think more deeplyabout where I'm going I have to come upwith other alternatives then you'regoing to make a much better choice onand on and on so how if you're deal ifyou're a creative person it's very verychallenging to have that blank piece ofpaper before you that book that youhaven't written that film or whateveryou're filled with a lot of anxiety andyou have to deal with it and if you'reable to turn into something creative andproductive then great things will happenyou'll create a masterpiece so theability to deal with anxiety and to notgive into the most instant gratificationthat you can get is to me a marker ofsomebody who will be creative and willinvent something as opposed to peoplewho just recycle old and deadideas Amen to that I uh was once toldthat you know anxiety makes children ofus all and not in the positive sense ofbeing childlike you know it it regressesus to a mode where we feel a completelack of control and I completely agreethat being able to manage anxiety andand work dance with it yeah since wecan't rid ourselves of it no perhaps norshould we right because it's a signal asyou point out that we don't understandsomething that there's there's somethingto get curious about right a process orsomething out there or both I think uhthat really resonates yeah and I think alot of people will benefit from fromhearing that because I think we hear theword flow and we just all imagine I evencatch myself imagining that you knowwhen Robert Green sits down to rightit's like there's a blank sheet and thenhe just kind of meditates and then boomout com these books um but I you know ifI get realistic for a second I'm surethat there's a lot of inner turmoil andanxiety my God you have no idea so um myprocess is is 95% pain and maybe 2 and ahalf% ecstasy and I don't know what theother two and a half% would be but um soI write a story because all in my newbook and most of my books I always beginwith the story from historyEtc and it is so bad it I just I can'tbelieve how bad how flat it is how itsucks I'm so embarrassed I hate myselfthen I go and I go dig into and I startchanging the words in it I start makinga little bit better the second versionIt's kind of palatable but it stillsucks it's if I let it out the world it'be very embarrassing I work I it's ananxious you know and my wife can tellyou I'm a miserable being when thathappens everything looks black to me atthat point and and I pushed through itso if I gave in to my anxiety and thishappens with a lot of books and writersI would just put out that second versionwhich isn't very good it isn't verystrong it isn't thought through becausemy ideas when I look at them the firsttime I go that's not real that's not theactual thing that's going on here Robertyou've missed the mark you want to hitwhat's actually real in that story soyou have to go deeper and deeper andharder and harder and harder so I don'tjust give up and go here's the chapter Igo it's got to be better it's got to bebetter untilfinally after two months ofstruggling it seems like it's it's goneto the place that I want it to be inright but I I use that anxiety to keepimproving and making it better and thenwhen I reach that point and the story isgood enough and I can let my wife readit and then my editor I feel great Ihave that 2% moment of Joy but it camethrough all of that anxiety but I cancan tell you the feeling of fulfillmentwhen I finish a chapter is pretty damngreat when I finish abook it's better than any kind of drugexperience anyone could ever have it'ssuch a wonderful feeling ofaccomplishment and pushing past all thebarriers you know so my process involvesa lot of anxiety and dealing with that'swhy I'm talking about it why I want towrite a book about it thank you forsharing that um I'm attempting to writea book and have been for several yearsand now I feel a little bit better butclearly I need to ratchet down harder umbut in other domains of life I I amfamiliar with the experience of tons ofanxiety and just okay I'm going to justget to this one Milestone and then I'llfigure out the next Milestone but eventhat process of saying okay I'm going tobreak this down into Milestones itselfis anxiety provoking it's just that butat some point it generates enoughinertia that you just that you just sortof stumble forward into the process andthen keep going so try not to bloodyoneself that's right too much yeah Ithink a lot of people will benefit fromhearing about that in fact I'm certainthey will So speaking of anxiety youhave a clip on the internet that we will"

don'teven remember what I said you're gonnahave to remind me oh it's so goodumone point in particular yeah that uh Iremember um that I think is oh so trueis that there needs to be at least oneand probably several uh points of likereal convergence in terms of one'sinterests or likes that go beyond likewhat food somebody likes or uh you knowwhat type of house they want to live inbut that actually traces back to theseearly form forms of delight and youmentioned uh that for you and thereforepresumably your partner that you know amutual love and respect for Animalshappens to be one of those things withinthe context of your relationship rightthat not that A Love For Animals isrequired for me it sure as hell is rightexactly I could never go out with awoman who didn't love animals right mysister used to tease me that um if awoman gave me a birthday card or a cardthat had a drawing of a particularanimal which I'm particularly fond of mysister used I have an older sister andshe used to say oh no it's over he'sgone you know that it would you know umfortunately it's it's not that simple umbut uh there's some truth to what shewas saying um it's certainly uh it'snecessary but not sufficient but maybeyou could elaborate a little bit on thisnotion of um convergent interest andcontrast it with a lot of what peopletend to hear and say about what'simportant in Partnershipbecause I think this is something that alot of people grapple with both in termsof finding a partner and in terms ofbuildingpartnership well um you have to you knowthere's you can there's differentrelationships you can have I mean do youwant like a one week a one monthrelationship or you looking forsomething longer more satisfying thatwill entail you know maybe years ofbeingtogether and um you know uh people canget very boring very quickly rightparticularly if you can't have aconversation with them about subjectsthat interest you and so you mentionanimals animals is a very good examplebecause it's not I'm not saying that youboth have to be Democrats or Republicansthat's too banal and superficial but theLove of Animals reaches into yourcharacter reaches something deep insideof you or your dislike of animals ifthat happens to be the case but itsignals something about it that's soPrimal that's so connected to achild that there's going to be a deepconnection there and it's not like youhave to both love cats which is good ifthat happens to be the case but justanimals in general you love their energyyou love the fact that they're thatthey're innocent in their own way youlove the fact that they're not playinggames with you you love the kind ofinstant love you can get from them kindof thing and you connect to them on thatlevel is a very very positive signbecause it goes beyond just intell ualthings into something emotional andvisceral so really the emotionalconnections the values that you havetogether are very important money isanother one that's extremely importantso if one of you is incredibly materialoriented and it's all about money is isis power and success and comfort and theother isn't really into it it's intospending money Etc a lot of people haveendless fights or something like moneyright where there's no convergence thereand money signals a deeper value aboutthe person so I'm not saying there'sanything wrong if money motivates youI'm not moralizing about it because thatcan signal a value that maybe you grewup without it and that feelingcomfortable and feeling like you don'thave to worry about something is veryvery important to you and the not beinginterested in money reveals somethingabout your character so I'm tellingpeople you want to look at the person'scharacter and see a kind of convergencethere and something that can last and Iremember I was reading um for one of mybooks about Franklin delanor Rooseveltand Elanor Roosevelt and the thing of itwas Franklin delanor Roosevelt was hisincredibly handsome vibrant young manbefore he got polio very active veryathletic very handsome all the womenwere after him he was like the perfectmatch he was wealthy and ElanorRoosevelt was like the ugly duckling sheshe wasn't very pretty she was kind ofsociallyawkward but he saw into her character hesaw that intellectually she was a matchfor him he saw that they had kind ofsimilar interests on that level that I'mtalking about that go beneath just thesurfaces and he chose Elanor andeveryone was shocked about it you knownobody was was trying to court ElanorI've WR her last name at the time Ithink she might have even be a Rooseveltum so it was very shocking you said I Ilooked at somebody who I could last withwho had some qualities that were muchmore important to me and it ended upbeing a very satisfying relationship ofcourse later on he had his Dianes so itwasn't perfect but it was a very it wasa very positive relationship so seeingyour values in life you know when itcomes to like money when it comes tolike career when it comes to comfort orlack of comfort some people like likenot being comfortable they like being onthe edge they want challenges they wantto move from City to City kind of thingand if you partner with somebody whojust wants to live in the same houseyou're going to have conflict afterconflict after conflict the sex might begreat and that might be good for a monthor two months I have nothing againstthat I'm not going to judge that eitherbut it won't lead to a longlastingrelationship you know Sports andAthletics are another thing is thissomeone that likes the outdoors or is itsomeone who's you know like zaha Gaborhas to be in in a Time Square in apenthouse in Manhattan you know kind ofthing so values that reach inside of aper character that are deeply ingrainedthat you can almost not change you can'tcontrol and there's a convergence thereon several levels is a sign that you canhave a deep connection with that personand it's very important and if thoseconnections are good and there's aphysical attraction because if withoutthe physical attraction it will kind offizzle out you've got a recipe for forincredible success for something thatcan really last and having a lastingrelationship as I'vehad is is such an anchor in your lifeyou know for me for someone who works ashard as I do and hopefully for her aswell it just grounds me and it makeslife so much simpler and easier and andit's not just simple and easy there's alot of love and a great deal of ofof deeper emotions involved but having along-term relationship if you can haveit is something that pays off in so manydividends so being able to find thatkind of convergence you know when Ifirst met my now my wife um I had a catat the time I'd always been a dog personbut this was a cat I had and I love thatcat like hell I can't believe he wassuch a wonderfulcat I brought her over to my apartmenton the first date I wanted to see herreaction to the cat you know cuz Igenerally and I don't know peoplemisjudge that women who don't like catsI I don't I can't get along with rightbecause there's something feline in thefeminine nature that I love and sheloved my cat boy that was the best signof all and things just Bloss and sheloved me for loving a cat so there was agreat convergence right there that wesaw right away and there were otherthings but that was the first oneI love that story and everything you"

least some knowingof self Because unless you know yourcharacter one's own character then it'simpossible to really determine ifsomebody else's character is going tomesh well with it or not self awarenessis is actually the most importantquality in life for all aspects but yeahI mean if we go by social pressures aman will choose a trophy wife who lookssexy and hot and will impress all of hismale friends etc etc you go by thethings that culture tells you that theseare the right images for you right andthen there won't be any connection toyou because you're choosing for purposesthat don't connect to who you are and soyou have to know yourself you have toknow what you love you have to know whatyou hate I think most people know thatthey love animals or don't love animalsI think most people know that they likestability or they like things to be kindof slightly chaotic I don't think youhave to go through deep levels ofintrospection but what you have to do iswhen you're involved in a relationshipyou have to think that those thingsmatter that's the problem you tend tothink that those things may you thinkthat sex matters more than anythingphysical attraction matters or you thinkthat the person having a lot of moneymatters etc etc you don't think thatthis other aspect is important if youvalue what I'm talking about then yourself-awareness will kick in because youreally basically know these essentialbasic parts about your own character Ithink people sometimes get um distractedby admiration of qualities that theymightfindadmirable but that don't mesh with theirown character I've seen this many timesbefore where well uh where someone willsay well there someone will startlisting off the positive attributes ofthe person that they happen to be datinglike he does this blank blank and blankshe does this you know he volunteers Etcand that's all great I mean volunteeringfor good causes I'm all in support ofthat but then what they're overlookingoften it seems is whether or not that'sa core value for them or whether or notit's just something that they admire Ihear a lot of admiration in the earlydays of relationships that later I hearabout failing and what you're talkingabout is something deeper more uhaligned with one's own sense of self andit almost um leads me to use the wordyou know sort of a more about energeticsit's like merging of people's energieswhich sounds very new Agy and that's notmy intention but but I think it relatesto something that we do hear a lot aboutand I think is valid which is how itfeels to be around somebody in differentcontext like do we feel at ease do wefeel lightness an ability to expressourselves and to um and do we enjoy andadmire them in their expression asopposed to just admiring what they dothey've accomplished blank blank andblank I see right they uh manifest thesequalities that I wish I had right youhear that and and aspire to have whichis very different than a meshing of ofenergies also there a couple otherthings you have to understand theircharacter as well and people can be verydeceptive and very slippery and can wearmasks one telling sign that I've noticedin my own relationships in thepast is that the woman would be acertain way with me that I thought wasvery good and I liked and then themoment we were with other people sheacted in a way that was very irritatingit's like a different character and Ireally kind of fell out of love with herwhen I saw her in social interactionsshe revealed so with me she was almostwearing a mask and playing a game butthe moment she entered a differentcircumstance I saw another aspect to hercharacter so you also have to be veryattentive to their character what liesunderneath that they have some of thesevalues that they're not just trying towin you over for whatever and they'replaying along with you the other thingthat's veryimportant is a sense of mystery so apartner can become boring very veryquickly right after a year you knowevery single thing about them rightthey're going to say the same things theconversations go around in circles it'sjust you've reached an end there's nosurprises there's no mystery you wantsomebody where they have corners thatyou don't really see at first that theysurprise you sometimes suddenly there'sa quality that you hadn't suspectedbefore so people who are too obvious whoare too familiar who show everythinginstantly they're going to end up boringyou right but people who have a bit ofReserve I I know this is maybe I'm I'mprojecting my own values on the worldbut people who who kind of intrigue youthat you don't fully understand thatmake you want to know more and if theycan be like that after two years orthree years or five years wow that'sfantastic but the sense of I know everysingle thing about this person theynever surprise me anymore is what kindof breaks the the the enchantment andleads to the end of the relationshipwell the idea of more to learn aboutsomebodyum perhaps also suggests that they arecontinuing to evolve into forage in thelandscape of life you know that they'renot fully baked yeah right that which Ithink is um an interesting idea induring the four episode series that wedid on Mental Health Paul kti apsychiatrist said that um a matching ofgenerative drives which he defined asthe desire to create something in theworld of One's Own expression is reallycritical in relationship and he said youknow it matters less whether or not oneperson likes classical music and theother person rock and roll provided thattheir relationship to music is similaror something of that sort like that it'sabout a drive to of a certain sort toengage in the world so one person couldlove music the other person's not intomusic but the way that they approachlife is one of perhaps Mutual curiositydesire to find out Etc and that thisexists on a Continuum uh I'm curious ifuh it seems to jive with what you'rewith what you're saying it does but theonly thing I would add isif you love classical music and theylove like heavy metal music you're goingto be driven crazy pretty quickly it'sgoing to you know it's not going to meshwith you and I know I would have thatproblem you'll both be in headphones alot right so the fact that you both havebecause music is like animals in a wayso I agree completely with what you'resaying but I would say maybe music isn'tthe best example because music sayssomething very deep about a person rightthere and you know I'm not saying one issuperior to the other but it revealssomething that's nonverbal that thatkind of gives you a window into who theyare so if they like punk rock like youdo and I grew up on punk rock there's arebellious thing this to there's ananti-authoritarian quality that's verystrong you get you get to see thatthrough them if they like modart andsoft string quartets there's somebodythat kind of value softness andtranquility and peace and you're notlike that so the music kind of shows yousomething a quality about theircharacter that can be very telling andbe very eloquent and so it doesn't meanthat you both have to love The Clash orthe dead kennedies or whatever showingmy own Generation Um but that you bothhave that rebellious streak and thatrebellious streak could be you likethere's classical music composers whocould be pretty damn rebellious andangry you know and I actually kind oflike them so that convergence I think isa positive one kind of thing but ingeneral I agree with that I'm curiousabout the non-verbal communication"

justdescribed is really about a resonancearound the non-verbal stuff I mean itcan be articulated with words yeah um Ilove animals I love this music this isthe best song like did you see that likeotter are amazing right this kind ofthing but language is just an attempt toplace you know words on a Feeling inthose instances so it it can beclassified as non-verbalum with respect to non-verbalcommunication you'vewritten fairly extensively about thefact that people often communicate withtheir body and facialexpressions um uh I'm certainly familiarwith the somewhat if not very eeriesensation of somebody um smiling like atoothy smile and then it as they pivotaway that smile just dissolving veryquickly and um you know you don't haveto be a neuroscientist or a psychologistto realize that like there was somethingquite false about that experience orthat this person experiences um emotionslike step functions on off on off whichis not how most of us EXP experienceemotions most of us experience emotionswith some pervasiveness like I was happywalking in the door because of somethinghappened before and so I'm going tosmile while I'm walking in the door if Isee something shocking and dismaying ofcourse I'm going to frown I'm going towipe away that smile but those are rareinstances so um let's talk about themouth the eyes the face the body in thecontext of communication what are whatare some important things to payattention that I I I I want to go backon as far as convergence is sense ofhumor is extremely important right soit's not like you both like the samecomedians but if one person likes ranchyhumor and the other person doesn'tthat's that's a problem and also thefact that the person doesn't have asense of humor or doesn't make you laughis a very very bad sign so I wanted toadd that one component in there I'm soglad you did uh someone who can make melaugh has uh you know necessary but notsufficient but boy it's uh approachingsufficient yeah I'd say so I'd say so umyou know when it comes to the Art ofSeduction The Art of Seduction is anonverbal language that you must Masterit's a language of the gifts that yougive it's a ma it's a language of of howyou smell it's a language that you TRthat you communicate through the eyesetc etc and the thing you have tounderstand about the human being is thatwe evolved for much longer period oftime without words than the small 4035,000 years that we have symboliclanguage so during that vast period ofDarkness where we did not have words wewere non communicating non-verbally wewere picking up signals from people wewere watching every little detail oftheir behavior because we didn't havewords to decipher it so it's wired intoour brains to have an amazingsensitivity to people's non-verbalCommunications we can almost betelepathic that way if we learn thatlanguage the problem is we have thecapacity but we don't develop it at allbecause we are so word oriented you'rejust listening to people if you're evenlistening to them at all you're justhearing the words and you're so thinkingthat the words mean something the wordsare sincere which they're often not atthe same time that you're listening somuch to words people are shuffling intheir chair they're kind of looking awaythey're looking at other women or othermen their voice is kind of tremblingwhen they say something that where itshouldn't tremble their eyes are deadthe smile is kind of fake you're notwatching any of it so the most importantthing in non-verbal communication lawnumber one is pay attention to itcontinually develop the practice ofshutting off the words and watchingpeople almost as if you took thetelevision and muted it right and justwatched their behavior it's not easy andit's not natural because it's the wordsthe words were words we want to we wantto focus on them right but your abilityto turn that television off to mute itwill suddenly open up so many thingsabout people they reveal so much thingsSigman Freud said people are continuallyoozing out all of their secrets throughtheir non-verbal Behavior you can readthem like an open book if you masterthis language and I have in the laws ofhuman nature I describe the story ofMilton Ericson I don't know if you'refamiliar with Milton ericsen perhaps thegreatest modern master of non-verbalcommunication he was a an amazingpsychologist he sort of um is theinspiration behind um n what's it calledn help me out here neuro linguistic ohthe NLP I it's kind of a bastardizationof his ideas but he's he createdhypnotherapy he's the person who createdhypnotherapy certainly I uh hypnotherapyis is a valid psychiatric practice Imean it's excellent clinical data tosupport well Milton Ericson had Poliowhen he was 19and he was paralyzed his entire body wasparalyzed he couldn't even move hiseyeballs right and he sat in bed and hehad a very active mind and he was goingto just die from sheer boredom and whathe did during the two years of beingparalyzed like that was just watchingPeople's non-verbal communication andmaking notes in his brain and learningevery single he learned the 20 differentforms of yes the 100 different forms ofno right every intonation how somebodyentered the room how they left the roomyou know how they looked at him with thepity or empathy or something he masteredit and then when he became apsychiatrist and he treated people theythought he was psychic he could seeeverything into them it's because fortwo years that's all he could do wasObserve them he couldn't speak hecouldn't do anything he couldn't read abook so you have that same power but youdon't have po obviously but you have tofirst pay attention to it right it's anamazing thing once you do it's a lot offun actually and I tell people go to acafe one day in your city wherever youlive and just watch people because youcan't hear them they're a few tablesaway watch their non-verbal Behavior asthey interact and see if if you pick upcues from them and there are things thatare signs of genuine emotions so forinstance an exercise you can do is yougo up to somebody from an angle wherethey can't see you coming up to them andyou surprise them you go hey hey Mikewhatever they turn for that second theirexpression reveals how they really thinkabout you you'll detect if you can pickup micro expressions and and you canthey're only like one 150th of a secondbut they're there you can express a kindof and they smile you can see the littledisdain in their eyes right then themask comes on right or you're talking tothem they're looking at you but theirfeet are facing in an opposite directionthat means that they're dying to getaway from you kind of thing these aresignals that you don't necessarily payattention to their posture will tell youeverything about their levels ofconfidence right on and on and on thefake smile if you can just Master theability to detect the fake smile it willgo wonders for you because you're ableto see what you really want to do is tosee the person with a genuine smileparticularly in romanticrelationships someone whose face lightsup a real smile lights your whole faceup it doesn't light your mouth thatthese parts of your face go up your eyesget alive there's like a there's like aa neuro thing going on in your brainthat's changing your whole facialexpression and it means that someonegenuinely likes you they're genuinelyinterested in you they're genuinelylaughing or connecting to you man if youcan see that it'll help you so much inthe Romantic realm and that'll help youget away from those toxic people thatare continually faking interest in youbecause a narcissist a toxicperson thrives by deceiving you with aCharming alluring front that makes youcome into their world then they can hurtyou then they can do something to youright then they have you in in in theirin their you know in their trap right sobeing able to see that they're notgenuinely interested in you that they'refaking it will help you avoid very toxicrelationships and as I said to you Idon't know if we were on air or not butdeep narcissists have dead eyes theythey almost can't help it they can fakethe smile they can fake everything elsebut the eyes you have to be able to readit because you say well what are deadeyes you'll know it when you see itthere's no life

you go to level three and itgets better and better you have anxietyanother aspect of intelligence isself-awareness right the beity to lookat yourself go I have biases I haveconfirmation bias I have

int I'mtalking about now intelligence notartificial intelligence is the beity todeal anxiety and go to a third levelintelligence is the ability to lookinside of yourself and see your ownbiases and the third thing is theability to see a holistic picture thekind of aha moment that scientists havewhere you accumulate all kind of datapoints and then out of nowhere an imagecomes to your mind of yeah there's theanswer you see the whole thing you seethe whole Gestalt right Simone vilecompared it to a a um a square Cube youcan only see a cube from one side or youcan never see a a square Cube you canonly see a side of it if it's rotatingyou're still only seeing sides of itonly in your mind can you picture thewhole thing so the mind has to gothrough a process to have holisticthinking if they can invent a machinemachine that can deal with anxiety andhas anxiety and can go to level three ifthey can make a machine that can beself-aware that can go the people whoprogram me have biases therefore I havebiases I also have a dark side becausepeople have program you have a dark sideif this machine can also thinkholistically beyond all of the datapoints and all the massive informationit's combined it can have that ahamoment all right I can see a humanconsciousness I can see creativity therethe other thing I would say is when Iwas a student at Berkeley going way backI was 19 years old I decided One Summerthis is a big paradigm shift for me I'mgoing to take this class in ancientGreek in six weeks they teach you a yearof ancient Greek that means every dayyou have an exam every Friday you have afinal exam eight hours every day of adead language I thought this would bethe best discipline for me after someonewho didn't been doing too many drugs tobe honest with you okay and so finallyat one point they give us this paragraphof the hardest ancient Greek writer ofall to read this was near the endthiddies or thiddies as theysay I st so I had I had like the wholenight to try and translate one paragraphI couldn't figure it out you have tounderstand the the weirdness of ancientCreek all the endings the weird ways ofthinking the whole picture that ahamoment was luding me at one point Ithought I got it and I translated it andI gave it to the teacher next day Iremember he was this kind of hippie thatyou'd have it Berkeley Dennis classicProfessor but also hippie the fact thatyou knew his first name is very tell Ican only remember his first name Dennishe he's he said Robert I can see yourthinking but you need to go to anotherlevel you missed you didn't have thataha moment you didn't put the wholething together you were close but youdidn't you have to try harder and thatstuck in my mind forever like whenever Ihave a problem I have to think harder Ihave to go to that next level now whatwould happen if I had pulled out mytranslation of through cities and justcopied that out right or what havehappened if I put it through chat GPTand it gave me the translation thatmuscle in my brain that I have developedfor 40 years that allows me to writebooks would never have developed andthat muscle is I don't know the answerhere I have to go to another level Ihave to try harder I have to think Ihave have to think I have to have thatengine worring around right but if Ijust grab for chat GPT it's deadened andthen we're going to have a wholegeneration of people who stop thinkingwho don't go through that process youknow you've heard of Douglas Heder Ithink he said people train to go toMount Everest it takes months physicalexertion it's painful then they climbMount Everest they see the top whoowwhat a great moment he said Chad GPT bethe equivalent of taking a helicopter tothe top of Mount Everest without any ofthat training and having the same momentit's not the same right you need to gothrough that process you need to gothrough that pain and if you just andthe thing of is Chad gbt we think we'reso modern So Sophisticated but reallywe're just seduced by Magic you put itin there and you see the scrigoing whoa It's like magic it's like amagician but it's empty it's like notyour brain functioning right it's payit's the Pagan part of us we like thatkind ofmagic as opposed to actually having togo through the thought process itself soI'm not in FA against having tools I usetools I use the internet I use GoogleI'm searching for like some factoid frommy book I find it I use it I I like itbut I've also learned to develop mybrain to think to get that engineconstantly moving and I'm deeplyconcerned about people who can't learn aforeign language who can't masteranything who just immediately grab thefirst answer that it generates etc etc Ihaveconcerns I am too and I was thinking amoment ago that you know like somepeople might hear what you just said andsay oh well the same thing was probablysaid about the automobile like how manyamazing experiences of walking from oneplace to another are going to be lostwhen people start driving from one placeto another but I think a key differenceand this certainly aligns witheverything you just said is that whatyou're talking about is not justarriving at the same destination you'resaying the destination itself isdifferent when one exerts some effortand experiences some anxiety to getthere so it's not the same as automobileversus horse versus walking versusairplane yeah it's fundamentallydifferent because the the journeytransforms the outcome yeah yeah I I'min agreement with you about many aspectsof AI I'm also excited about it in thecontext of certain things I I I I agreewith you if could be a tool but are weoperating the tool or is the tooloperating us is what I'm talking about Iam concerned a bit too especially in thecontext of what we've been talking aboutfor most of today's discussion about umavatars replacing our online personastoo much um you know theAvatar of ourselves is already takingplace through through filters through uhreduction of emotional expression toemojis through reduction of of languageto a diminish number of words to explainone's feelings you know a prior guest onthis podcast um Lisa Feldman Barrettwho's an expert in emotions talked abouthow the moment that a culture has a wordfor a particular subset of anxiousfeelings so so for instance she taughtme that in Japanese there's a word forthe sadness one experiences when theyget a bad haircut yeah I know you knowand so that normalizes the feeling andleads to feelings of less despair asopposed to what now many kids especiallygrow up learning which I'm anxious I'msad I'm depressed that you know inscience we say there are lumpers andthere are Splitters and they've beenarguing for years about like is that onebrain structure well if I name those twothings next to each other two differentthings not only can I name one aftermyself which is what tends to happen soto speak but when you have too manylumpers or too many Splitters things areeither overly simple or overly complexthat of course the right answer the thethe best use of naming things arrivesomeplace in the middle right that's howa field progresses because if you if youlump things together too much a fieldcan't progress you give yourself theillusion that it's progressing but it'snot progressing but if you split thingsup into a million differentsubcategories like just even the wordadrenaline is also called epinephrineand that's has to do with basicallypeople arguing over who got credit crazyand it's confused people for for decadesyeah and there's a there's another storythere that and I know

um this is thesort of stitching that looks likeperhaps I had been at the sewing machineum and not somebody with uh skilled butthey did a good job basically of puttingit back together why are those stitchesin your shirt tell us about the strokeand let's let's talk aboutneuroplasticity it could also seem likea fashion statement you know but itreally is isn't um well it was May of2018 it was my birthday and my wife gaveme this shirt I have a love of plaidsit's like I don't know why I just lovepatterns and plaids it must be like someScotch part of me some ancestor thingbut I love plaids can I interrupt youjust briefly forgive me everyone's goingto get upset that interrupt do you knowthat there is a fundamental circuit inyour visual cortex designed to detectplaid patterns no I did not know yes andwe can talk about why that is it'stightly tightly linked to your abilityto perceive motion really yeah and wecan go over it some other time but yeahso we'll talk about just as a Quee sookay yes back to your birthday okay soshe gave me a plaid shirt knowing howmuch I loved it and I love this shirt Ilove the colors in it etc etc and thentwo months three months later August 172018 I was driving my car she was withme I was pulling out into traffic Istarted driving and suddenly she'ssaying pull up Robert pull over go whywhy I can drive I'm fine and thensuddenly everything started gettingreally strange everything looked strangemy voice didn't sound the same and shewas like freaking out but she wasactually fairly calm which was amazing Iwas undergoing a stroke I had a bloodclot that was blocking the bra bloodflow to my brain I actually at one pointgot out of the car like I was I don'tknow what the hell I was thinking andand then she pulled me back in then therest goes blank and I had some weirdSensations that still remain with mebecause essentially I was on the vergeof dying because blood not flowing toyour brain is basically the end of youright unless something happens veryquickly and she either that or you'regoing to get severe brain damage so shecalled 911 right away she recognizedsomething my whole face was lookingfunny and they got thereI was unconscious and essentially theytook this shirt and I just scissored thething in half and took it off my headand then they intubated me I believe inmy hip area to get something the bloodclot was in my neck and they were ableto free it up and they rush me to thehospitaland I'm unconscious and then um I wakeup and I'm in a gurnie in the hospitaland I don't for a moment I'm thinkingmaybe I'm deadbecause I'm lying in a gurnie and Ialmost feel like I'm in a coffin I don'tknow what's going on and I have all ofthese weirdSensations and I I tell people we're socurious about death we think about deatha lot and you know is it final what doesit mean we really should pay attentionto dying dying is actually much moreinteresting in some ways than death andpeople who have died go through aprocess if it if it's long enough andpeople who have had near-deathexperiences like I do have gone throughthat process of dying and have come backto life and in the process ofdying strange things happen to the brainright so particularly with a stroke orsomething like that where blood stopsflowing to your oxygen stops flowing toyour brain you have kind of visions andthings that you might think arehallucinations but that later seem likeactually you are actually glimpsing thereality as opposed to the illusion thatthe brain creates so I've written aboutthis in my new book but um my idea ofthe brain is that it creates endlessseries of Illusions for you it createsthis seamless version of reality thesense of a self the sense of acontinuous self Through Time right itcreates a linear sense of timeprogressions it creates colors itcreates a world that visually you canseems familiar and etc etc but it's allillusion it's all a construction rightimages come into your brain and they'renot organized in any way and the Brainorganizes in a way that you canunderstand it well when you're dying allof that scrambles up and you actuallyare seeing something else so I saw forinstance that I really don't have a selfthat it doesn't really actually existthat I'm and the image that came to mymind mind cuz it was in sitting in thatgurnie was a weird feelingof like I can almost not explain it butit's as if you took an image ofsomething real in the world and youcompletely scrambled it up and it wasall wavy and you couldn't see whatexactly it was to me that was the imageI had of the self there are like 50different selves inside of you that areall competing and you think there's justone and you think it's consistent butthere's not it's illusion the self isliterally an illusion that your brainconstructs when you're dying you seethese things when you're dying you seeother things like that you see that timeis something very weird so I had anexperience of when I got out of the carand I got pulled in I thought like 10seconds had passed my wife told me nothose this was like 10 minutes I had nosense of time everything was scrambledand so it was very very El it taught meso much things that I can I can barelyeven express now I'm always now thinkingof strange things that come to mebecause my brain was damaged it made merealize that the brain createseverything so I can't communicate withmy hand my fingers I can't communicatemy brain can't communicate with my legright so you think that walking andwriting and handling things is just youryour body operating a certain way it'syour brain telling you how to move thesedifferent things when that brain stopsfunctioning you realize how much yourbrain determines everything it allstarts there and when there's damage toyour brain your whole thinking AltersEtc not to mention how you look at lifeitself after something like that so itwas a terrible experience it's ruined somany things that I loved in life butit's given me an awful lot as well inreturn that I I could go on for hoursand talk about because it was the mostpowerful experience of mylife when you were going through yourreemergence to Consciousness in thehospital did you feel as if you wereobserving these multiple versions ofyourself um maybe a different way tophrase it is did you feel you were sortof behind the circuit board that is yourbrain observing how you normallyfunction and you could see multipleversions of self or was it somethingelse where you sort of outside of yourbody and brain I think it was moreoutside of my body and brain I also hadthis other thing that happenedwhere I you know sometimes you can't REMyour memory might be playing tricks onyou so I've also have to realize thatmaybe I'm not remembering exactly whathappened or that I've since translatedin a different way so that's a caveathere and I'm aware of it but I had thisVision that I was dead at first when Ifirst became conscious and that I was upin the sky and I was looking down and mymother and my wife were talking and it'slike over my grave I suppose and I hadthis feeling ah everything's okay I'mgone but life goes on they're they'redoing fine it's okay right so I don'tknow about that sense of self whether itwas like I'm aware of it happening but Ihave a feeling it was something from theoutside I don't really know the answerto that because it's very confused theother feeling I had was life when I washaving the stroke was life draining outof me and my bones getting softer andsofter and softer and I can't reallylogically explain that the feeling ofBones softening up anddissolving but for weeks and monthsafterwards I could access that feelingof my bones dissolving Etc it was afeelingof all your energy draining out out ofyou and you're dying literally so umreading books about near-deathexperiences CU that's a lot of what I'mbig part of my next book God is it'sfascinating there's so many interestingthings to go in because it teaches us somuch I'm so glad a you survived yourstroke B that your mental faculties he'snot more grateful than I am I tell I Iprobably not but still very grateful sothere it just um illustrates howgrateful you must be umB that you've

perhaps notcoincidentally you referred to that asquote death ground yeah so um it's whatit's a strategy from my book I wrotewrote a book on strategy my version ofThe Art of War it's called 33 Strategiesof War but it's really about strategythe Strategic thinking it's inspiredfrom sunu the great Chinese strategistbut it has vast philosophicalimplications the ideais you can almost think of it likebarometric pressure when necessity ispressing in on you like your back isagainst the wall like you have to getsomething done and there's like thispressure around you you find energy inthere that you never believed beforeWilliam James talks about this when hetalks about getting a second windexplains it very eloquently when youfeel like your life's in danger suddenlyyou can you can leap over things thatyou never could leap over before sosunsu says put an Army on death groundand it will fight and until it's it winsmeaning put an army with its back to theocean or a back to the mountain and it'seither win or die they're going to fight10 times harder you're going to find theenergy in you that you normally lackwhen death is facing ing you in the faceor urgency or deadlines or peoplepressing in on you when that barometricpressure loosens up and there's none ofit you think you have all the time inthe world you get nothingdone wow man I'm23 I've got all these years ahead of meI'm going to figure it out right I'm notgoing to die I got 50 70 80 years aheadof me no you don't that pressure now isgone and you're wasting time you'reyou're you're doing all sorts of thingsthat aren't leading to any kind of skillyou're not learning or anything you needto put yourself on death ground you needto feel that barometric pressure whichis the actual reality the actual realityis you could die tomorrow you could havea stroke tomorrow you you could be firedtomorrow everything could fall apart youneed to have that sense of urgency nowbecause that's the reality you'refooling yourself by thinking you haveall of this time and so when you feelthatpressure suddenly you can move mountainsyou you have energy your life you knowyou just have Focus Etc neurologicallyeverything Clicks in you know and peoplewho've had that experience where they'vewhere they've felt like the the ship wasgoing under and they better get theiract together and survive they talk aboutall these physical processes I have astory in my new book I I hope I'm notboring you with all no quite theopposite about a mountainclimber whoum he he he was climbing this mountainby himself and he was having a greattime but there was a storm coming and hehad to get down and he suddenly fell andhe cut his leg open massively and therewas like a branch sticking in it and hehe broke all these bones and he was hewas going to die he was on a Ledge hecould see that it was getting dark andand storm clouds were were massing therewas going to be this was in the RockyMountain Mountain he was alone andsuddenly he managed to get up on his twofeet and he can't explain how but all ofthis energy all this adrenaline startedflowing in him and he said he was like amountain goat he was like going down theledge he he jumped he was able to kindof get down to another ledge he he gothe got out of it and for the for thenext 20 years it was haunted by how didthat happen I want that feeling againbecause it was actually the most staticfeeling I had energy that I neversuspected in myself and so he trieseverything to get that feeling back hetries climbing other mounts he triesgoing to to Mount Everest he tries andit doesn't come back and finally he kindof figures out the formula for it andwhy it happened he studies a lot ofNeuroscience it's a great book I'm usingit in my new book it's called bone bonegames it's very interesting book a lotof Science in it um and he got thefeeling back in a smaller sense but itwas the feeling of your life is indanger I better get my act together orit's the end and suddenly
