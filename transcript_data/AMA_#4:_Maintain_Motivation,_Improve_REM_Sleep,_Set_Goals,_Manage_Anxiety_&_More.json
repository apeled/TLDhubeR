            "text": "ANDREW HUBERMAN: Welcome to the Huberman Lab podcast, where we discuss science and science-based tools for everyday life. [MUSIC PLAYING] I'm Andrew Huberman, and I'm a professor of neurobiology and ophthalmology at Stanford School of Medicine. Today is an ask me anything or AMA episode, which is part of our premium subscriber content. Our premium channel was launched in order to raise support for the standard Huberman Lab podcast channel, which still comes out once a week every Monday and, of course, is zero cost to consumer. The premium channel is also designed to support exciting research being done at major universities like Stanford and elsewhere, research that's done on humans that should lead to protocols for mental health, physical health, and performance in the near future. If you'd like to check out the premium channel subscription model, you can go to hubermanlab.com/premium, and there you can subscribe for $10 a month or $100 a year. We also have a lifetime subscriber option. For those of you that are already Huberman Lab podcast premium subscribers and you're watching and/or hearing this, please go to hubermanlab.com/premium and download the premium podcast feed. And for those of you that are not already Huberman Lab premium podcast subscribers, you will be able to hear the first 15 minutes or so of this episode, and hopefully, that will allow you to discern whether or not you would like to become a premium subscriber. Without further ado, let's get to answering your questions. And as always, I will strive to be as accurate as possible, as thorough as possible, and yet, as concise as possible. Our first question is about motivation, "

            "text": "in particular, how to\nmaintain motivationover long periods of time.This was the question\nasked by Martin Zokov.He wrote, \"I alternate\nbetween periodsof two different states\nthat vary from a few weeksto a couple of months.I have extremely high\nmotivation in one state,where I can do multiple things--side projects, making music,\nas well as my main things,or really low-motivational\nstates, where I can barelydo anything, and I only look\nfor short term entertainment.\"I'm guessing, short-term\nentertainment comesin the form of video\ngames, social media,and just doing generally\nunproductive things,as we all do from time to time.He goes on to write, \"What would\nbe the best set of protocolsto normalize those\nextremes into a morestable and consistent state?\"Well, first off, this is\nan excellent question.I say that because it's a\nquestion that I hear a lot,and I think that many people\nare interested in knowing howmotivated they ought to feel.And I think a lot of\npeople also feel a lot lessmotivated than they would like.Now, here the question\nwas, specifically,about how to not go from\nthese extremes of daysor weeks of high\nmotivation to daysor weeks of low motivation.But before we do that, we\nneed to take a step backand acknowledge that, just as\nwith anxiety, or happiness,or sadness, we as human beings\ndon't have an objective windowinto how other people\nexperience motivation.In fact, most of the\ntime, we don't evenrealize how we\nexperience motivation.We just know whether\nor not we feela high barrier or a low\nbarrier to leaning into workand getting things done.In fact, I have\na good friend whodid many years in the\nspecial operations community,and then went on to\nthe finance community,and then now works in health\nand wellness community.He has a great mental image\nfor all of us to adopt.It's certainly one that\nI've adopted, which is--for anything in our\nlife, we can eitherbe back on our heels,\nflat footed, or forwardcenter of mass.Back in our heels, meaning\nreally struggling; flat footed,meaning we're doing OK;\nor forward center of mass,meaning that we feel as if\nwe're really tackling thingsand that we are in\ncontrol of our environmentor at least to some degree.So I place that\nimagery in your mindbecause I'll return to\nit a little bit laterin the question when\nwe get into someof the underlying\ncircuitry and tools.In the meantime, I want\nto remind everybody whatthe basis of motivation is.There are many neurochemicals\nand neural circuits involvedin what we call motivation,\nbut a central themeof the neuroscience\nof motivationis that the neural modulator\ndopamine is involved.Now, dopamine does other things\nbesides control motivation.In fact, it controls\nlight adaptationin the retina, that is your eye.It controls a number\nof different thingsin terms of movement.It controls all sorts of things,\nbut it is strongly relatedto the motivation pathways.How do we know that?Well, there are experiments\non animals and humans, whichshow that even in the\nabsence of dopamine,or in the presence of very\nlow dopamine, I should say,people and animals can\nstill experience pleasure.However, when dopamine\nlevels are too low,people's ability\nto pursue pleasure,or their willingness to pursue\npleasure, in particular,their willingness to undergo\neffort to pursue pleasureor any goal of any\nkind, not just pleasure,any goal of any\nkind, is stronglyregulated by the\nlevels of dopamine.So if dopamine\nlevels are too low,people simply will\nnot put in the effortto obtain or reach a goal.If dopamine levels\nare adequately high,they will put in that effort.And if dopamine\nlevels go too high,you actually see something\nthat is pathologic,which is that people consider\nevery goal a reasonable goal.This is often seen in the\nmanic phase of a manic bipolarperson.So for instance, somebody\nwith manic bipolarwho is in a manic\nepisode, dopamine levelsare very, very high,\nand they will thinkevery idea is a great idea.And they will have tons\nof energy to do that,so much so so that\nthey're not sleeping.So obviously, that's\nnot what we want.What we want, and what the\nquestion asker, Martin,is asking about, is how to keep\ndopamine levels in a range thatallow us to lean into effort\nbut that we don't expendour ability to stay motivated.And we can really\ntrace that backto a biochemical/neural\ncircuit statement, whichis-- we really want to\ncontrol our output of dopamineand the baseline\nlevels of dopaminefrom which that output is taken.In other words, we want to think\nabout dopamine as a reservoiror residing in a reservoir.That reservoir can be\ndepleted, so it's exhaustible,it's depletable, but\nit's renewable as well.And one of the best analogies\nthat I've ever heardwas by a previous guest on the\nHuberman Lab podcast, Dr. KyleGillett, who's a medical doctor,\nobesity specialist, expertin hormones.We did an episode on\noptimizing hormonesin males with Dr. Kyle Gillett.You can find that at\nhubermanlab.com or anywhereyou can find podcasts.Dr. Gillett offered an\nanalogy of the baseline levelsof dopamine as a wave pool,\nand I really like this.So if you think about this pool\nfull of dopamine-- and herewe're just talking\nabout the dopaminethat resides in the\ncircuits of the brain thatcontrol motivation.But that pool of dopamine\nyou could imagineis just sitting there not\ndoing much of anythingwhile you're asleep.In fact, while you're\nsleeping, you'rereplenishing those\ndopamine levels.I'll tell you another\ntool in a momentto replenish those\ndopamine levels.But if you were\nto pursue a goal,really, really go\nforward-center of massfor many, many hours or many,\nmany days, in some cases,and pursue a goal\nor multiple goalsand you're really driven to do\na ton, what you're effectivelydoing is generating\nwaves in that wave pool.And if those waves\nare too big, well,then the waves can't keep\nrepeating themselves.So think about the\nwave as the motivationand the depth of the pool is\nthe reservoir of dopamine.And if those waves are too\nbig, too much excitement, toomuch motivation, too\nmuch center of massfor a given period of time,\nthen the water in this wave poolsloshes out of the wave\npool lowering the reservoir.And then there are\nreally three waysthat you can replenish\nthat reservoir,and you want to maintain\nor replenish that reservoirif it's been depleted.How do you do that?Well, first of\nall, quality sleep.So when I say\nquality, I mean whereyou're getting enough slow\nwave sleep and rapid Imove in sleep.So for some people, six hours,\nfor some people, eight hours.Some people might even\nneed a little bit moreor a little bit less.We have episodes-- the\nPerfect Your Sleep episode,the Master Your Sleep episode.We have a toolkit for sleep.All available at zero\ncost at hubermanlab.com,links et cetera.So check those out for\ngetting your sleep right.But sleep is really\nwhen you replenishthat reservoir of dopamine.So you cannot ignore sleep.I'll come back to\nthis in a moment.The second science\nsupported toolthat's really been\nshown to replenishdopamine, in particular,\ndopamine within the pathwaysthat regulate motivation, is\na practice I've talked aboutbefore on the podcast\ncalled non-sleep deep rest,sometimes called yoga nidra,\nalthough, yoga nidra isa little bit different.There are two studies\nout of Denmarkthat have explored yoga nidra\nin the context of dopamine.The first one simply involved\nhaving people do a yoga nidrapractice.Again, this doesn't\ninvolve any movement,but it involves people,\npotentially you,doing anywhere from 30 to 60\nminutes, although there are nowdata showing that as\nshort as 10 minutesof a non-sleep deep rest,\na.k.a. yoga nidra protocol,leads to dramatic,\nreally dramatic increasesin striatal dopamine reserves.So it essentially\nis replenishingthe dopamine reserve pool.This is why I'm such a\nfan of using NSDR, a.k.a.yoga nidra, at least once a\nday and especially under timeswhen you're engaging in\na lot of high output.And when I say,\nespecially at timeswhen you're engaging in\na lot of high output,this is a mistake\nmany people make.They push, push,\npush, push, push.They're in pursuit of a goal.Then they hit that point\nwhere they're exhausted.Then they start doing\nall the dopamine reservepool replenishing tools\nsuch as yoga nidra or NSDR.The real key is\nto always tap offthat or refill that\nreservoir once a daybefore it's completely depleted.Now, this gets into some of\nthe biochemistry of dopamineand the relevant circuits,\nbut it takes a lot longerto restore the\ndopamine reservoir--think of it still\nas a wave pool,but that reservoir from a\nplace of complete depletionthen it does of\npartial depletion.So there's an asymmetry\nin the way this is done.So it's not as if you\ndrink a glass of water.You fill the glass of\nwater at a certain rateand it fills up to\na certain level,and the rate is constant.Think about it as once the level\nof dopamine in your reserveis depleted past\na certain point,it takes a lot more effort,\nmuch more sleep, much more NSDR,things of that sort to\nreplenish that reservoir.Now, oftentimes\nwhat people will dowhen they start\nfeeling less motivationis they will start relying\non things like Adderall,Ritalin, some cases\nillegal substances thatcan increase dopamine.You know what those are.Please don't ever\nlean in to those.They are extremely dangerous.They really are because\nof their abilityto potently release dopamine.And guess what, deplete\nthat reservoir even further.We've talked about\nsome supplementson the podcast that\ncan replenish dopamine,L-tyrosine in particular.Mucuna pruriens is\nactually 99% l-DOPA,the precursor to dopamine.I don't necessarily\nrecommend Mucuna pruriens.It tends to make people\nvery dopaminergic--drive, drive, drive, drive,\nmotivated, and then crash.Again, depleting that pool.L-tyrosine is a\nlittle bit milder.But I really encourage\npeople to lean firston the behavioral\ntools such as an NSDR.And by the way, there's a NSDR\nscript, totally zero cost,that you can find by putting\nmy name and NSDR into YouTube.That one works quite well if you\nare looking for a short NSDR.There are some other NSDRs.You can simply look on\nthe internet or YouTubeand just put NSDR\nand you'll find NSDR.Or if you prefer to do\nthe more classic yoganidra type approach, there are\na lot of different yoga nidraoptions to choose\nfrom on YouTube.Many people think NSDR\nor yoga nidra are simplymeditation with a body scan.That's not true.Meditation is a focus exercise.Most meditations\nare focus exercise.NSDR restores energy\nthrough the dopamine system,and newer data are\nstarting to showthat it can actually\nrecover lost sleep,so if you're not\nsleeping enough.But to return to NSDR, a.k.a.\nyoga nidra, as a practice,yes, it's been shown in\nlaboratory studies, in humans,by the way, to restore\ndopamine levels.There's another\nstudy, lesser known,from that same group that\nwas published in 2011,which is entitled Dopaminergic\nstimulation enhances confidenceand accuracy in seeing\nrapidly presented words.This was a cognitive task.They explored yoga nedra, a.k.a.NSDR, in the context of\nincreasing striatal dopamine.They already knew that it\ndid that, so that's great.They confirmed that result.\nBut what they also foundis that doing NSDR could restore\nconfidence in cognitive abilityand performance in\nthese cognitive tasks.So this is a really\npowerful, zero costtool for re-upping\nor replenishingthat dopamine reserve.So this is something to do every\nday, especially when you're notfeeling depleted.So the question,\nagain, was about howto make sure that you don't\ngo through these cyclesof extreme motivation and\nthen lesser motivation.Well, get your sleep right.I always say, 80% or more\nof the nights of your life,hopefully the nights that it's\nnot good, are for good reasonsthat you're enjoying yourself.But hey, life happens,\nso 100% of the timeit's just not reasonable\nto expect of yourself.Do NSDR once a day\nfor either 10 minutes.If you have the time to do\n20-30 minutes or an hour,you will see even\nmore positive effects.It has been shown in\nthese research studiesto replenish dopamine,\nlevels of confidence,cognitive ability, et cetera,\nand sense of motivation.And I said there\nwere three tools,and the third tool\nthat really canallow you to keep the\ndopamine, a.k.a. motivationcircuitry, tuned up\nproperly is to really startpaying attention to\npeaks in dopamineand be very careful\nabout layeringin too many things that can\nstimulate the dopamine system.I talked about this quite\na bit in the episodethat we did on ADHD and\nbuilding and maintaining focus.There are many things\nout there nowadaysthat will deplete\nthe dopamine system.For instance-- and by the way,\nnone of what I'm about to listis necessarily bad.I actually used some\nof these things.For instance, caffeine will\nincrease dopamine receptorsthat will allow\nwhatever dopamineis available to be more potent.OK, so caffeine is\ngreat for some people,less good for\npeople with anxiety.Don't drink it too\nlate in the daybecause it will interfere\nwith your sleep,and so on and so forth.But many people will\ncombine caffeine with musicthat they particularly like.Music's great.Music can stimulate dopamine\nrelease, we know this.It can enhance\nmotivation, especiallyif is the kind of music\nthat really puts youin the groove for the\nparticular type of workyou're going to do.For me, I like to listen to\neither loud fast music or GlennGould classical piano,\nso one or the other.I know what's right for\nme for a given time.You'll know what's right\nfor you for a giventime and your preferences.But what will happen is people\nwill start consuming caffeineat higher and higher levels.Again, caffeine isn't\nnecessarily bad,but they'll start doing that.And they'll start layering\nit in, or stacking,very potent music,\npotent for them,plus things like L-tyrosine.Again, none of these things\nare terrible on their own.In fact, they can\nbe very beneficial.Sometimes they'll start\ntaking Mucuna pruriens.Sometimes they'll\nstart relying on thingslike Adderall, Ritalin.And pretty soon\nwhat's happening isthey're getting these big waves\nin that dopamine wave pool,big peaks.And within a few days or\nmaybe even within a few hours,they're depleted and\nthey're at that low.And then, as Dr.\nAnna Lembke, whois a guest on the podcast,\ntalked about in termsof addiction but also in\nher wonderful book DopamineNation, what happens is after\nthose big peaks in dopamine,the reservoir, the\nbaseline in dopamine,drops below its initial level.So it's as if the reservoir\ngot deeper, and it's emptier,and it takes much,\nmuch longer to fill.So to be quite specific,\nwhat I'm recommendingis get your sleep right.Ideally, every night of\nyour life, but for asmany nights of your\nlife as possible.That's clearly replenishing\ndopamine and senseof motivation.Do all the things associated\nwith that-- morning, sunlight,lack of artificial\nlight at certain hoursof the night, et cetera.All of that's in the Toolkit\nfor Sleep and other episodesI mentioned before.Have a practice that\nis research supportedto replenish dopamine,\nand incorporatethat practice any time of day.Again, NSDR can be done\nmorning, afternoon, or evening,or middle of the\nnight if you wake upand you need to\nget back to sleep,it can be very\nbeneficial for that.But do it as a\nconsistent practiceso that dopamine reservoir\nremains tapped off.And as a third point, please be\nwary of, or at least aware of,these peaks in\ndopamine and the factthat layering in a lot of things\nthat stimulate dopamine, well,that can be wonderful for your\nwedding, birth of a new child,going to a sports event\nwith a bunch of friends,celebrating a big anniversary.Yes, please do\ncelebrate and enjoythe wonderful events of life,\nbut please also understandand expect there will be a\nlull, a sort of postpartum low,maybe not full blown\ndepression, thatfollows that unless\nyou incorporatesome tools and practices\nto replenish that dopamine.Does that mean you should never\ncombine caffeine, L-tyrosine,music, and a workout,\nand time with friends?No, absolutely not.But don't expect to\ndo that, and thengo do an intense bout\nof work, and then get upthe next morning and do\nit all over again for morethan a few days before you\nfind yourself pretty depleted.So rather than give\nyou a specific scheduleof do seven days of this\nand four days of this, whatI encourage you to do is, for at\nleast five days a week-- maybegive yourself some time off\non the weekends, maybe not.But for at least\nfive days a week,get into a consistent\nroutine thatis, I should say,\nneurobiologically consistent aswell with how the\ndopamine, a.k.a.circuits that control\nmotivation, work.And I assure you that\nyou will find yourselfin a more regular groove\nof focus, and attention,and alertness, and\nmotivation when you need to.And provided you're\ndoing all the thingsI described, and\nhopefully paying attentionto other things like nutrition\nand social connection too,of course, you'll find a much\nmore even pattern of motivationover time.One last thing before I conclude\nthe answer to this question.When I was in graduate school,\nI got some wonderful advicefrom an excellent neurologist.His name is Robert Knight.He used to be at University\nof California, Berkeley.I think he's retired\nnow but is stillactive in the\nscientific community.And I asked him what he\nwas doing that weekend.I don't know why this came up.And he said, oh,\nI'm going fishing.I like mindless recreation.I said, that's great.You know, fishing is fun.I'm not particularly\ninto fishing myself,but I've done it a few\ntimes and I enjoy it.And he said, the most important\nthing for a science or medicinecareer or any demanding career?I said, what?I was all ears, super\nhungry to get in the mixand do research\nand publish papers.And he said, figure out\nhow many hours a day youcan do real work consistently.That means five days a week,\nfor some people six or seven,but five days a week I\nthink for most peopleis going to be a bit healthier\noverall for your social lifeand family, et cetera.And he said, figure\nthat out, and knowthat that number is what you\nshould apply over, and over,and over again, but update that\nnumber about every four or fiveyears.And I said, OK, so does that\nmean that over time I'm workingmore and more or less and less?And he said, ah, here's the\ndeal-- as you get betterat your profession,\nyou will findthat you can do more potent\nwork, more directed work,in a shorter amount\nof time, but thatdoes not mean that\nyou can continueto expand the amount of time\nthat you're doing focused work.In fact, the opposite.So this follows a sort\nof general principlethat's also present in\nresistance training,weightlifting, right?The analogy there is\nthat people alwaysimagine that as you get better\nand better at resistancetraining that you should\ndo more and more volume,just keep adding volume.And there's some\nevidence to support that.More volume for hypertrophy\nas opposed to less, et cetera.We've done episodes on this.However, there's a\ndifferent school of thoughtthat works exceedingly\nwell, and itruns in the exact\nopposite direction,which is as you get better\nat controlling muscularcontractions--or let's say for in\nan endurance sport,as you get better at regulating\nyour stride, and breathing,and all those\nthings, you actuallycan do more \"adaptation\"\nstimulating damageduring a given training session.So you want to train\nless not more over timebecause beginners don't\nactually have the abilityto get much done in a lot of\ntime or a short period of time,whereas, experts can come\nin there and really nail it.So I think that advice that\nRobert Knight was really key,and it's something that I've\nfollowed throughout my career.So at one period of my life,\nI won't mention the hoursthat I worked in\ngraduate school,they were pretty\ninsane to be honest.I had family members\nget a little concerned.I actually lived\nin the laboratoryeven as a junior professor.I don't suggest people\ndo that by the way,but I enjoyed it at the time.And the key thing is\nthat you figure outwhat you can do consistently\nand still maintain mental healthand physical health.That's key as well.And do that, and then,\nevery couple of years or so,update that,\ntypically, by reducingthe total amount\nof time that you'redoing that high-potency work.I think that, combined\nwith the other toolsthat I described\nbefore for generatingongoing dopaminergic circuits,\nkeeping that reservoir full,ought to give you\nconsistent motivation.Again, it's an art, and a\npractice, and a science,so don't expect to get it\nperfect the first time around.But I wish you all luck, and I'm\ncertain that these tools work.Thank you for joining\nfor the beginning of thisask me anything episode.To hear the full episode and to\nhear future episodes of theseask me anything sessions, plus\nto receive transcripts of themand transcripts of the Huberman\nLab podcast standard channeland premium tools not\nreleased anywhere else,please go to\nhubermanlab.com/premium.Just to remind you why we\nlaunched the Huberman Labpodcast premium channel,\nit's really twofold.First of all, it's\nto raise supportfor the standard Huberman\nLab podcast channel, which,of course, will still be\ncontinued to be releasedevery Monday in full length.We are not going to\nchange the formator anything about the\nstandard Huberman Lab podcast.And to fund research.In particular, research done\non human beings, so not animalmodels but on\nhuman beings, whichI think we all\nagree as a speciesthat we are most interested in.And we are going to\nspecifically fundresearch that is aimed\ntoward developingfurther protocols for mental\nhealth, physical health,and performance.And those protocols\nwill be distributedthrough all channels.Not just the premium channel\nbut through all channels--Huberman Lab podcast and\nother media channels.So the idea here is to give\nyou information to your burningquestions in depth and\nallow you the opportunityto support the kind\nof research thatprovides those kinds of\nanswers in the first place.Now, and especially exciting\nfeature of the premium channelis that the tiny\nfoundation has generouslyoffered to do dollar-for-dollar\nmatch on all funds raisedfor research through\nthe premium channel.So this is a terrific\nway that they'regoing to amplify whatever funds\ncome in through the premiumchannel to further support\nresearch for scienceand science related tools for\nmental health, physical health,and performance.If you'd like to sign up for the\nHuberman Lab premium channel,again, there's a cost\nof $10 per month,or you can pay $100 up\nfront for the entire year.That will give you\naccess to all the AMA's.You can ask questions and get\nanswers to your questions,and you'll, of course, get\nanswers to all the questionsthat other people ask as well.There will also be some premium\ncontent such as transcriptsof the AMA's and various\ntranscripts and protocolsof Huberman lab podcast\nepisodes not found elsewhere.And again, you'll be\nsupporting researchfor mental health, physical\nhealth, and performance.You can sign up for the\npremium channel by goingto hubermanlab.com/premium.Again, that's\nhubermanlab.com/premium.And as always, thank you for\nyour interest in science.[MUSIC PLAYING]"
