            "text": "to answering your questions.The first question\nis about nature,in particular about the\nscientifically-supportedbenefits of getting\noutdoors into nature.The person asks about\nthe role of sunlight,the role of calming\nsounds, the roleof observing wildlife, of\nobserving green colors,and, quote, \"other stuff.\"And in fact, I'm glad that\nthey asked about \"other stuff\"because I get the question about\nthe scientifically-supportedbenefits of nature a lot.I often also get the\nquestion about grounding.For those of you that aren't\nfamiliar with what groundingis, grounding is a practice of\nputting your feet on the Earthdirectly with bare\nfeet, oftentimesinto soil or on a lawn.And it's a question that I\nseem to get more and more.In fact, every week for quite a\nlong while now, on social mediaor elsewhere, somebody asks me\nabout the scientific supportfor this practice of grounding.So obviously there's\na lot of interestin what the scientific research\nsays about getting into natureand putting one's\nfeet on the ground,a.k.a. grounding, and so on.OK, so if I'm going to\nanswer this question,I first have to be\nvery direct with you.There is excellent,\nmeaning dozens, if nothundreds, of quality\npeer-reviewed studies whichsupport the value of getting\nsunlight in one's eyes,in particular early in the day\nto set your circadian rhythm.This is something that I've\ntalked about extensivelyon the Huberman Lab podcast and\nas a guest on other podcasts.It's one of the first and,\nfrankly, most importantitems on the toolkit for sleep,\nwhich is a zero-cost toolkitthat you can access by\ngoing to hubermanlab.com,going to the menu,\ngoing to Newsletter.You can see it as a PDF there.You don't have to sign\nup for the newsletter.You can just access\nthat toolkit for sleep.And you'll notice that very\nclose to the top of that list,if not top of that list, is\nto get sunlight in your eyesearly in the day.You don't have to see the\nsun cross the horizon.If you can, that's great.But if you wake up after\nthe sun has alreadyrisen, go outside,\nface the sun, blinkas necessary to\nprotect your eyes,but get some sunlight\ninto your eyesevery single day or as\noften as you possibly can,especially on overcast days.That's an absolutely\nunequivocallyscience-supported tool that will\nincrease daytime mood, focus,and alertness and will\nimprove your nighttime sleep.Viewing morning sunlight also\nhas profoundly positive effectson metabolism.Now, those effects\non metabolism couldbe the direct effect of viewing\nsunlight or, more likely,they are the\nindirect consequenceof getting better\nsleep at night.So getting sunlight in\nyour eyes early in the dayand ideally in the\nevening or late afternoonbefore the sun sets is a\nvery well supported protocolthat we know is beneficial\nfor numerous aspectsof mental health, physical\nhealth, and performance.And of course, sunlight and\ngetting sunlight in one's eyesdoes require that\nyou get outside.You simply will not\nderive the same benefitsfrom viewing sunlight\nif you try and do itthrough a window or\nwindshield or if youlook at a picture of\na sun on a screen.Forget it.You are not going to set\nyour circadian rhythm.You are not going to derive\nall the positive effectsof sunlight by trying\nto get it from screensor from looking at pictures of\nsuns or something of that sort.Now, if you are somebody\nthat, for whatever reason--seasonality, where you live on\nthe planet, work schedule, etcetera--who cannot get sunlight in\nyour eyes early in the dayon a consistent basis, well,\nthen you might considerpurchasing a so-called SAD lamp,\nwhich is for seasonal affectivedisorder, which is very\nbright light that you can lookat in the morning for usually\nabout 5 to 10 minutes.People will put it\non their counterwhile they make their morning\ncoffee, eat their breakfast.And that has also been shown\nto improve mood, focus,and alertness and set\none's circadian rhythm.But it is not nearly as\neffective as getting sunlightin your eyes.Now, why am I talking\nabout this practicethat I've already\ntalked about extensivelyon numerous podcasts before?Well, because the\nquestion is about nature,and sunlight is a key feature\nof our natural environment.But the person is also\nasking about other featuresof nature-- seeing green\ncolors, or blue colors,or running streams\nfor that matter.Well, here, too, we can ask,\nwhat does the scientific datareally say about\nthings like goingnear a waterfall, or a running\nstream, or being near an ocean?And actually, this\nis quite interesting.There is actually a\npeer-reviewed literatureon negative ionization,\nas it's called,which is a pattern\nof ionization that'spresent close to bodies of water\nand particular types of bodiesof water, such as waterfalls,\nrunning streams, et cetera.There's actually a laboratory\nat Columbia University Schoolof Medicine that has\npublished fairly extensivelyon the health benefits\nof negative ionizationas it relates to\nsetting circadianrhythm and some other aspects\nof mental and physical health.I intend to host the\nhead of that laboratoryon the Huberman Lab podcast\nin the not too distant future.For now, we can\nsafely say this--there does seem to be\nsome positive healthbenefits to placing oneself\nnear bodies of water,in particular moving\nbodies of water.And of course, as is always\nthe case when there'sa discovery about how the\nnatural world can impacthealth, there have been\nsome technologies developedto create negative\npatterns of ionizationwithin a home environment.But as with viewing\nsunlight exposureand comparing it\nto, say, SAD lamps,the negative ionization machines\nthat one can purchase and putin their home environment have\nbeen shown in a few studiesto produce some positive\nhealth benefits.But those positive\neffects in no wayreach the level of\npositive effectsthat have been demonstrated\nin studies where peopleare actually\nspending a dedicatedperiod of time outdoors as\nnear a moving body of water.So in thinking about nature,\nnatural environments,there's strong evidence for\ngetting sunlight in one's eyes.There is some evidence for being\nnear moving bodies of water,perhaps--again, I really want\nto highlight perhaps--because of negative ionization\ncreated by those movingbodies of water.There is far less evidence\nfor sunlight simulatorsor negative ionization\nmachines used indoors.And then the asker of this\nquestion also, quite correctly,asked about things\nlike calming sounds,watching wildlife,\ngreen colors, et cetera.And herein lies a really\nimportant point for everyoneto digest.While, of course,\nanswering a questionabout the natural\nworld or about healthrequires that we first pose a\nhypothesis-- for those of youthat aren't familiar\nwhat a hypothesis is,a hypothesis is a\nstated prediction.So it's not a question.A question would\nbe something like,is getting out into nature\ngood for our health?A scientific hypothesis is where\none actually takes a stance.For instance, you\ncould take the stanceand make the hypothesis\nthat getting outinto nature for 30 minutes\nper day, three days per week,improves mood and\nnighttime sleep.So that's a hypothesis\nthat then one would go onto design an experiment\nto test and then evaluatethe data from that\nexperiment and compare itto the hypothesis, either\nvalidating or negatingthat hypothesis.That's essentially\nhow science is done.There's a lot more to it,\nbut that's essentiallythe scientific method.And while, of course,\nthe scientific methodis a fabulously powerful\ntool, for some questions,it is a less potent tool.And the question of is\ngetting out into naturehelpful for enhancing our\nmental and physical health isthe sort of question\nthat while ideally youcould design a really well\ncontrolled study to address,it's actually quite difficult\nto design such a study.And here's why.In order to perform a study\nthat's very well controlled,meaning where you can isolate\nindividual variables--like sunlight, like the sorts\nof color contrast that one seesin a natural scene outdoors\nin a forest or near a river--in order to address\nwhether or notthe calming sounds or the\npresence of squirrels runningthrough your environment\nare the relevant factors,it becomes incredibly\ndifficult to try and isolateindividual variables, meaning\nas soon as you bring peopleinto the laboratory, yes, you\nhave more control over whichvariables, as they're\ncalled, you present them,by bringing them into a\nroom that essentially hasno art on the walls and\nthen having them lookat a picture of a sun\nor looking at sunlightor listening to soothing\nsounds or lookingat a picture of a\nforest, of course,you're controlling the\nindividual variables.However, there is\na sort of gestalt,meaning a collective\npicture of beingin nature that\nbrings together lotsof different elements--\nthe element of surprise,for instance.The other day I was\nout for a Sunday hike,and that morning I\nsaw a squirrel runningacross my path, and\nit was interestingbecause the squirrel had\na pinecone in its mouth.It had been chewed\ndown to the cob.And the squirrel was probably\nonly about 7 or 8 inches long,and the pine cone was probably\nabout 9 or 10 inches long--the cob of the\npine cone, that is.And the interesting thing\nis that the squirrelwas carrying it long ways\nfrom the tip of the cob.And so I delighted in the\nfact that this little squirrelwas working so hard to carry\nthis object through the woods.And this object was literally\nlonger than its own bodylength, and it looked so\ndedicated in its runningacross the path in\norder to do whatever itwould with that pine cone cob.So something like that\nobviously stuck in my memory.It delighted me.And at the very same\ntime, there were a numberof other things happening\nbesides the presenceof that novel\nwildlife experience.There was the sound of a stream.There's the sunlight.There's the color\ncontrast everywhere.I'm breathing\nfresh air because Iwas far away from any cars\nor any civilization, in fact.And so here's what we know.There are dozens,\nif not hundreds,of studies that show\nthat if people get outof doors into nature--this could be parks.This could be near a stream.This could be an\nocean, any numberof different natural\nenvironments.And if they do that for\nanywhere from 10 to 30 minutes,three to seven days\nper week, indeed thereare demonstrated\nsignificant reductionsin things like blood\npressure, resting heartrate, improvements in\nsleep, improvements in mood.And so I think we can very\nreliably say that, yes,or perhaps even absolutely yes,\ngetting outside into naturecan enhance various aspects of\nmental health, physical health,and thereby performance in\ndifferent aspects of life.However, when talking\nabout the benefitsof getting into nature, we are\ntalking about hundreds, if notthousands, of variables, some\nof which we are aware of,such as the presence of wildlife\nor sunlight or color contrast.And then, of course,\nthere are goingto be dozens, if not\nhundreds, maybe eventhousands of other variables\nthat we're not even aware of.Perhaps it's\nnegative ionization.Most people aren't measuring\nthe ionization of the airwhen they go out into nature.But perhaps it's\nalso the presenceof certain smells from the\nsoils that are being broken downand then they're changing the\noxygenation state of the airaround you, the\nplants, et cetera.Again, so many\nvariables, that, frankly,to try and isolate any\none of those variablesin the laboratory seems\nnot just artificial,but I think that it\nactually would justlead to a diminished sense of\njust how valuable nature is.So while, of course,\nthe Huberman Lab podcastis a podcast where\nwe always centeron science and\nscience-related tools,meaning protocols\nthat are groundedin quality peer-reviewed\nstudies that have been subjectedto control conditions where\nsome people are getting,say, the drug treatment\nor taking the supplementor doing a particular behavioral\npractice and other peopleare not or doing some variant of\nthose and dose response curves,all of that stuff, when it\ncomes to the question ofwhether or not it's valuable\nto get out into nature,I think it's a very\nstraightforward yes.Absolutely yes.Get out into nature as often\nas you can and safely can,of course.I realize some of this\nis weather permitting.People live in different areas.Some people are in cities.Some people are in deserts.Some people are near the ocean.But getting out into nature has\nbeen shown over and over againto have numerous\npositive health effects.And yet, unless we're talking\nabout sunlight exposureand isolating the variable\nof setting one's circadianrhythm by viewing sunlight\nearly in the day, allof the other features of\ngetting out into nature,things like forest bathing--this is a term coined from some,\nfrankly, pretty nice studiesthat were done in Japan in\nwhich people placed themselvesinto forest-like environments\nfor a certain period of time.There were control groups\nwhere people were notplaced into those\nenvironments, and the peoplethat did this so-called\nforest bathing experiencedenhanced mental and\nphysical health.That brought on a practice of\npeople who could not get outof doors into forests\nbringing plantsinto their home environment,\nwhich I think all of uswould agree look nice.They often will add\npleasant odors to the air,and perhaps they do actually\nshift our mental and physicalhealth in significant ways.I suppose it depends on\nhow much you like plants,how much you pay attention\nto them, and, of course,how many plants there are.But-- and I think this\nis a really important\"but\" to emphasize--while most all questions\nabout tools and protocolsfor enhancing health\nimmediately lead me to say, ah,this study or that\nstudy or, yes,there's evidence or, no, there\nisn't evidence, when it comesto questions about nature\nand grounding in particular,I take the stance that this\nis a unique instance wherewe know there are just so\nmany benefits of getting outinto nature that\ntrying to isolateany one of those\nvariables in a quality,rigorous way within\nthe laboratoryalmost seems too artificial\nto really justifythe conclusions that arrive.Now, I'm sure there are some of\nyou out there who are aware--and if you're not,\nI'll tell you-- thereare studies that have\nexplored this practiceof so-called grounding.They've had people come\ninto the laboratoryand place their feet on soil\nthat is contained within a boxor there are other studies\nwhere they actuallyhave people go out of\ndoors and place their feetonto the grass or the ground.And there are a\nbunch of theoriesas to how grounding\ncould improveone's mental and physical health\nthat aren't just about gettingoutside.So the theories go\nthat this has to dowith the exchange of\nelectrons with the Earthand the Earth's\nsurface in particular.There's been the\nargument made that shoes,in particular shoes\nthat have rubber soles,may block some of\nthis electron exchangewith the surface of the Earth.There have been theories\nabout the tactile--that is, the touch sensation--\nwith the Earth being important.Not a lot of science\npublished in, let's just say,blue ribbon journals,\nwhich is notto diminish some of the journals\nthat these have been publishedin, but just to say that, again,\nthere are so many variablesassociated with a practice such\nas grounding that I'll simplysay, yes, please do get\nout of doors into nature.I try every Sunday to do my zone\n2 cardio by rucking or joggingor hiking, often\nwith other peopleif I'm trying to be social\nwith family or others.But the point is\ngetting out of doorshas myriad positive\neffects on mental healthand physical health.And of course, when you're\nmoving out of doors,you're also getting that\nzone 2 cardio or other formsof physical benefit by\nelevating your heart rateor perhaps you could even do\nyour resistance training outof doors on other days.Now, I also try to get out of\ndoors other days of the week.But oftentimes, I'm,\nby way of weatheror by way of other commitments,\nforced to be indoors,on planes, here at\nthe podcast studiowhere certainly I'm indoors.But I try and get out of\ndoors at least a few minuteseach day for a morning stroll,\nlooking at sunlight, et cetera.So the long and short\nof this is, yes, there'ssome evidence for grounding.Is it super strong evidence?No, it's not.We don't really know what it\nis about placing one's feetonto the Earth that is producing\nthe positive effects thatwere observed in those studies.And those studies made\nsome reasonable attemptto isolate the variables and\nfigure out whether or notit was ion exchange with\nthe Earth or the tactile,meaning the touch\nsensation, of havingone's feet on the ground.Frankly, I don't think\nthere's enough quality scienceto really draw any firm\nconclusions about that.However, if you like the idea of\ngrounding, by all means, do it.In fact, if it\nfeels good to you,I recommend getting your\nmorning sunlight outof doors with your bare\nfeet on the ground.Or if you're like me,\nyou put on your shoes,and you take a walk most days.Although, I've tried this\npractice of grounding,and it feels pretty\ngood, meaningit feels nice to have\nmy feet on the Earth,provided I'm on clean\nsoil or clean lawn.Definitely don't do\nthis at the dog park.Hookworm is a real\nthing, by the way, folks.So pay attention to\nthe sorts of surfacesthat you're putting\nyour feet onto.But the question about\nwhether or not natureis valuable for our mental and\nphysical health is an easy one.It's an absolute yes.But isolating the particular\nvariables about naturethat are most beneficial, well,\nthat's a much tougher question,and it's one that, frankly,\nthe scientific method is notand, to be honest,\nI don't think everwill be in a position\nto isolate and reallynail down specifically, because\nas soon as you get specificabout that question,\nyou start to diminishthe value of the study itself.So the long and short of\nthis is get out into natureas often as you safely can.If you can exercise out\nof doors, even better.If you want to make\nit social, great.If you don't want to\nmake it social, fine.It's your life.It's up to you.But there certainly is value\nin getting out into nature.It's also just beautiful\nfrom a visual perspective,from an auditory perspective.And I myself try and take at\nleast a few trips each year.None of these are\nparticularly expensive tripswhere I try and get\nout hiking, camping.The weekly walks in nature\nare an absolute must for me.If I miss one because of\nweather conditions or travel,I make it a point to\ntry and get into naturemore during the following\nweek or whenever I can.And frankly, I don't have\na scientific explanationfor why nature is\noh-so beneficial,except for the sunlight piece\nand perhaps this groundingpiece and the negative\nionization piece.And frankly, I\ndon't worry so muchabout the lack of\nvariable-isolating, quality,peer-reviewed studies that\nsupport the benefits of gettingout into nature.I simply like getting\nout into natureand into different\nnatural environmentsas much as I possibly can,\nbecause, for whatever reason,imagine those reasons have\nsomething to do with serotonin,dopamine, hormones,\noxytocin, probablya bunch of different\nthings that arerooted in how our\nnervous system evolvedin natural environments.Well, it just feels really good.Thank you for joining\nfor the beginningof this Ask Me Anything episode.To hear the full episode and to\nhear future episodes of theseAsk Me Anything sessions, plus\nto receive transcripts of themand transcripts of the Huberman\nLab podcast standard channeland premium tools not\nreleased anywhere else,please go to\nhubermanlab.com/premium.Just to remind you why we\nlaunched the Huberman Labpodcast premium channel,\nit's really twofold.First of all, it's\nto raise supportfor the standard Huberman\nLab podcast channel, which,of course, will still be\ncontinued to be releasedevery Monday in full length.We are not going to\nchange the formator anything about the\nstandard Huberman Lab podcast.And to fund research--\nin particular, researchdone on human beings,\nso not animal models,but on human beings,\nwhich I think we all agreeis a species that we\nare most interested in.And we are going to\nspecifically one research thatis aimed toward developing\nfurther protocolsfor mental health, physical\nhealth, and performance.And those protocols\nwill be distributedthrough all channels, not\njust the premium channel,but through all channels,\nHuberman Lab podcastand other media channels.So the idea here is to give\nyou information to your burningquestions in depth and\nallow you the opportunityto support the kind\nof research thatprovides those kinds of\nanswers in the first place.Now, an especially exciting\nfeature of the premium channelis that the Tiny\nFoundation has generouslyoffered to do dollar-for-dollar\nmatch on all funds raisedfor research through\nthe premium channel.So this is a terrific\nway that they'regoing to amplify whatever funds\ncome in through the premiumchannel to further support\nresearch for scienceand science-related tools for\nmental health, physical health,and performance.If you'd like to sign up for the\nHuberman Lab Premium channel,again, there's a cost\nof $10 per month,or you can pay $100 up\nfront for the entire year.That will give you\naccess to all the AMAs.You can ask questions and get\nanswers to your questions.And you'll, of course, get\nanswers to all the questionsthat other people ask as well.There will also be some premium\ncontent, such as transcriptsof the AMAs and various\ntranscripts and protocolsof Huberman Lab podcast\nepisodes not found elsewhere.And again, you'll be\nsupporting researchfor mental health, physical\nhealth, and performance.You can sign up for the\npremium channel by goingto hubermanlab.com/premium.Again, that's\nhubermanlab.com/premium.And as always, thank you for\nyour interest in science.[MUSIC PLAYING]"
