but for mostpeople I believe that enhancing one'slevel of tenacity and willpower would beadvantageous now you'll be relieved toknow that while there are a nearinfinite number of differentcircumstances where one would need todraw on tenacity and willpower in orderto succeed there is one major mechanismwithin the brain indeed one majormechanism by which tenacity and willowerare generated and it arrives through theactivation of a particular brain centerthat is a hub but that is it lies at theinterface of many other neural circuitsand has input from all the criticalneural circuits that one would need inorder to generate tenacity and willpowernow we are going to return to thatparticular neural circuit a little bitlater after we talk about the psychologyof willpower because in talking aboutthe psychology of willpower it willframe up as to why understanding thisone particular brain Center or Hub ofinputs and outputs from different neuralstructures in the brain and body willindeed allow you to get the most out ofthe tools that have been shown inscientific research to enhance yourlevel of tenacity and willpower in otherwords understanding the psychology oftenacity and willpower while valuable ifit's coupled with an understanding ofthe underlying neural mechanism andnotice I use the singular neuralmechanism not mechanisms for generatingtenacity and willpower will allow you touse and to tailor the specific protocolsfor enhancing tenacity and willpower toyour unique circumstan es so this is yetanother case where certainly lifecircumstances vary from one person tothe next the need for tenacity andwillpower varies tremendously forinstance some people may need moretenacity and willpower in order toengage in certain behaviors others of usmight need more tenacity and willpowerin order to resist certain types ofbehaviors today you will learn about thebrain Center that governs all of thatand then you can frame it within thepsychological understanding of tenacityand willpower so that you can get getthe most out of the protocols that wewill discuss let's start by talkingabout what tenacity and willpowerclearly are and separating tenacity andwillpower from some other psychologicalconstructs that they often get confusedwith because this will be important inunderstanding exactly what we are tryingto build when we say we want to buildtenacity and willpower so tenacity andwillpower can be distinguished fromhabit execution habit execution is whatyou do anytime you wake up in themorning maybe you lie there for a bitmaybe get out of bed immediatelyhopefully you get outside and get somesunlight in your eyes especially oncloudy days go brush your teeth use therestroom engage with others in your homeif you live with others Etc all of thosesorts of behaviors while on some dayscan be a bit more challenging especiallythe get out of bed part maybe you didn'tget a great night's sleep the nightbefore for instance but all of thosesorts of behaviors are behaviors thatyou have the neural circuit to generateand that typically you can generatewithout a lot of willpowerrequired now willpower sometimes alsoreferred to as tenacity grit orpersistence is a distinctly differentphenomenon than habit execution becausewillpower and tenacity require that weintervene in our own default neuralprocesses such as habits or particularpatterns of thinking and essentiallygovern ourselves to do or not do someparticular thing and that processrequires effort it requires energy and Ithink all of us are familiar with thatfeeling of effort or energy that'srequired in order to engage in abehavior that we really don't feel likeengaging in or avoiding a behavior or athought that by default we wouldnaturally just engage in and when I talkabout energy in this context I mainlytalking about neural energy rememberthat neurons nerve cells in your brainand body use chemical and electricalsignaling to communicate with oneanother that's what allows you and allof us to do all the things that we dothink feel move Etcnow of course that chemical andelectrical communication requires fuelsources that indeed come from thingslike glucose ketones the creatinephosphate system multiple fuel systemsfeed the energetics of the brain Butultimately when I talk about energy intoday's discussion I'm talking about theenergy required to engage in or toresist in a particular behavior and thatlevel of energy can be quite Highdepending on how much resistance we arefeeling internally or externally rightsomebody can be telling us you're notgoing to be able to do this you can't doit and you can say no I have a ton ofresolve I have a ton of tenacitywillpower and I'm going to push past allthe barriers that you are setting up forme on the outside often times all toooften I should say we experienceresistance from the inside where we arefeeling like we don't want to dosomething or we really want to dosomething and we are having troubleeither engaging in the thing that wedon't want to do or that we know weshould do but we just don't feel thatlevel of motivation for or we are havinga hard time resisting the thing that'spulling us toward it so in that contextit's important for us not to justdistinguish tenacity and willpower fromhabit execution but also draw out aContinuum with tenacity and willpower attheir most extreme on one end of thatContinuum and apathy and yes depressionon the other end of that Continuum andwe will return to the topic ofdepression a little bit later but I canjust ceue it up right now by saying thatone of the Hallmark features of majordepression is a lack of positiveanticipation about the future that leadsto this is important there's a verbtense here that leads to a much lowertendency to engage in the specific typesof behavior that would allow one toarrive at a particular new different andpositive future so I'm deliberatelyputting apathy and depression next toone another at one end of the Continuumand I'm putting grit persistencetenacity and willpower at the other endof the Continuum and a little bit laterit will be become very clear to you whyI put those particular items on theContinuum as opposed to otherpsychological constructs such asmotivation because it turns out thatmotivation is what allows you to move upand down that Continuum but motivationitself as a verb is distinct from whatwe call tenacity and willpower andmotivation itself is distinct from whatwe call apathy and depression butmotivation is the engine or the motorthe verb that allows you to move up anddown that Continuum and today you willlearn multiple tools that will allow youto move toward the tenacity andwillpower end of that Continuum byengaging a very specific neural circuitbefore we get into the discussion of"

            "text": "neural circuits I'd like to talk aboutthe psychology of willpower and this issomething that really has beenconsidered by psychologist for well overa hundred years William James wroteabout this the ancient Greeks wroteabout this the topic of willpower iscertainly not a new one and yet theformal study of willpower power in thelaboratory context that is bringinghuman subjects into the laboratory andexamining what sorts of conditions allowthem to engage their willpower andtenacity what sorts of conditions reallysap or drain their willpower andtenacity and of course parallelexperiments done in what we callpreclinical models which are animalStudies have revealed to us a lot aboutthe sorts of conditions that allow us togenerate willpower and the sorts ofconditions that drain our willpower nowif we are to throw our arms around thatentire literature there is a big batchof that literature not the whole batchbut there's a big batch of thatliterature that believed and stillbelieves that willpower is a limitedresource much like fuel in the body orfuel in a car now the idea of willpoweras a limited resource is certainly not anew idea but again the formal study ofwillpower and willpower as a limitedresource really dates back a little over20 25 years when Roy bister andcolleagues started to explore the ideathat of course had been kicked aroundfor years that with each additionaldecision that we have to engage acrossthe day and with each additional bout ofwillpower that we have to draw on as aresource that we would drain thisreservoir of willpower that we all havewithin us now bow meister and colleaguesrefer to that process as ego depletionnow when people hear the word ego somepeople think Freud ego super ego id andso forth most people think ego likesomebody having a big personality wherethey think a lot of themselves when BalMeister referred to Ego depletion he wasdefining ego depletion as a concept ofoneself and a concept of outsidechallenges and the degree of effortrequired to bridge one's concept of selfand those challenges and so egodepletion is really a operationalconstruct within the field of psychologyso we don't want to get too distractedby that word ego there's a tendencyanytime people hear ego if they hearnarcissism or if they hear gaslightingto immediately assume that they knowwhat that means when in fact the formaldefinitions of those quite often differfrom the way that they're kicked aroundon social media the internet and even ina lot of popular writing aboutpsychology okay so let's just note thatego depletion is the term that BalMeister used to describe the ability forour willpower to be depleted with eachsuccessive attempt to engage willpowerand by extension our ability toreplenish our degree of willpower if wetake a break from making decisions andengaging our willpower but ego depletionitself isn't the Focus right now theFocus right now is whether or not indeedwillpower is a limited resource andwhether or not with each decision thatwe make and each effort to either engagein an activity that we prefer not to atleast in that moment and with eachattempt to resist a behavior thought Etcthat is pulling on us or that we feelthat we want to engage in by defaulteither you know eating the cookie orthinking the thought or engaging in aparticular type of behavior of any kindand we need to resist that that it isdraining that willpower resource nowbefore I go any further I know that someof you out there are probably aware thatego depletion and the bow Meister theoryof willpower as a limited resource hasbeen very contentious especially inrecent years and so today what I'm goingto do is I'm going to first presentpresent the Bal meister and colleagueswork about willpower as a limitedresource and then I'm going to presentsome of the conflicting evidence thatCarol D my colleague at Stanford schoolof medicine and researchers elsewherehave carried out metaanalyses andentirely new experiments which indeed insome cases contradict the findings ofBal Meister but more often than notcontradict the conclusions that BalMeister Drew about willpower so if weare to understand the psychology ofwillpower and tenacity it's importantthat we understand and the concepts ofego depletion and willpower as a limitedresource even if after hearing all theevidence you decide that willower is nota limited resource and in fact I'm quiteconfident that once you hear about thebow Meister work and then you hear aboutthe work of DW and others which in someways counters the conclusions of bowMeister that you'll have a much firmerand certainly much more completeunderstanding about what tenacity andwillpower are and perhaps and here I'mrevealing my own leanings when havingexamined the totality of the data thattenac and willpower in some cases is alimited resource that can be replenishedby engaging particular processes withinthe body that's right within the bodybut that willpower and tenacity and mostimportantly how to engage tenacity andwillpower especially when you have a lotof challenges in front of you not justone challenge but multiple challengesthat need to be carried out throughoutthe day over weeks over months Etc thattenacity and willpower can be drawn uponrepeatedly without them being depletedif you are clear on your beliefs abouttenacity and willpower so I realizedthat what I just brought up was acontroversy about something that Ihaven't even discussed yet so it mightseem like a bit of a swirl ofinformation for which there's really nocontext but the reason I bring up thecontroversy at this stage of ourconversation is that the moment that thewords ego depletion or willpower is alimited resource falls out of my mouth Ican hear those voices out there sayingwait a second I thought that was alldebunked and I want to make very clearwillpower is a limited resource and egodepletion have not been debunked it'ssimply a controversial area ofpsychological research and moreimportantly for today's discussion wehave to understand the theory ofwillpower as a limited resource if weare to understand the controversy thatis the counterargument of what willpowerreally is that comes from other groupsso I really want to give you both sidesof the story so that when we get to theunderlying neural mechanisms fortenacity and willpower and we get to thetools and protocols for increasing yourlevel of tenacity and willpower and yourflexibility of willpower in differentcontexts that you'll be able to get themost out of those tools and protocolsokay so let's take a look at theevidence that willpower is a limitedresource I think most of us are familiarwith what willpower feels like that iswhat it feels like to be tenacious andagain there are two sides to this cointhere's willpower and tenacity of thesort of trying to engage in a behaviorwhen we really don't want to or when ourimpulse is not to engage in thatbehavior and I say when our impulse isnot to engage in that behavior becauseoften times we want to engage in thebehavior we want to study we want tolearn the instrument we want to performwell we want to exercise we want thebenefits of all those things so it's notthat we don't want the outcomes or therewards of those things and in manycases it's not that we don't enjoy thoseactivities but that for whatever reasonwe are feeling a lack of motivationwe're drifting down that Continuumtoward the more apathetic end of thingshopefully not all the way to deepdepression and apathy but we're driftingthat way or we're not far enough up theContinuum and we're not engaging enoughmotivation to feel like the desire to dosomething either for its own sake or forthe rewards and outcomes of that thingare sufficient to allow us to just dothat thing hence the Nike slogan just doit which is a wonderful slogan exceptthat in the absence of any understandingabout the mechanisms of how we can getourselves to just do somethingoftentimes it falls short and to behonest anytime I hear about peoplesaying well just eliminate the thinkingand just do it that is valuable adviceuntil it doesn't work because when itdoesn't work it simply doesn't work andthen you need to rely on other tools andmechanisms which are the sort that wewill talk about today so while I havegreat respect for the just doit Mantrawhen it doesn't work it doesn't offerany alternative solutions to engagetenacity and willpower and I do not knowanyone on this planet I don't care ifyou're David Goggins or Courtney dwalterthere will be days when telling yourselfjust do this or just don't do that isnot going to be sufficient for you toengage in the behaviors or resist thebehaviors or thoughts that you need toengage in or resist that's just realityand we should ask ourselves why is that"

            "text": "reality and this is a very importantpoint and in fact really illustrates thefirst bucket of tools and protocols forincreasing tenacity and willpower andthese are the tools and protocols that Iwould categorize under the rubric ofmodulators I've talked before on thispodcast about the important distinctionbetween mediators and modulatorsmediators are things eitherpsychological or biological Etc that aredirectly in the mechanisms that generatesome sort of action or emotion thiscould be neurochemicals like dopamine orserotonin and so on modulators arethings that can modulate that is canchange our probability of doingsomething or not doing something butthey do so indirectly and in the contextof tools and protocols to increase ourlevel of tenacity and willpower I wouldbe completely remiss if one of the setsof tools that is the protocols forincreasing the probability that we canaccess high levels of tenacity andwillpower didn't include at least someof these modulators so I'm just going tospend about three minutes on thesemodulators because what we know forcertain is that the regions of the brainthat generate tenacity and again thereis literally a brainhub for generatingwill power and tenacity gets stronginput from the so-called autonomicnervous system the autonomic nervoussystem has two major components they arereferred to as the sympathetic nervoussystem and the parasympathetic nervoussystem keep in mind because when mostpeople hear the word sympathetic theythink sympathy they think emotion it hasnothing to do with that simpa meanstogether and the sympathetic arm of theautonomic nervous system I know that's amouthful is responsible for generatingstates of alertness in our brain andbody everything from Panic to beingalert and calm our tendency to move orour likelihood of moving under pressureit is also responsible for our abilityto resist movement when we need toresist movement and therefore it's anactive process so the sympatheticnervous system is all the things ofaction and when it is involved ingeneratinginaction those are cases where inactionrequires energy okay I want to be veryclear about this the sympathetic nervoussystem isn't just about moving our bodyalthough it has a lot to do with that itis also responsible for our ability toresist movement or thought or emotionwhen we need to do that clamp down onourselves the parasympathetic aspect ofour autonomic nervous system is the onethat sometimes referred to as the restand digest neural circuits and chemicalsand that's true but there's a lot moreto the parasympathetic component of theautonomic nervous system it's alsoresponsible for falling asleep it'sresponsible for us feeling relaxedit is responsible for most of the statesof Mind and Body in which we arequiescent where we don't feel an Impulseto move or when we have a difficult timegetting into action so the sympatheticand the parasympathetic aspect of theautonomic nervous system are always in apush pull with one another think of themmore less on a teeter totter when oneend goes up the other end goes downthey're really in competition with oneanother and it's their balance thatreflects how alert or how sleepy wehappen to be now the reason I'm givingyou this rather geeky nerd nomenclaturefilled discussion about the autonomicnervous system in the context ofwillpower is that regardless of whetheror not you believe willpower is alimited or an unlimited resource we knowone thing for sure and that's thatwillpower and tenacity ride on ourcurrent autonomic function we cantranslate that to Everyday Language bysaying that when we we are well restedfor instance when we've been gettinggreat sleep of sufficient duration theprevious night and the night before thatour level of tenacity and willpower toengage in things that we would notordinarily engage in by default and ourability to resist behaviors and thoughtpatterns that would otherwise be ourdefault behaviors and thought patternsis much higher conversely when we arenot getting enough quality sleep on aregular basis our ability to call ontenacity and willpower is diminished nowthat series of statements I just made isclearly going to be a duh for mostpeople but it is very important tounderstand that when we are sleepdeprived when we are in physical painwhen we are in emotional pain and orwhen we aredistracted when we are thinking aboutsomething else aside from what we aretrying to engage tenacity and willpowerin order to do or not do tenacity andwillpower will be diminished now all ofthose things together are just a biggerduh we all know this if you got asplinter in your foot it's really hardto think about not thinking aboutsomething else if you are extremelyhungry or if you had an argument withsomebody that you really care about andthey said something that wasparticularly vexing to you and it'slooping around in your head it's goingto be very hard to engage in somethingelse that you need to do because you'regoing to be distracted likewise ifyou're sleep deprived likewise if youare a bit sick or run down or if you'rein any kind of physical or emotionalpain your ability to draw on tenacityand willpower will be diminished so it'san absolute truth that your ability togenerate tenacity and willpower rides ona reservoir of autonomic function andtoday we don't really have a way ofquantifying the level of autonomicfunction or dysfunction in a very simpleway it's not like resting heart ratealthough resting heart rate is involvedfor instance if you haven't slept wellfor a few nights or if you'reparticularly stressed overtrained youwake up in the morning with asignificantly elevated heartrate however there is no simple metriclike heart rate or blood pressure oreven cortisol level that can tell youwhether or not your autonomic functionis imbalance that is the sympathetic andparasympathetic systems of yourautonomic nervous system are in the bestpossible balance to generate tenacityand willpower we don't yet have such ametric although there are companies thatare starting to develop devices thathopefully will give us indices ofautonomic function or dysfunction but itis important that we acknowledge that ifyou're not taking care of thefoundational modulators of tenacity andwillpower none of the subsequent toolsand protocols that we will discuss aregoing to help you that much over timeyou might get tenacity and willpower toengage one day when you're very sleepdeprived but it's going to be verydifficult to consistently engagetenacity and willpower for that reasonif you have any struggles with sleepthat is getting enough quality sleep ona regular basis please see the zero costtoolkit for sleep that we've put athubman lab.com please also see theperfecty Sleep Mastery sleep episodesalso at huberman lab.com and please alsosee the episode with expert guest DrMatthew Walker professor of sleepneuroscience and psychology atUniversity of California Berkeley wejust revamped the huberman lab websiteso if you go to hubman lab.com and youput something like sleep into the searchfunction it will take you not just tothe toolkit for sleep but to the exacttime stamps that will queue upparticular topics and protocols aroundsleep so if you were to put sleep andlight it would take you to thoseparticular protocols if you were to putsleep and magnesium 3 and8 it would takeyou to those particular protocols and soon and so forth okay I don't want to gettoo far off topic here during today'sdiscussion but if you're not sleepingwell and if you're not managing yourstress levels well it's going to be muchharder for you to engage tenacity andwillpower regardless of the tools youhappen to use and those tools could beeverything from behavioral tools tosupplements to prescription drugs youneed to get those foundational mod atorsin check and there are a lot of zeroccost ways to do that that are allspelled out very clearly at theresources I just described likewise forstress if you're experiencing challengeswith stress both short-term medium-termor long-term stress if you think youhave elevated cortisol levels which bythe way may not be the case there are alot of tools for modulating stress inreal time increasing your stressthreshold Etc simply go to the hubonlab.com website and put in stressthreshold tools or stress realtime toolsand you'll get a bunch of zero costtools will allow you to do that it'salso worth mentioning that when we getto our discussion about the Neuroscienceof tenacity and willpower that you willunderstand why autonomic health andautonomic function is so important forour ability to engage tenacity andwillpower I'll just tell you right nowit's because the neural circuits of theautonomic nervous system provide directand robust input to this Hub in thebrain this brain location that governsour ability to allocate our mind andbody toward particular activities or toresist particular activities as many

studies like it andthey all generally follow the samecontour and that General Contour is asfollows bow meister and colleagues andnow many other Laboratories have doneexperiments where they bring humansubjects into the laboratory and thosehuman subjects have to do something thatrequires mental effort or energy AKAwillpower the classic example of this isyou bring people into the laboratorysome of them might actually be dietingor fasted although not always and thereare two platters set out for them oneplatter contains radishes just plainradishes by the way I hate radishesunless they're pickled radishes I don'tknow why that is so these experimentspicked my least favorite vegetable Ilove many other vegetablesI disdain theradish that was just a personaleditorial in any case the radishes areset out and next to them are freshlybaked cookies and in the room is thewafting Aromas of freshly baked cookiesso I think it's fair to say that mostpeople because of a hardwired tendencyto like sugar and fat especially whenthey are combined would prefer to eatthe cookies versus the radishes I knowthat there are some mutant out therethey're saying I like radishes more thancookies but look most people likecookies more than radishes the subjectsin these studies are divided into twogroups one group is told you have toresist eating the radishes the othergroup is told you have to resist eatingthe cookies and then the subjects areobserved during this time typically butthis is really not what the experimentis about per se this stage of theexperiment is really designed to getpeople to resist a certain kind ofbehavior and the assump assion againthis is an assumption because there's nobrain recordings here no one's in an MRImachine looking at what brain areas areactivated or not activated there's nocortisol being measured at least not inthese earlyexperiments these people are eitherresisting something that's pretty easyto resist radishes or they are beingasked to resist something that for mostpeople is going to be harder to resistthan resisting radishes which isresisting freshly baked cookies and thatchallenge has been made even moreDifficult by the wafting Aromas offreshly baked cookies in the room and insome cases has been made even moredifficult because these people aredieting and keep in mind that when youcalorie restrict or when you putyourself on a diet of any kind there isa wellestablished mechanism in the brainby which the neurons that engage hungerespecially hunger for fat and sugar andthat respond to things like Aromas andtaste are heightened that is theiractivity levels are heightened whichmeans that things that smell really goodsmell really really good when you'rehungry things that ordinarily wouldtaste really good taste really reallyreally good when you finally eat them sothe key component of this stage of theexperiment is to engage people'swillpower the second part of theexperiment has all of the subjectsseparately engage in another challengingtask and the challenging task that theyare asked to engage in is to solve aparticular puzzle and again differentexperiments used different puzzlesdifferent experiments use differentcontexts but the original experimentsthat b meister and colleagues did hadpeople try and solve a puzzle that couldnot be solved so it's very verydifficult in fact it's impossible butthe subjects weren't aware of that andthen what was measured was how longsubjects persisted in trying to solvethis impossible to solve puzzledepending on whether or not previouslythey had to resist the radishes which ispretty easy to resist or resist thecookies which is at least harder toresist and for some people would be veryvery hard to resist now you can probablyalready guess what the outcome of thisand similar studies was because itbirthed this entire belief Camp withinthe field of psychology that willpoweris a limited resource the outcome wasthat if people had to resist the cookieswhich is harder to do than resisting theradishes that they would persist forless timewhen they had to try and solve a puzzlethat unbeknownst to them could not besolved conversely if people had toresist something that was pretty easy toresist such as resisting eating radishessomething that for me would be very veryeasy to resist well when they weresubsequently faced with trying to solvea very difficult indeed impossible tosolve puzzle they persisted much longerokay so put very simply the studyconcluded that if you have to resist onething and it's a hard thing to resistwell then you have less air quotes hereresistance in you willpower to engage inanother difficult task subsequentlywhereas if you had an easy challengejust prior or no challenge just prior tobeing faced with a challenge such as avery difficult puzzle well then you hadmore resource more willpower to apply tothe solving of that puzzle so theconclusion that b meister and colleaguesDrew from those results was thatwillpower is a limited resource but itdidn't specify nor did they specifyexactly what that limited resource isand this was quite an attractive Theorybecause it jived well with most people'sperception of what willpower andtenacity was for them this idea that yesthere are things that challenge us bothto do and to resist but that we can dothat but when we are asked to do thatagain and again and again while we maybuild up some capacity to engage ourwillpower and tenacity it and of coursethere are those rare individuals thatwe've heard about and some of us knowthat seem to have just a kind ofbottomless reservoir of willpower andtenacity most of us have an intuitiveunderstanding of how hard it is toconstantly be in friction with life toconstantly have to push ourselves to dothings and to resist things and thatwhile that capacity can expand and growand we can get better at it that theredoes seem to be something here justsubjectively speaking there does seem

oneof the most metabolically active organsin our entire body if not the mostmetabolically active organ in our entirebody requires a lot of fuel it requiresa lot of glucose now of course the brainmainly runs on GL glucose but if you'refollowing a ketogenic diet your brainwill mainly run on ketones but for mostpeople who are omnivores or eatingcarbohydrates glucose is the main andpreferred fuel source for neurons fornerve cells in your brain and body forthat matter Bal moister and colleaguesraised the hypothesis that perhapsglucose availability itself is theresource that's limiting willpower andin a whole set of experiments theyreally showed that if people are askedto do a difficult task to engage theirwillpower and this could be done byresisting a particular Behavior or byengaging in a particular Behavior I'lljust give you an example of engaging ina particular behavior that requireswillpower or at least focus and mentalenergy to contrast it with the resistingradishes versus resisting cookiesexample that I gave earlier one commonpractice within experiments like this isto give people a very long passage ofwords so it's a story and then to givethem some sort of rule about how to editthat passage maybe they have to crossout every third e or the E that arrivein the middle of sentences next toconsonants but not other vowels you knowstuff that takes a lot of energy sothese are DOs as opposed to resistingbehaviors like we were talking aboutearlier resisting the radish resistingthe cookies although in many of theseexperiments there's a command to dosomething you know cross out certainletter E in this passage but also toresist the reflex to cross out otherease and of course all this is is undertime pressure and often times it's beingrewarded or scored this is the way thatpsychology researchers get people toengage in particular uh experiments andbehaviors and resist certain things inthe context of a laboratory environmentwhen those things frankly are kind ofboring and meaningless they'll pay youmore if you do well at the task umthey'll give you money and then subtractthe money that you're going to get atthe end of the experiment if you makeerrors and things like that and they'lldo it under time constraint as Imentioned earlier so there were lots ofdifferent conditions were again here airquotes draining people's willpower andtenacity and certainly draining theirmental attention and then they wouldhave them do another subsequent task soin many ways this just mirrors the firstcookie radish experiment done by Balmeister and colleagues but there was animportant intervention put between thefirst and the second hard task and thatintervention was to give one group aglucose beverage of about 150 caloriesor so so they would drink a glucosebeverage to increase levels of bloodglucose the preferred fuel source forthe brain versus giving them anartificially flavored drink or justwater or something that was of coursematched for flavor but that did notcontain any glucose or calories now thisis a clever experimental design if youthink about it because at least at afirst glance the only thing that reallyseems to be different is theavailability of glucose for the brainand you can probably guess what theoutcome of these studies was the outcomeof these studies was that when subjectsare given glucose in between a firsthard task that required willpower and asecond hard task that required willpowerand in some experiments a third hardtask that required willpower that theirlevels of willpower were maintainedconsistently from one task to the nextand in some cases increased from onetask to the next if they had moreglucose available because they drankthis glucose drink so what's reallyinteresting and frankly really niceabout these studies is that they attemptempted to bridge a psychologicalconstruct like tenacity and willpowerand to test the argument that willpoweris an Expendable resource and yet it'san Expendable resource that isreplenishable by linking that to aphysiological variable and thephysiological variable they linked it towas glucose availability in the brainnow this set the field of psychology andin fact the field of pop psychology thatis the discussion about formal findingsin the field of formal psychologicalresearch Ablaze people were so excitedabout this I mean this set of findingsreally pointed to the argument that ifyou could just keep levels of brainglucose elevated across your day or atleast stable across the day that youwould have more willpower and tenacitythis thing that humans have been seekingmore of since the beginning of time nowall of that seemed fine and good and infact a lot of products and courses wereborn out of that literature people werearguing that you should sip on glucosedrink while doing any kind of hard taskthat you should sip on glucose drinksbetween tasks that you should bethinking about literally fuel that youingest into your body as fuel forpsychological processes within yourbrain that would allow you to performbetter in work in school in athleticsand relationships and all of the domainsof life but of course anytime there is aprominence or a real excitement about aparticular finding in any field ofscience but in particular in Psychologywhere it feels so applicableas did the Bal Meister results you aregoing to get other groups that are goingto try and replicate those findings andthat are going to dig into the findingsthemselves and look at the statisticslook at how well or poorly powered thosestudies were we don't want to get into afull discussion about powering studiesright now but powering studies has a lotto do with addressing the question ofwhether or not there were enoughsubjects in the study to really draw theconclusion that one Drew or whether ornot the statistics fell out out as yesthere was a significant effect ofglucose ingestion on Willpower andtenacity but if there weren't enoughsubjects well then there are othervariables that could potentially explainthose results so there were a lot ofmetaanalyses and other studies trying toreplicate the work of Bal meister andthat's where things got controversialnow we can take a step back from all ofthat controversy after all we don't wantto spend too much time on thecontroversy itself rather we want toknow what the counter interpretation ofthe bow Meister results was and I wantto be very clear there was no realdispute as to whether or not bow Meistergot the results that he and hiscolleagues claimed to have obtained theydid get those results the questionreally was about the interpretation iswillpower a limited resource and if itis is the physiological resource itselfglucose availability to the brain so in2013 a colleague of mine at Stanford

            "text": "Carol D and our department of psychologydid a study in which she examined thisidea that willpower is a limitedresource and the idea that the resourcethat's limited is glucose availabilityfor the brain so D and colleagues did anexperiment that in many ways mirroredthe overall organization of theexperiments done by Bow meister andcolleagues there was a difficult tasksome cases the difficult task was thatCrossing out of particular ease within apassage task followed by anotherdifficult task and the difficult taskthat came second was the Stroop taskthis is a task I've talked about beforeon this podcast although some episodesago so those of you that are notfamiliar with the STP task the STP taskis where subjects are presented withwords in different colors and they areinstructed to either read the word so topay attention to the content of the wordor to the color in which the font of theword is written this might seem prettyeasy to most of you right if I put up acard that says apple on it and apple iswritten in green you probably wouldn'thave a hard time if you had beeninstructed to tell me what color is theword written in for you to say greenokay but if I I were to hold up a cardthat said red but the font is actuallyin the color green it's a little bitharder and if I were to then do that fora 100 cards or 300 cards and put youunder time pressure where you're losingmoney that you're sure to get if youmake mistakes or you will earn money atthe end of the experiment if you getanswers correctly well then you startmaking more mistakes that's just the waythese experiments work so they did avariation on the strep task that isn'texactly the way I just described it andthe stoop task by the way is one that'sused to probe prefrontal cortex functionthis area of our brain right behind ourforeheads that is responsible for manythings but in part is responsible forcontext and strategy setting given aparticular set of rules so if you getonto the bus or get onto the subwayversus walk into a black tie dinner thecontext and rules are very verydifferent as to what you would say ornot say how you would behave how youwould dress your prefrontal cortex islargely although Al though not entirelyis largely responsible for a lot of thecontext setting and Rule setting fromone situation to the next and if youthink about the stre task it's reallyjust a context dependent strategy taskyou either have to pay attention to themeaning of the words or the colors inwhich those words are written and thenumber of mistakes that you'll makedepends on how much time pressure you'reunder what sorts of neurologic orpsychiatric challenges you might befacing or not facing so on and so forthbut it's a very robust task that'sexisted in the scientific literature fora long period of time so the Dexperiment and by the way there wereactually three experiments in this paperI won't go through all of them in detailfor sake of time but I will provide alink to the paper in the show notecaptions but the major focus of thestudy was to have people engage in onehard task and then in another hard taskboth of which draw on Willpower testingthe idea that willpower is a limitedresource and then providing some ofthose subjects with a glucose-rich drinkor other subjects with a drink that wasartificially sweetened so it had noglucose no calor calories but tasted yesthey match them for taste I know some ofyou don't like artificial sweeteners aresaying those don't taste exactly likereal sugar but they managed to matchthese drinks for Taste but in one casethe drink would clearly increase bloodglucose in the other case the drinkwould not raise blood glucose so theresults of this study are reallyspectacular in my mind because what thisstudy found was that yes indeedingesting glucose can improveperformance on these multiplechallenging willpower requiring taskshowever the degree to which the glucosecontaining drink could improveperformance depended on whether or notyou believed that willpower was alimited resource and whether or not youbelieved that resource was glucose inother words if you hear and believe thatwillpower is a limited resource wellthen indeed with each subsequent taskthat you engage in or life event of anykind that you engage in that requireswillpower and tenacity you will haveless willpower and tenacity to draw onwhereas if you believe that willpowerand tenacity are unlimited and in factare divorced from blood glucose as thephysiological source of willpower andtenacity well then you can engage in onechallenging task and another challengingtask and another challenging taskwithout any diminishment in performancenow that of course leaves us all in avery tough position because how are weto decide what to believe if we knowthat willpower can be a limited resourceor willpower cannot be a limitedresource ah well the results of thedirect study and by the way I shouldshare with you the title of the studythe title of the study not surprisinglyis beliefs about willpower determine theimpact of glucose on self-control andthis was a study published in theproceedings of the National Academy ofSciences again I'll provide a link tothis study in the show note captionsthere are three major experiments inthis study as I mentioned before I justgave you the major conclusion of all ofthem sort of woven together and if itwasn't clear already the majorconclusions are that yes ingestingglucose can improve your ability toengage tenacity and willpower AKAself-control from one task to the nextprovided that you believe that glucoseis the limiting resource for engagingtenacity and willpower if you don'tbelieve that well then you can engagetenacity and willpower without ingestingglucose and that's where theartificially flavored drink comes inI'll leave it to you to kind of unpackwhat that means experimentally but it'sa very clever experimental design thatDW and colleagues came up with becauseit argues that yes indeed it's hard todo a challenging thing right afteranother challenging thing but there's noreason to think that you can't do bothof those things while engaging theutmost tenacity and willpower if youbelieve that tenacity and willpowerexist within you as a single mechanismthat can be harnessed and that it's nota single mechanism that has a reservoirthat runs down as you engage in one hardthing thing to the next now this is veryimportant because we are about totransition into our discussion of thephysiological that is the neuralunderpinnings of tenacity and willpowerwhich as it turns out is one major setof brain circuits now there could beothers that are yet to be discovered butwe know that there is one major set ofbrain circuits in particular one brainarea believe it or not that an entirecollection of more than two dozenstudies really points to as the seat theor of what we call tenacity andwillpower but before we transition tothat and the tools and protocols thatthat physiological neural understandingset forth for us to all use and applyI'd be remiss if I didn't mention thatbow Meister wasn't about to hear theseresults from dwen colleagues and justsay Okay willpower is not a limitedresource it's not blood glucose it's allwhat you believe about willpower it'sall what you believe about bloodglucose rather BME himself went back tothe lab and did subsequent experimentsthat in some ways not all counter the dresults so I'm not trying to confuseanybody but I wouldn't be doing my jobif I didn't give you both sides of thestory now the good news is that thetools and protocols that we are going toarrive at work regardless of whichpsychological Camp you happen to be inthe bow Meister camp or the D camp now Idon't want to give the impression thatthese are Waring camps and I also don'twant to give the impression that theseare the only two camps of thought andexperimentation within the field oftenacity and willpower there are manygroups working on these subjects indeedthere have been metaanalyses that haveconfirmed the major theories of Balmeister and there are metaanalyses thathave refuted the major findings of BalMeister I will provide links in the shownote captions to a couple examples ofeach so that you have those to peruse ifyou like but let's discuss for a momentwhat B Meister found when they went backand re- researched I think that's a wordre researched the idea that willpower isa limited resource and that glucose isthe that limitingresource balme and colleagues looked atthe D data and said okay fine the datalooked great except for the fact that inreal life and in many previousexperiments that they and others haddone it wasn't just two hard challengesback toback but often two or three orfour and what Bal meister and othersfound was that when subjects arepresented not with just two challengesback to back but three or morechallenges so back to back to back toback challenge is that have to engage alot of neural energy a lot of willpowertenacity resistance to do certain thingsand effort to engage in certain kinds ofbehaviors and cognitive processes thatwhen subjects had glucose available tothem in the brain by way of ingestingthese glucose drinks sipping those inbetween the tasks sometimes even duringthe tasks that their performance that istheir willpower and tenacity to engagein challenges was maintained acrossthose multiple challengesand they conceded that one's beliefabout willpower could indeed dictatewhether or not willpower was or was nota limited resource and whether glucosewould or would not enhance one's abilityto engage willpower but they argued thatif one confronts multiple challengingcircumstances as is very naturalistic aswe say it's very typical of everydayreal life then the availability ofglucose during and between tasks theability for the brain to engage in itsexternal environment and take reads ofits internal environment how we feelinside relative to what's expected of uswas very valuable in allowing people toengage this thing that psychologicallywe describe as tenacity and willpowerI'd like to just take a brief break and"

            "text": "you that the conversation we are aboutto have is not going to be just a bunchof nomenclature and mechanisticunderstanding of the origins of tenacityand willpower rather it argues thattenacity and willpower have a unifiedsource that is a specific set of brainareas that when active engage thatfeeling of tenacity and willpowerregardless of what we are confrontedwith regardless of whether or not we aretrying to engage in something thatreflexively we wouldn't otherwise wantto engage in and regardless of whetheror not we are confronted with somethingthat we have to resist and to me that'sextremely reassuring because whether ornot you believe that blood glucose isthe limiting resource for willpowerwhether or not you believe that yourbeliefs about willpower and bloodglucose impact your level of willpowerwhat we know for sure is that there's asingle set of brain circuits indeedthere's a single brain area that seemsto be able to largely if not entirelyexplain this phenomenon that we calltenacity and willpower and that shouldbe reassuring because what it means isthat tenacity and willpower is thereflection of a neural circuit functionthat is a skill it's an expression ofsomething that we all have within us weall have this particular brain area andquite excitingly this is the third pointthis brain area is highly subject toplasticity there are specific thingsthat we can do and there are specificmindsets that we can adopt that allow usto increase the activity of thisparticular brain area indeed to increasethe size of this particular brain areaso that we can call on tenacity andwillpower not just in one circumstancelike school or musical learning orathletic Endeavors or relationshipEndeavors but rather that we can call onthis brain area in the context of anyand all circumstan ances where willpowerand tenacity are required now we talkabout Neuroscience a lot on this podcastbut it's not often that I point to aparticular brain area and canconfidently say this particular brainarea has an absolutely integral role insomething as kind of highlevelpsychological as tenacity and willpowerbut today we can do that and that'sbecause there's a collection of morethan two dozen studies that point to oneparticular brain area and of course itsconnections with other brain areasbecause no single brain area operates inisolation every brain area is operatingin the context of neural circuits otherbrain areas that it receives inputs fromand gives inputs to and so on but thisone particular brain area really doesseem to underly what we call tenacityand willpower and we know that throughseveral lines of evidence first of allI'll tell you the name of the brain areaalthough the name itself isn't going totell you much unless you're aneuroscientist or anatomist so I'll givea little bit of background about it thename of the brain area is the anteriormid singulate cortex the anterior midsingulate cortex is part of a largerbrain area called the singulate cortexand in humans versus animals it goes byslightly different names unfortunatelyit's just one of the consequences ofdifferent researchers and different Labscalling the same thing different thingsit could be really frustrating but we'llmake it very simple because today wewere referred to this area as theanterior mid singulate cortex which is asub div vision of a larger brain areasimply called the singulate cortex theanterior mid singulate cortex resides inthe frontal loes so it's behind yourforehead although that doesn't tell youanything because all of your brain isbehind your forehead if you think aboutit and it's about a third of the wayback toward the back of your head andyou actually have two of thesestructures two anterior mid singulatecortices one on each side of the brainand they receive a lot of inputs from alot of different areas and we'll talkabout what those areas are because thisis extremely important when thinkingabout the different psychological andphysiological resources that you candraw upon to engage tenacity andwillpower but for the time being let mejust go through the evidence in kind oflist format of why we feel so confidentthat the anterior mid singulate cortexis such a vital hub for engagingtenacity andwillpower for each of these points thatI'm about to make there is indeed atleast one if not several qualityreviewed studies in humans so there's alot of data from animals both rodentsand primate models Etc that we're nottalking about today but I should mentionall of which supports the human data andvice versa the data I'm going todescribe now come from humans and from avariety of different types of studies sothere are a lot of different ways thatone can consider if a brain area isimplicated in a given psychological orphysiological phenomenon like motivationor sadness or visual perceptionand those include for instance if abrain area is active during a givenphenomenon so one way to explore this isto put literally wire electrodes downbelow the skull record the electricactivity of neurons and assess whetheror not the electrical activity of thoseneurons changes when a person is sayviewing faces or feeling a particularway like feeling tenacious or feelingbored or feeling aggressive and so onanother way of assessing a particularbrain area's role in a givenphysiological or psychologicalphenomenon is in individuals where thatparticular brain area is injured youmight expect that a particularphenomenon like willpower like theability to perceive faces is present orabsent whether not it's exacerbated orwhether or not it's diminished otherways of assessing whether or not a givenbrain area is involved in a givenphenomenon is whether or not that brainarea literally changes size whether ornot changes in volume over the course ofsome sort of training so for instance ifsomebody is not able to play a musicalinstrument such as myself and then I ora subject in one of these experimentslearns a musical instrument and thevolume the size of the particular brainarea is assessed across the learning orsimply before and after that musicallearning and it grows or perhaps even ifit shrinks or changes shape one mightdetermine that it is somehow somehowinvolved in the process of learning amusical instrument you couldn'tunequivocally conclude that but alongwith other types of evidence one couldperhaps conclude that so that's just apartial list of ways to assess brainarea function other ways includeassessing what other areas a given brainarea gets input from so for instance inthe case of the anterior mid singulatecortex we will soon discuss the factthat it gets robust input from theautonomic nervous system which youalready learned about it gets robustinput from reward systems of the brainsuch as the dopamine and serotonin basedreward systems of the brain and it getsrobust input from the context andstrategy setting areas of the brain aswell and many other different brainareas so there's a structural logic asto why the anterior mid singulate cortexwould be involved in tenacity andwillpower but no single anatomical orphysiological or lesion-based finding isas compelling as when we consider all ofthe results about the anterior midsingulate cortex together and side byside so forinstance recordings by neural Imaging ofthe anterior mid singul cortex in anunbiased way meaning people are put intoa brain scanner and brain activity isexamined and mass all of the brain areasare looked at and people are presentedwith either a hard task or an easy taskrevealed that the anterior mid singulatecortex shows elevated levels of activityin the hard versus the easy task andagain I want to point out that theresearchers were not looking for thatresult they simply observed that resultin addition if people who exhibit highlevels of academic performanceacross many different subjects are putinto a brain scanner that evaluatesso-called resting state connectivity sono task but simply levels of activity indifferent brain areas that occurspontaneously so they're just sitting inthe scanner looking at a blank screenthe resting or spontaneous levels ofactivity in the anterior mid singulatecortex of high achieving individuals ishigher relative to those of lowerachieving individuals in addition peoplethat have lesions or disruptions ofanterior mid singulate cortical functionshow increased apathy and depression andreduced levels of tenacity andmotivation across the board regardlessof what domain of life one is askingabout whether or not it's athletic oracademic Etc indeed successful dietersshow elevated spontaneous and what'scalled evoked levels of activity in theanterior mid singulate cortex sospontaneous again just at rest they havehigher levels of activity in theanterior mid singulate cortexand for those that are presented withfood and they have to resist that foodand they have to resist the smell ofthat food and the potential taste ofthat food the activity of the anteriormid singulate cortex goes up evenfurther especially in those individualswho can resist that is who can engagewillpower to not eat the delicious fooditem conversely individuals that havefailed to exert sufficient willpower tolose their desired weight and this wasfor medical reasons related to trying toachieve MedicalHealth as well as people who are obeseseem to have diminished levels ofactivity in the anterior mid singulatecortex in addition people who aredepressed who Express a lot of apathyand here we're talking about clinicallydiagnosed major depression show reducedlevels of activity in the anterior midsingulate cortex humans that Express alot of what's called learnedhelplessness that is they've adopted thebelief and the actions associated withthe belief that no matter what they dothe outcomes are not going to be whatthey desire Express lower levels ofneural activity in the anterior midsingulate cortex so you can see thislist goes on and on but it in fact getseven more interesting remember earlier Imentioned that successful dieters haveelevated levels of neural activity inthe anterior mid singulate cortex nowthat might seem like a good thing andindeed it can be a good thing butthere's a pathologic conditionassociated with dieting and one'sability to engage willpower and resistfood and that's in the case of eatingdisord such as anorexia nervosa now I'vedone a hubman Lab podcast solo episodeabout anorexia nervosa and on thatpodcast I made the point that I'll makeagain now which is that anorexia nervosais the most deadly of all thepsychiatric conditions leading to deathin a very large percentage of peoplethat have it now fortunately there aretreatments and more emerging all thetime but it's a very seriouspsychological and physiologicalcondition that is extremely deadlyindividuals with anorexia nervosaexhibit heightened levels of activity intheir anterior mid singulate cortex bothat rest and when presented with food andI don't want to go on a full tangentabout anorexia because we coveredanorexia on the previous podcast episodeabout anorexia which by the way you canfind at hubman lab.com simply searchanorexia or eating disorders within thesearch function but one of the clearsymptoms of anorexia nervosa is that thereward Pathways of the brain which weknow feed into that is directconnections to the anterior midsingulate cortex seem to be activatedunder conditions in which people withanorexia avoid food as opposed to eatfood and then there's a very interestingand positive literature about so-calledsuper aers so what we know for sure isthat as people age in particular betweenthe ages of 60 and 90 there's areduction in the size of many brainareas but the anterior mid singulatecortex in particular unless certainthings are done to offset that we aregoing to talk about what thoseparticular things are in just a fewminutes but there's a particularcategory of humans that's alive now andthat live a very long time these are thepeople that stand the greatest chance ofbecoming centenarians and many of themare centenarians so-called superagersbut also within the category ofsuperagers are people who are 60 yearsold or more because not all of them havereached 80 90 yet and have the cognitionof 40 olds 30y olds and often even ofpeople in their mid 20s now there are alot of things that are different aboutthese super agers super aers in thesense that they are maintaining veryyouthful levels of cognition but one ofthe things that's become very apparentfrom the neuroimaging data is that superagers maintain a volume a size of theanterior mid singulate cortex that issignificantly greater than their ag-matched cohorts so the exciting thing isthat there are many many lines ofevidence pointing to the fact that theanterior mid singulate cortex at leasthas something to do with our ability togenerate tenacity and willpower and thatit when active moves us up thatContinuum away from apathy anddepression toward states of being ableto engage in or resist particular typesof behaviors so what I just described asa bunch of neuroimaging structural"

whenwe're talking about tenacity andwillpower we're really talking about oneof two things we are either talkingabout that sense within us that has ussaying I will no matter what you tell meno matter what you put in front of me nomatter what is rolled my way I willblank now the other expression oftenacity and willpoweris that within us within you within mewhen tenacity and willpower are activewe have that sense within us thatfeeling in our body and that thoughtpattern AKA feeling in our brain that nomatter what you say no matter what youdo no matter what you put in front of meI won't so really willpower is either anexpression of I will or I absolutelywill is perhaps a better way to State itor I absolutely won't now that mightseem like just a simple subjectivereordering of a bunch of physiologicaldata and psychology studies but it's notit's actually far more important for usto understand this I absolutely will andI absolutelywon't aspect of willpower because ifindeed there is a single brain area thatcan govern willpower and willpower isnot one but is at least two things thesense of I absolutely will no matterwhat you say do Etc or I absolutelywon't no matter what you say do Etc wellthen this brain area can't be a simpleswitch it can't be willpower on Willowoff willpower on Willow off it can't beabsolute as we say it must be graded itmust have levels so it's more like aslider on a light switch than an onversus off light switch in addition tothat if there is truly one brain areathat plays a critical role in generatingtenacity andwillpower and tenacity and willpower issomething that it's required from us ina lot of different contexts where wehave to say I absolutely will yes this Iabsolutely won't know that I absolutelywill also yes this etc etc right becauselife is complex even just the simplething of say dieting or trying to get aparticular degree or trying to navigateeven a simple illness like I'm going toget through this weak despite feelinglousy I'm going to take good care ofmyself you know all of these things insome sense require tenacity andwillpower and the behaviors we need toengage in and avoid engaging in is veryDynamic depending not just on who we areand what we're trying to do or not dobut also where we are that day thatmoment well that means that the anteriormid singulate cortex also needs accessto information about context it needs tounderstand what's rewarding ornon-rewarding in the cont of what we'retrying to accomplish not just what feelsgood in themoment now fortunately there have been anumber of studies exploring not just theactivity levels of the anterior midsingulate cortex or the size of theanterior mid singulate cortex in thevarious conditions we talked aboutbefore depression obesity successfuldieters successful students successfulathletes Etc but a lot of anatomicaltracing studies both from fixed that isfrom Dead brain tissue so postmortembrain tissue in humans but also nowadaysthey're certain types of neuroimagingparticular something called diffusiontensor Imaging that allows one toexamine the flow of information in andout of different brain areas throughso-called white matter tracks tracksmeaning TR r a CTS track so these arethe wires that connect neurons arecalledaxons and those axons are in sheathedwith a fatty substance called myelin andthat enement with milin allows them totransmit information very quickly you'llsee where I'm going with all this injust a momentand what we know is that the anteriormid singulate cortex again of which youhave one on each side of the brain abouta third of the way back from yourforehead to the back of your brainapproximately right above the so-callCorpus colossum this very robustcollection of white matter tracks thatconnects the two sides of the brain wellit gets input and sends input to anumber of different brain areasincluding but not limited to thefollowing autonomic centers that controlfor instance cardiovascular f functionincreases or decreases in heart raterespiration how fast and how deeply youbreathe or how shallowly and slowly youbreathe immune system inputs and outputswith thespleen not directly but through a coupleof different stations with the veryorgans in your body that can release Bcells and t- cells and immune moleculesthat can combat bacterial viral andfungal infections and that can repairphysical wounds and it communicates withthe endocrine system with the systems ofthe brain and body that release forinstance estrogen and testosterone whichby the way are present in both males andfemales and on a previous episode of Thehubman Lab podcast with Robert spolskias my guest we talked about for instancethe role of testosterone and many peoplethink oh testosterone is all aboutaggression testosterone is all aboutattack testosterone is all about matingthat is completely false while it can beinvolved in those differentprocesses what Dr spolski and Idiscussed is that one of the majorfunctions of testosterone in the brainis to make effort feel good and you cansee and we'll talk a little bit moreabout how that links up very directlywith this concept of tenacity andwillpower so the first point is that theanterior mid singulate cortex is indirect communication with all of theareas of the brain and through a coupleof other stations the body that modulateour sense of tenacity and willpowerwhich we talked about earlier the needfor Sleep the need for pain pain or lackof pain or emotional Comfort ordiscomfort to modulate our level oftenacity and willpower the interior midsingulate cortex is also directly linkedup with premotor centers these are thecenters of the brain that organizeparticular patterns of behavior andindeed that can suppress particularpatterns of behavior as I tell you thatyou're probably filling in the blanksthis is engaging in a behavior orresisting a behavior the interior midsingulate cortex is also directly wiredin with the reward Pathways of the brainit can trigger the release of dopamineit can also respond to the release ofdopamine and that dopamine release couldbe generated behaviorally it could begenerated through some sort of foodreward it could be pharmacologic thereare a number of different ways that thedopamine system can communicate with theanterior mid singulate cortex the pointhere is that it is in directcommunication with the anterior midsingulate cortex and the anterior midsingulate cortex is in directcommunication with the dopamine systemand what I just gave you was franklyjust a partial list of the differentareas of the brain that arecommunicating robustly with the anteriormid singulate cortex it gets informationabout interoception our readout of howwe feel in our body it also has robustinputs and outputs with the areas of thebrain that are associated withexteroception our perception of what isout around us so all of that provides alogical basis for the neuroimaging datathe lesion data the volumetric data thatwe talked about a few minutes ago in thecontext of depression anxiety highperformance anorexia and so onbut one of the most important arguments"

            "text": "that's ever been made in favor of theanterior mid singulate cortex being amajor seat for tenacity and willpowercomes from Dr Lisa Feldman Barrett whois soon to be a guest on the hubman Labpodcast we've actually recorded thatepisode already and it should be outvery soon Lisa's laboratory is wellknown for pioneering research on emotionand affect I strongly encourage you tolisten to that episode once it comes outand it was actually Lisa herself thatcued me to the importance of theanterior mid singulate cortex and Lisaand colleagues have written severalspectacular reviews about the anteriormid singulate cortex and its role intenacity and motivation I will providelinks to a few of those in the show notecaptions the one that I'm particularlyexcited about the one that I've spentnow an immense amount of time with isentitled The tenacious brain how theenter mid singulate cortex contributesto achieving goals so if you have abackground in biology even if you don'tI think you'll find that review view tobe very interesting and it furthersubstantiates a lot of the points that Imade a few moments ago about thedifferent scenarios and types ofindividuals that seem to be able toengage their anterior mid singulatecortex under different conditions and toa greater or lesser extent than othersso hats off to Lisa for queuing me tothis incredibly interesting brainstructure I had known that it existedafter all I teach neur Anatomy tomedical students at Stanford and Itaught neuron Anatomy for many manyyears but I don't think enough peopleand indeed very few professionalneuroscientists could tell you what theanterior mid singulate cortex does butit has this apparently incrediblefunction in generating tenacity andmotivation along those lines one of themost incredible and important studiesabout the anterior mid singulate cortexand its capacity to generate feelings oftenacity and willpower comes from one ofmy colleagues at Stanford Joeparvy who essentially went into humanbeings who needed brain surgery forother reasons and stimulated particularbrain areas with a very high degree ofprecision the title of the paper thatI'm referring to was published in 2013in the journal neuron cell Press Journalexcellent journal and it's entitled thewill to persevere induced by electricalstimulation of the human singulate gyrusnow you'll notice the title said humansingulate gyrus not anterior midsingulate gyrus but because they hadelectrodes and a stimulation techniquethat would allow them to stimulate invery small regions extending as littleas 5 mm but no more away from thestimulation site they were able to marchtheir stimulation around different subregions of the singulate gyus of humanswhile those people were awake and thenasked those people how do you feel whatare you experiencing In This Moment Inaddition to that they were recordingvarious autonomic parameters from thosepeople so heart rate breathing inaddition to brain wave activity so whatthe subjects report when their anteriormid singulate cortex was stimulated isthat in their wordssomething was about to happen they feltas if there was some sort of pressureupon them from the outside not physicalpressure but that something was about tohappen in fact one of the subjectsdescribed the sensation as it's as ifthere's a storm off in the distance butI know I need to go into the storm and Iknow I can make it through the stormokay another subject described theexperience of having their anterior midsingulate cortex stimulated as okaysomething not necessarily good as goingto happen but I know that I need toMarshall resources and resist and I'mconfident that I can push through nowbecause Parisian colleagues areexcellent scientists they of course didcontrol experiments where they wouldtell the person okay we're stimulatingthat same brain area that a moment agoyou told me created this feeling of somepressure upon you that you have toresist some sense of fight or urgency topush back but in reality During certaincontrol conditions they were notstimulating those brain areas and thesub objects then reported I don't feellike anything's about to happen yeah Idon't feel anything at all in otherwords it was the stimulation of theanterior mid singulate cortex and onlythe anterior mid singulate cortex thatcreated the sensation within people thatthere was something to resist that therewas something putting pressure on themagain not physical pressure butpsychological pressure and that theywere going to have to Marshall resourcesin order to push back upon in fact theyreported feeling as if their body wasgetting ready to do something onesubject said something along the linesof yeah I feel like I'm about to dosomething I'm about to go someplace ordo something to resist this foreoingsense that's now coming over me so thisis very interesting and of course is inline with all of the data that wediscussed before about neural activitypatterns both spontaneous and evokedabout brain volume changes in theanterior mid singulate cortex so on andso forth and it really points to theidea that the anterior mid singulatecortex is a hub a hub Hub that receivesinformation from A diversity of brainareas that we talked about a few minutesago and that generates a particularsense within us that we are going to beforward Center of mass that we are goingto resist something and that perhaps weare going to move or act in someparticular way or as we've beendiscussing all along resist action insome particular way but that it requiresthat we Marshall resources which takesus back of course to the studies of bowmeister and indeed of dck where theyexplored willpower as a limited resourceperhaps glucose perhaps as that limitedresource beliefs about willpower andglucose probably with a high degree ofcertainty are going to be involved theretoo but regardless of that controversyit's clear that there's an energyrequired there's an activation state ofEngagement orresistance to a particular Behavior orthought pattern that we all associatewith this phenomenon of tenacity andwillpower and in a kind of miraculousway you know as a neuroscientist we'regenerally taught nowadays thatindividual brain areas don't reallytrigger individual functions andperceptions of the brain there are a fewexceptions to that you know you have afusiform face area that really does seemto be involved in the perception offaces and when lesion you can'trecognize faces but outside of just afew limited contexts it's very rare thatone comes across a literature thatacross all of the studies involvedpoint to a single brain structure andits networks as giving rise to somethingas complex and flexible as tenacity andwillpower but in the case of theanterior mid singulate cortex it reallydoes seem to meet those criteria as thebrain Hub responsible for tenasity andwillpower now a key idea that Dr FeldmanBarrett has contributed to studies ofthe an mid singulate cortex as astructure that helps us generate what wecall tenacity and willpower to help usachieve different types of goalsis this idea ofallostasis most of you have perhapsheard of homeostasis which is the ideathat all of our cells all of our organsindeed our entire body and psychologyare always seeking homeostasis theperfect balance of sleep and activity offood and burning fuels of oxygen andcarbon dioxide and so on and so forthand while homeostasis certainly existsand is a valid phenomenon there's also aconcept that we hear far less about butthat is equally important which is theconcept of allostasis allostasis is theidea that much of what our brain andbody need to do but especially our brainis to allocate right allostasis toallocate resources to particularfunctions depending on our motivationalgoals and the challenges upon us and inevery way what we understand about thestructure and function of the anteriormid singulate cortex is that it is doingjust that it is deciding how muchglucose should a given brain areaconsume perhaps a brain area that'sinvolved in visual perception becauseyou're involved in a motivational taskwhere in order to succeed you need topay careful visual attention toparticular things or you're involved ina task where you have to listen toparticular things or perhaps you areinvolved in a physical foot race whereyou don't want to allocate a lot ofenergy towards thinking about yourstride or your step unless that'snecessary and you actually want to shutdown your brain activity as much aspossible except for the brain areas thatare required to get you to continue runin that sense the interior mid singulatecortex as a sort of a dial on how muchfuel is consumed not by the brain andbody as a whole but by individual brainand body parts meets all the criteria ofwhat you would want for a brain areathat controls things like tenacity andwillpower because even for thoseindividuals who seem to just have anendless supply of tenacity and willpowerthey too have to go into habitualBehavior they can't simply lean intoevery aspect of life with the kind ofresistance from outside and theresistance against those outside forcesor even resistance to internal forcesvoices in their head Etc on a constantbasis they still need to sleep theystill need to be functional in thatexpression of tenacity and willpowerthey need to be able to strategy switchand they need to be able to come off thegas as we say not because tenacity andwillpower are necessarily a limitedresource but because for so many aspectsof Life engaging tenacity and willpoweris not advantageous hence the example Igave earlier about eating disorderswhere an apparently hardwired functionof our brain to be able to generate somesort of reward for resisting a givenBehavior goes too far and then canactually threaten one's own health oreven life so the concept of allostaticload allostatic balance and alisticfunction is something that we get intoin a fair amount of detail in thediscussion with Dr Feldman Barrett inthat episode which is coming out soonbut in the meantime if you are to thinkabout the anterior mid singulate cortexas having a single function the functionthat Dr Feldman Barrett has ascribed toit as controlling how much energydifferent brain and body areas shouldget in a given context well that makes alot of sense to me and I think it's theone that best describes all of thefunctional data indeed includes or jibeswith all the anatomical data about theanterior mid singulate cortex as wellone of the really important twists in"

            "text": "because frankly the data are veryconvincing that the anterior midsingulate cortex is a vital Hub withinyour brain for allocating energy andresources to generating tenacity andwillpower and perhaps it's taking you alot of tenacity and willpower to getthis far through the episode waitingwith baited breath presumably to tolearn how exactly you can improve thefunctioning of your anterior midsingulate cortex now fortunately thereare published peer- rreview data thatexplain how to do that in fact there's astudy that was published in 2006 bycolum and colleagues entitled aerobicexercise training increases brain volumein aging humans and before you go runoffliterally and engage in cardiovascularexercise I'm just going to describe toyou the Contour of this study and whatspecifically was done so that you canbest implement the best protocols foryour particularcircumstances this was a studyexploring why and how certain brainareas and brain volume generallydecreases as we age it's well known as Imentioned earlier that individuals agedreally 50 and older and maybe even asearly as 30 and older experience adecrease in brain volume with particularbrain areas shrinking faster than othersbut of course there are other peoplethat include include the superagers thatwe talked about earlier and many manyother people who are not superagers whodon't experience the same decrease inbrain volume so why is it that theymaintain the same brain size that theydid when they were younger or undergoless decrease in brain size that's whatthe researchers for this study wereinitially interested in understandingand they did come to some reallyinteresting conclusions about that butthey also came to some interestingconclusions that relate to today'sdiscussion on tenacity andwillpower this study involved havingindivid ual who were 60 to 79 years olddivided into one of two groups one groupdid cardiovascular exercise the othergroup did more calisthenics SLstretching type exercise both groups didone hour of exercise three times perweek the group that did cardiovasculartraining initially started off by doingand by the way they just simply calledit aerobic training but this could berowing on the rower this could berunning this could be cycling I thinkfor sake of understanding application oftools and protocols you would want topick any kind of activity that you coulddo consistently without injuringyourself that's what's really importantand that gets your heart rate elevatedthey started off theseindividuals with relatively lowintensity cardiovascular exercise forthat hour getting their heart rate up toabout 50% of their maximum heart ratebut very quickly had those individualsincrease the intensity of thosecardiovascular training sessions so theywere doing again three 1 hour sessionsper week getting their heart rate up toabout75% of their maximum heart ratesometimes a little less 60% sometimes alittle bit more but in that Generalrange so for those of you that thinkabout different zones of cardio this isprobably in the area of zone three notquite Zone 2 cardio maybe zone threecardio so where one can not carry out aconversation very easily but where oneis not completely gasping for air as onewould if they went to their maximumheart rate or near maximum heart rateokay so three 1hour episodes ofcardiovascular training per week at amoderately high intensity the othergroup simply doing calisthenics andstretching for the equivalent amount oftime and they had another group withinthe study that were much younger thatdid similar activities or no activitysimply as a control for the brainImaging data now I'm summarizing thestudy with a fairly broad brush both forsake of time and of course I'll providea link to the study in the show notecaption so you can access it and impresin more detail if you like but Iwouldn't be talking about this study ifit were simply a study aboutcardiovascular training and brain volumeI'm talking about this study because thespecific brain areas that maintained orin some cases increased in volume as aconsequence of doing these three hoursper week of moderate intensitycardiovascular training included ofcourse the anterior mid singulate cortexthat was actually the primary locationin which the maintenance of brain brainvolume was observed and in some casesincreases in brain volume were observedright this is a group of people whonormally would belosing volume size of their anterior midsingulate cortex but for which 3 hours aweek of moderate intensitycardiovascular training maintained thevolume the size of that anterior midsingulate cortex and in some casesincreased the volume the size ofanterior mid singulate cortex and theyalso observed a maintenance or increasein the size of the anterior white mmatter tracks remember t r a c TS Ididn't spell that out before just tospell it out for fun although that isthe sort of thing that I would probablydo those white matter tracks are thecommunication routes by which differentbrain areas communicate and thisanterior white matter tract thatmaintained size in the people that didcardiovascular training as compared tothose that simply did the calisthenicstraining and stretching is the verywhite matter tracks that connects thetwo sides of the brain the frontal lthat allows the anterior mid singulatecortex on one side of the brain and theanterior mid singulate cortex on theother side of the brain as well as otherbrain structures to communicate with oneanother so this is really spectacular Imean the authors of the study didn'tembark on the study to find or even lookfor increases or maintenance in thevolume of the anterior mid singulatecortex and the communication routes inand out of the anterior M singulatecortex it just so happened thatcardiovascular training done three timesper week for an hour at a time at modernintensity increased the size of theanterior mid singulate cortex and as Imentioned the white matter tracks whichallow information to go in and out ofthe an mid singulate cortex now weshould all be asking ourselves why wouldthat be the case I mean somebody gets ona stationary bike and pedals or goes outon a road bike or runs is theresomething inherent to running or cyclingor rowing or swimming or an aerobicsclass dancing Etc that gets the heartrate up that directly feeds into the ENTmid singulate cortex after all is theanter mid singul cortex responsible forgenerating the activity of running orcycling or swimming no rather theinterpretation is that in order toengage in this one hour three times perweek set of sessions of cardiovasculartraining they had to allocate resourcesthey had to get up out of a chair theyhad to get off the couch they had to sayno to other potential obligations socialengagements meals Etc and get to theseexercise classes or sessions that theydid with others or alone now aninteresting and in fact important aspectof the study is that the compliance withthis three hours per week ofcardiovascular training was very high85% of individuals engaged in thesesessions across the six-month period ofthe study I should have mentioned thatearlier the study was carried out overthe course of six months they did nothave the opportunity to do neuroimagingafter say a week or two weeks so theyimage these people's brains before andthey image these people's brains afterthis six-month period it's anybody'sguess as to whether or not they wouldhave observed the same or maybe evengreater increases at the one monthinterval Etc we simply don't knowthere's a great cost both energetic andfinancial to doing these kinds ofstudies so they looked at a six-monthperiod but setting all of that asidethis is a very important study in thecontext of today's discussion becausewhat it means is that if we acknowledgethat the anterior mid singulate cortexand the volume of an mid singulatecortex is related to one's ability togenerate tenacity and will power for anynumber of differentEndeavors well then having access to atool or a protocol that can increase thesize of one's anterior mid singulatecortex is going to be extremely valuableso what's the takeaway from this studythe takeaway from the study is notnecessarily that you should be doingthree one-hour bouts of cardiovasculartraining per week for six months tomaintain or increase the size of youranterior mid singulate cortex I do thinkthat's the case if you're not alreadydoing sufficient amounts ofcardiovascular training and whatconstitutes sufficient amounts well Ithink there's General agreement now bothbetween the material that I've coveredin our foundational Fitness protocol andin the series on exercise physiologywith Dr Andy Galpin and in variousdiscussions with Dr Peter AA the generalagreement is that everyone should begetting somewhere between 150 to 200minutes of so-called Zone 2 lowintensity cardiovascular exercise perweek but the results of this studyreally point to the idea that we shouldall be doing perhaps hours but certainlywe should all be doing some form ofphysical exercise but for any of us thatare interested in increasing tenacityand willpower across domains both forcognitive and physical Endeavorsemotional Endeavors too for that matterthat we should be engaging in someexercise and again we're going to talkabout cognitive exercise in a moment butthat we should be engaging in someexercise that we are not already doingnow that of course will lead many peopleto think wait I'm already doing two 100minutes per week of Zone 2 cardio howcan I add 3 hours more of cardio that'snot what I'm saying what's important tounderstand about this whole discussionabout tenacity and willpower is that theability to engage the anterior midsingulate cortex and to build up itsvolume literally and increase itsactivity relies on one critical featurewhich is that you have to be in somedegree of resistance some lack of Desireor I should say lack of reflexive desireor ability to engage in that behaviorokay this is super important if you'rethinking about tools and protocols toincrease your level of tenacity andwillpower if for instance you love coldshowers and Ice baths well then it'svery unlikely that taking cold showersor getting into an ice bath is going toincrease your level of tenacity andwillpower further it might reinforce thetenacity and willpower that you'vealready built but it's not going toincrease it further you need to addsomething or subtract something thatmakes it harder not easier to engage inor resist a behavior okay I want to bereally clear about this in the studythat I just described from col andcolleagues they took individuals thatwere not exercising prior to the studyand those people had to thereforegenerate significant amounts ofmotivation in order to regularly engagein these three one hour per weekepisodes of cardiovascular training okaynow the fact that there was nocomparable increase in the volume of theanterior mid singulate cortex oranterior white matter tracks in thegroup that did the calisthenics andstretching is also important because itimplies that activities that are easierto carry out that don't get the heartrate elevated as much are not going tocreate changes in this brain structurethat is associated with tenacity andwillpower and there's a niceconfirmation of that in the study infact because they observed as one wouldexpect a significant increase in V2 Maxin the individuals that were assigned tothe group that did cardiovasculartraining but they did not observe asignificant increase in V2 Max in theindividuals that did three 1 hour perweek sessions of calisthetics andstretching across the six-month periodokay so the important Point here is ifyou're already doing let's say an hour aweek of moderate to high-intensitycardiovascular training or resistancetraining for that matter you're going toneed to add something in order to getfurther activation of this brain hub fortenacity and willpower and of course theidea here or else we wouldn't be talkingabout it is that that activation andthat increase in volume in the an midsingulate cortex would then beapplicable to other endeavors forinstance academics or some aspect ofyour professional life or relationshiplife that you can build up tenacity andwillpower as a capacity within you or weshould say within your anterior midsingulate cortices but that the route toactivating and increasing the robustnessof your anterior mid singulate cortexrequires that you engage in somethingthat you don't really want to do andcertainly not something that you'reregularly engaging in already rememberway back at the beginning of today'sepisode we compared willpower andtenacity to Habit execution right wellthis is a simple case where if you'realready doing something simplycontinuing to do it might maintain whatyou've already got but it's not going tofurther build up your tenacity andwillpower so along those lines I don'twant you to Simply take the three 1hourcardiovascular sessions per weekprotocol that they use within the studyand expect it to increase your levels oftenacity and willpower unless of courseyour Curr only doing 1 hour ofcardiovascular training at moderate tohigh intensity per week in which caseincreasing to two hours may very wellincrease your interior mid singletcortex and overall level of tenacity andwillpower and certainly doing threehours per week would be expected to doit even further and I should mentionthat we can extrapolate from this studyin a meaningful way I think in agrounded way that's related to mechanismand say well if you for instance like mecan't play a musical instrument or arenot bilingual in language that taking onthe challenge if indeed it's a challengeand for me it would be a challengeperhaps for you as well to learn aninstrument as an adult or to learn asecond or maybe a third language ifthat's challenging and in fact that'ssomething that you're resisting doingwell then great it's going to provide aneven greater opportunity to engage theactivity of the anterior mid singulatecortex remember that study that showedthat hard tasks hard challenges are whatactivate the entor mid singulate cortexeasy challenges don't okay habits thatare reflexive simply do not so you haveto pick something hard you have to picksomething that's either physically andor psychologically hard and of course wewant to highlight the fact that younever want to engage in anythingphysical or cognitive emotional orotherwise that is psychologically orphysically damaging to you right becausethis is something that you're going towant to maintain or carry out for someperiod of time now alone those lines wecould imagine a huge number of different"

            "text": "protocols that one could engage in but Ithink there are a couple of key thingsthat extend across all of thoseopportunities first of all it's clearnow based on our understanding of theanatomical inputs to the anterior midsingulate cortex that while exercise isgreat and certainly movement of the bodywhen we don't want to move our body AKArunning AKA weightlifting AKA learning anew skill like dancing or gymnastics orsomething of that sort is going toengage this hub for tenacity andwillpower the an mid singulate cortexbut there are a number of otheropportunities to do that and we canthink of those in a kind of playfulcontext but one that is both playful andhighly functional and applicable so forinstance if you already resistance trainand you're doing what we now generallyagree as a field is the minimum of sixhard working sets per muscle group perweek in order to maintain or buildmuscle size and strength some of youdon't want to build muscle size buteveryone should be trying to maintainmuscle strength there's a very highcorrelation we now know between musclestrength and cognitive functionespecially as one gets past 40 years ofage but even younger so maintainingneuromuscular function and strength isvery very important even if you don'twant to increased muscle size you canlearn how to do that by the way we havezeroc cost protocols they're all listedout by going to hubin lab.com check outthe series I did with Dr Andy Galpincheck out the key toolkit takeaways fromthat series also available at hubnlab.com just put exercprotocols into the search function butlet's say you're already resistancetraining you're already doingcardiovascular training what can you doto build up your tenacity and willpowerfor application in not just thatendeavor but other endeavors well picksomething that you don't want to dothese are what I call in a verynon-scientific way micro sucks thesethings suck but they suck a little bitand they're safe right you have to pickthings that are safe for you but theysuck enough that they require someeffort they require getting over somefriction engaging in something that youdon't reflexively want to do so forinstance that might be one extra set atthe end of a round of three to five setsof a givenexercise or it could be for instance 100jumping jacks at the end of what youconsider a hard run it could be forinstance finishing out that languagelesson and then deciding to do fiveminutes of sitting still thinking aboutthe material that you learned when youso desperately want to just jump on yourphone right pick circumstances where thedegree of resistance is very high wherethe degree of impulse to do somethingelse than the thing that you know youneed to do is very high and then startapplying those on a regular basis itcould be after every workout it could bein the middle of the workout forinstance some people have a really hardtime not looking at their phone during aworkout I like to listen to podcasts ormusic during a workout but I really tryand resist text messaging and readingemail and things of that sort whileworking out so the harder that becomesthe more I think about it and the more Iresist it the more presumably activationof the anid singulate cortex I'm gettingand that you would get as well so theselittle micro sucks like ah it sucks notto look at the phone right now it sucksto do 100 jumping jacks at the end of arun of course if you're excited to tothe 100 jumping jacks at the end of TheRun that's not going to be a good Avenueinto activating and increasing thevolume of your anterior mid singulatecortex everything we've talked about upuntil now supports the statement I justmade easy tasks desirable tasks don't doit it's the thing you don't want to doso imparting these little micro suckscan be very useful you'll have to thinkabout what particular micro sucks youincorporate into your exercise routinesyour cognitive routines and your dailyroutines and how often I don't think youneed to go completely berserk on thisdoing them all day long but keep in mindthat these are the sorts of behaviorsand resistance of behaviors becauseagain certain micro sucks might be youknow if you're somebody who practicesintermittent fasting you know we don'twant to send you into the realm ofeating disorder but you know maybe youreally do wait an extra 15 minutesbefore your usual first meal time whichfor me would really suck that might evenmove from micro suck into macro suckbecause I like to eat when I'm hungrybut waiting a few extra minutes for noother reason than allowing oneself toactivate that anterior mid singulatecortexcircuitry would be one way to try andbuild up one's tenacity and willpower soat some level they should all seempretty logical it actually doesn't evenrequire a firm understanding of the LNeuroscience for it to of make senseright you want to do something youresist doing it that's building uptenacity and willpower you don't reallywant to do something you do it that'sbuilding up tenacity and willpower wellI do believe in fact there a lot of datato support the fact that ourunderstanding of the mechanismsunderneath things like tenacity andwillpower can be very advantageous whentrying to carry out these differenttypes of behaviors to increase tenacityand willpower why well today we learnedthat that there's a huge variety ofcontexts in which one can activate theENT mid singulate cortex which meansthat it's not cardiovascular exerciseper se it's not resisting the cookie perse right it's not waiting 15 moreminutes to eat or making sure that yousit still and don't look at your phoneat the end of a learning bout and reallythink about what you learned a littlebit more even though it really reallysucks to do that it's really hard itcreates a lot of agitation it's notabout any one of those protocols if youwill per se rather it's about deliberateengagement in the behaviors that weleast want to do in a given moment or ifyou're trying to build up willpower andtenacity to not engage in certain typesof behaviors it's about our ability tosuppress behavioral action now I do wantto highlight the potential hazards ofthis type of approach to building uptenacity and willpower and indeed tolife and we can call on the earlierexample of Eating Disorders as a verysafe alient one right there is a way inwhich all of this can run a muck and wecan get so heavily into stoicism we canget so heavily into the idea of buildingup tenacity and willpower that it takesus into Realms that are unhealthy for uspsychologically emotionally Andorphysically and that's certainly not thegoal here and I certainly don't want tomotivate that type of behavior orresistance of behavior we should all beseeking a relationship with life andwith goals Etc that involves yes Ibelieve some degree of activatingtenacity and willpower really findingthat fight within us that Parisiancolleagues found when they stimulatedthe anterior mid singulate cortex ofpeople right all of a sudden they'relike yep I'm driving into a storm orthere's something about to happen andI'm going to have to resist I'm eithergoing to have to do something or resistdoing something but there's somethingactivated inside of me I think it's veryimportant that we are all able to Garnerthose resources and to activate thoseStates within us voluntarily but I alsoknow from experience and from observingothers and indeed from the literature onthe anterior mid singulate cortex as itrelates to eating disorders and otheraspects of neurologic and psychiatricchallenges is that we also need to learnhow to turn that off with that said thelittle micro sucks that we discussed you"

plunge when youabsolutely don't want to do it wellprovided you can do it safely that'sgoing to be the best time to do it ifyour goal is to build up tenacity andwillpower to say nothing else of theknown benefits of things like deliberatecold exposure and exercise like jumpingjacks Etc there are also entireLandscapes of life and academics andsport that afford US the opportunity tobuild up tenacity and willpower I forinstance can recall taking my so-calledqualifying exams in graduate schoolwhere they ask you questions until yousay I don't know until you don't knowthe answer it's just like that puzzle inthe bow Meister study they're taking youto the point where you basically can'twin and that turns out to be a veryimportant lesson that extends beyond theinformation that they're asking youabout and of course every student at theend of their qualifying exam runs offand figures out the answer to thequestion that they couldn't get theright answer to sometimes there is aright answer sometimes they not if thecommittee is pretty diabolical they'llgive you an impossible to answerquestion because there's no answer butthe point being that whether or not it'sin martial arts whether or not it's insports whether or not it's in musicwhether or not it's in academics whetheror not it's in relating to others thereis some value to getting to that pointwhere you can't solve the puzzle and Ithink that's an important message for usto understand and maybe to incorporateinto our tools and protocols that thereare some Endeavors that have no endpoint right there's no winning there'sno Finish Line and those type ofEndeavors are extremely importantextremely important for continuallybuilding up our tenacity and willpowerso much so that we can even take asomewhat 3,000 mile view from the topdown onto everything we've talked abouttoday and think about thosesuperagers those superagers that somehoware able to maintain the cognitivefunction of a much younger person and ifyou look at the Daton super agers andpeople similar to them you'll find arealways engaged in some activity that'shard for them they're always trying tolearn something and they have a sort ofplayfulness about it but they seek outthose friction points both resistance ofcertain behaviors right trying to not docertain things but perhaps more oftendoing certain things learning learning anew skill learning Pottery learningmusic placing themselves into novelenvironments that are a littleuncomfortable or a lot uncomfortableprovided that it's safe so from thatstandpoint one could even entertain theidea that because these people areliving much longer than everybody elsein addition to maintaining the cognitivefunction of much younger individualsthat perhaps the inter mid singulatecortex in its ability to allocateresources to different parts of ourbrain and body to meet C certainmotivational goals is actuallyassociated with this thing that we callthe will to live now the concept of thewill to live is certainly getting alittle bit squishy for scientists likeme who yes I'm happy to entertaindiscussions that relate to psychologicalconstructs such as tenacity andwillpower but as you've probably noticedI'm very comfortable with and veryexcited about the idea that okay maybeit's relate somehow to brain energeticsand glucose maybe not certainly I'm onboard the idea that belief impact ourphysiology and Physiology impacts ourbeliefs I'll Dr Ali Crum who was a gueston this podcast previously talked aboutbelief and mindset effects which arevery powerful they change our physiologyliterally and the D data that we talkedabout today but of course also thatthere are brain areas and circuits thatunderly these things that we calltenacity and willpower so when we getinto a discussion about tenacity andwillpower and then find ourselves as weare now talking about the will to live Idon't think it's going too far to saythat when one looks looks at the data onlongevity both physical andpsychological longevity it's very clearthat there are underlying physiologicalexplanations not the least of which islikely to be the maintenance if notgrowth over the lifespan of thisanterior mid singulate cortex but alsothat the people that are achieving thatare continually forging in theirenvironment they're continually lookingfor new environments they're continuallyexploring they are not becomingcomplacent they are not becomingsedentary they not existing down at thatend of the Continuum that we call apathyand depression but that they're notexisting down there and they areexisting up toward the end of theContinuum that we call tenacity andwillpower and engaging motivation to getthere okay motivation again as a verbbut in doing that that they'rereinforcing the very circuits that giverise to tenacity and willpower this iswhat in engineering terms is referred toas a closed loop it's like you do awhich leads to B which leads to C whichfeeds back onto a and makes a that muchmore likely to occur it's like turningthe little a into a capital A and thenturning into a bold face Capitalunderline a you know the buildup ofneural circuits so while today wefocused a lot on an individual brainarea anterior mid singulate cortex andin many ways I presented it as if it'sthe Beall end all of tenacity andwillpower it is not the Beall end all oftenacity and willpower it's our abilityto engage the anterior mid singulatecortex that allows us to expresstenacity and willpower but in thisclosed loop fashion it's our ability toexpress tenacity and willpower that thenfeeds back onto that circuit and makesit more robust and more likely to beaccessible in the future when weencounter something that we don't wantto do or that we have to resist verystrongly in order to not engage in somesort of behavior or thought pattern sothe big takeaway is that if you want toincrease your tenacity and willpower youabsolutely can you can do that bytriggering activation of this incredinedible Hub within the brain theanterior mid singulate cortex for whichthere is now a very large amount ofevidence is at least Central to thewhole process of generating tenacity andwillpower the I absolutely will do thatand the no I absolutely won't do thatit's the resistance Hub it's the thingthat's allocating resources to do thething that we don't want to do or thatsomeone's trying to prevent us fromdoing it's also the brain area that'sallowing us to resist doing the thingthat we want to do or that someone elsewants to do when we decide that's notgood for us we can really be certain"

            "text": "about tenacity and willpower we talkedabout the idea gleaned from research inthe field of psychology that tenacityand willpower are limited resources andthat perhaps again perhaps they relateto this concept of ego depletion thatrelates to this idea that what isdepleted or what's limited in ourability to engage tenacity and willpowersomehow relates to brain energetics andfuel consumption namely glucose I alsotalked about the conflicting data thatargues that if we believe tenacity andwillp power are limited and that glucoseis the thing that limits them well thenthat's exactly what happens so I talkedabout that controversy and some of thedata that actually reconcile a bit ofthe differences there so in the absenceof new data you'll have to decide foryourself what you believe about tenacityand willpower however it's veryimportant to acknowledge the universaltruth which is that our tenacity andwillpower rides on the tide of autonomicfunction that is when we are sleepdeprived when we are in pain when we arein emotional pain or when we aredistracted our tenacity and willpower isdiminished whichcalls upon all of us to make sure thatwe're taking care of our autonomicfunctions through viewing morningsunlight getting sufficient sleepadequate nutrition social connectionsthings that I've covered extensively onprevious episodes then we talked aboutthe neural underpinnings of tenacity andwillpower and this absolutely incrediblebrain structure that we'll call a hubbecause it's not operating in isolationbut rather it's getting inputs from lotsof different brain areas related toreward executive function autonomicfunction motor planning goal seeking Etcthat we call the anterior mid singularcortex this phenomenally interestingbrain area that seems to be able togenerate this thing that we calltenacity and willpower and that when weengage or Express tenacity and willpowerby doing the thing that we least want todo by not doing the thing that we mostwant to do in a given moment that weactually can build up our anterior midsingulate cortex and thereby build upour future capacity to engage the entermid singulate cortex when we need tocall on tenacity and will power and thenwe talked about some of the peer- reviewdata that shows how that actually can bedone where these individuals who werenot previously exercising did achallenging three 1hour sessions perweek of cardiovascular training andindeed their anterior mid singulatecortex and the connections two and awayfrom it increased in a way that set themapart from their age related cohortsthat is their brains stayed youngermaybe even got younger whereas thosethat did not do the hard thing rightthat didn't engage tenacity andwillpower did not experience the sameeffect and then we talked about howthose data could be extended into anumber of different Realms such ascognitive learning learning languageslearning math learning art learning anynumber of different things or in thePhysical Realm engaging in certain typesof exercise that one is not alreadyengaging in adding in a little bit ofadditional exercise specifically at atime in which you least want to do thator extending your fasting period ifthat's something that you're doing andthat you can dohealthfully simply because it allows youto exercise your anterior mid singulatecortex AKA tenacity and willpower and ofcourse we highlighted that all of thatneeds to be done in the context ofpsychological and physical safety wedon't want anyone to do things that aregoing to be physically damaging tothemselves but if one simply takes thestance of okay what's something that Ican do in a moment that will allow me tobuild up tenacity and willpower wellit's going to be the thing that I leastwant to do in that moment or the thingthat I least want to resist doing inthat moment to periodically add in thoselittle what I referred to as microssucks a very um non-scientific franklynon- psychological term but I think weall understand what it means littlethings that we don't want to do but thatif we do them you can be sure that youare activating the interent midsingulate cortex and thereby increasingthe probability the likelihood that youcan access tenacity and willpower morereadily in the future so what I've donetoday is explain the scientific studiesin the realm of Psychology andNeuroscience that explain what tenacityand willpower are and what allows us tobuild up our tenacity and willpower overtime and then it's really up to all ofus to you and to me and everybody elseto figure out in which particulardomains and with which frequency we'regoing to decide to build up our tenacityand willpower so it's clear thattenacity and willpower are not justresources that we need to call upon fromtime to time in order to overcome thingsbut then indeed calling on our abilityand building up our ability for tenacityand willpower can allow us much richerenjoyment of life and perhaps can evenextend our life by engaging the will tolive thank you for joining me fortoday's discussion about the science of"

    "episode_summary": "In this episode, I discuss neuroscience and psychology studies that address the basis of willpower and tenacity, how they differ from motivation and how we can all increase our levels of willpower and tenacity. I discuss whether willpower is a limited resource, the controversial \u201cego depletion\u201d theory of willpower and the role that beliefs play in determining our tenacity and willpower. Then, I discuss the neural basis of willpower in the brain and body and how tenacity and willpower relate to sleep, stress, focus, and possibly lifespan. Then, I provide a series of science-supported tools and protocols to increase your level of tenacity and willpower.\nFor show notes, including referenced articles and additional resources, please visit hubermanlab.com.\nThank you to our sponsors\nAG1: https://drinkag1.com/huberman\nMaui Nui Venison: https://mauinuivenison.com/huberman\u00a0\nHelix Sleep: https://helixsleep.com/huberman\u00a0\nLMNT: https://drinklmnt.com/huberman\u00a0\nMomentous: https://livemomentous.com/huberman"
