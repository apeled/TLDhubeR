Betterhelp offers professionaltherapy with a licensed\ntherapist carried out online.I personally have been doing weekly\ntherapy for more than 30 years,and while that weekly therapy was\ninitiated not by my own request,it was in fact a requirement\nfor me to remain in high school.Over time, I really came to\nappreciate just how valuabledoing quality therapy is.In fact, I look at doing quality\ntherapy much in the same way thatI look at going to the gym or doing\ncardiovascular training such as running,as ways to enhance my physical health.I see therapy as a vital way\nto enhance one's mental health.The beauty of Betterhelp is\nthat they make it very easy tofind an excellent therapist.An excellent therapist can be defined\nas somebody who is going to be verysupportive of you in an objective way,\nwith whom you have excellent rapportwith, and who can help you arrive\nat key insights that you wouldn'thave otherwise been able to find.And because Betterhelp therapy is\nconducted entirely online, it'sextremely convenient and easy to\nincorporate into the rest of your life.So if you're interested in Betterhelp,\ngo to betterhelp.com/hubermanto get 10% off your first month.That's Betterhelp, spelled\nhe help.com/huberman.Today's episode is also\nbrought to us by Waking up.Waking up is a meditation app that\noffers dozens of guided meditationsessions, mindfulness trainings,\nYoga Nidra sessions and more.By now, there's an abundance of data\nshowing that even short daily meditationscan greatly improve our mood, reduce\nanxiety, improve our ability tofocus, and can improve our memory.And while there are many different\nforms of meditation, most peoplefind it difficult to find and stick\nto a meditation practice in a waythat is most beneficial for them.The Waking up app makes it extremely\neasy to learn how to meditate andto carry out your daily meditation\npractice in a way that's going to bemost effective and efficient for you.It includes a variety of different types\nof meditations of different duration,as well as things like Yoga Nidra, which\nplace the brain and body into a sort ofpseudosleep that allows you to emerge\nfeeling incredibly mentally refreshed.In fact, the science around Yoga Nidra is\nreally impressive, showing that after aYoga Nidra session, levels of dopamine in\ncertain areas of the brain are enhancedby up to 60%, which places the brain and\nbody into a state of enhanced readinessfor mental work and for physical work.Another thing I really like about\nthe Waking up app is that it providesa 30 day introduction course.So for those of you that have not\nmeditated before or getting back to ameditation practice, that's fantastic.Or if you're somebody who's already a\nskilled and regular meditator, wakingup has more advanced meditations and\nYoga Nidra sessions for you as well.If you'd like to try the Waking up app,\nyou can go to wakingup.com/hubermanand access a free 30 day trial.Again, that's wakingup.com/huberman.And now for my discussion\nabout mental health with Dr.Paul Conti.Dr."

            "text": "Conti, welcome back.Paul Conti: Thank you.Andrew Huberman: In the first episode\nof this series, you laid out for usin a very structured way what true\nmental health looks like, essentiallywhat we should all be aspiring to.And you touched on these themes of\nagency and gratitude as verb states,really, ways of being in the world\nthat allow everybody to have some senseof well being, to have some sense of\nthemselves in a way that is kind tothemselves and to others, and really\nto feel good and do good in their life.Without question, this is\nwhat people want, right?You also spelled out for us these two\npillars, the structure of self andthe function of self, that consist\nof a number of different things thatfrom which geyser up or kind of give\nrise to these feelings of empowerment,humility, agency, and gratitude.And reminded us several times that when\nwe are challenged, when we're not doingas well as we would like, that we need\nto look back to the structure of selfand the function of self and ask specific\nquestions in order to arrive or re arriveat this sense of agency and gratitude.Yes, I think it would be wonderful for\nus if you could just recap the overallmodel because it has the components that\nI just mentioned, but some subtlety andsome really key aspects of these pillars\nof structure of self and function of self.I think if people keep in mind for\ntoday's episode, which is aboutchallenges that people commonly face,\nand even, if you will, phenotypesthat we see commonly out there.For people that haven't heard of\nphenotypes, phenotypes are thetypical appearance of something.So there is the phenotype of the anxious\nperson, the phenotype of the person whojust can't seem to get out of a rut.There's the phenotype of the traumatized\nperson and these things play outdifferently in different individuals,\nmen and women, boys and girls.But we're going to visit many of the most\ncommon phenotypes out there and thinkabout how to do better, be better, feel\nbetter through the lens of the modelthat we spelled out in episode one.And of course, if people have not seen\nor heard episode one, today's discussionwill still be entirely accessible to them.So in keeping with that, if you could just\ngive us an overview of what this structureof the healthy self looks like as a\nroadmap for where we're all headed today.Paul Conti: Thank you.Thanks very much.Revisiting the pillars is, I think,\nthe best place to start, becausethere really are routes to understand.And if we understand, then we can\nstrategize, we can make change, right?We can make things better.So the first pillar, the structure of\nself, starts with the unconscious mind.This incredibly complicated biological\nsupercomputer that's firing a mile aminute underneath the surface in us and\nis throwing up to the surface all sortsof thoughts and ideas and states that\nthen the conscious mind apprehends.Then our awareness comes into play, and\nthen we have defense mechanisms thatsort of rise up from the unconscious\nmind, and they circle and sort of girdthemselves around the conscious mind,\nwhich they can do in an unhealthy way orin a healthy way or anything in between.And then the character structure is\nsort of the nest around all of that.And it's from the character structure\nthat we are engaging in the worldin the ways that we're engaging.It's our active engagement\nwith the world around us.And the idea is that the\nself grows out of that.It grows out of that nest sitting on\ntop of the unconscious mind to theconscious mind rising above the defense\nmechanisms and the character structure.And if we go back to that, when\nwe're trying to understand ourselves,trying to understand states of health\nas well as states of unhappiness orstates that aren't healthy, by going\nback and looking at the structure,we can learn a tremendous amount.And the other side, the other\npillar, is the function of self.And it really starts\nwith a self awareness.The awareness that, hey, there\nis an I, I am in the world.This is 24 hours in the day are\ngoing to pass today, and I'm goingto be doing one thing or another.I'm to some very significant extent\ndeciding how am I going to engage inthe world around me during that time.So on top of that are the\ndefense mechanisms in action.So defense mechanisms,\nremember, are unconscious.So there's a lot then going on\ninside of us that's determiningsort of the field set of options.There may be a lot of automaticity\nthat narrows down the set of optionsof what we may entertain, what we\nmay be aware of, what we may decide.And that could happen for better\nor for worse, depending upon thehealth of the defense mechanisms.But on top of that lies salient.So the idea then we would next visit,\nokay, what are we paying attention to.What's coming from inside,\nwhat's coming from outside.And we have to not pay attention to\nmany, many things in order to payattention to whatever our attention\nhas alighted on at the moment.So it's a complex process, and it's\nworth looking at very closely ifwe want to understand ourselves.So after thinking about the defense\nmechanisms in action, the unconsciousaspects of how we're engaging with\nthe world, then next to consideris salience, which is sort of\nwhere does the mind arrive at rest?Where does the mind trend towards?Is it something internal?Is it something external?What are all the things we're\nnot paying attention to in orderto pay attention to something?And is that thing healthy?Is it not healthy?Is it serving us well?So there's so much to\nunderstand about salience.And then the next step beyond\nthat is understanding behavior.How are we engaging with\nthe world around us?What are our behavioral choices?What are our automatic behaviors?And then sitting on top of\nall of that are our strivings.So we have a sense of wanting something\nin the world around us, and what isthat, and how are we trying to get\nto it, and how does it make us feel?So if we look at the ten elements, the\nfive under the structure of self andthe five under the function of self,\nthen what we're really looking at issort of like looking at ten cabinets.And if we're trying to understand\nourselves, whether we're trying to justgenerally understand ourselves or we're\ntrying to get at a problem, then lookingin all ten of those cabinets makes sense.Some of them will be bare, meaning that\nthey may seem to have very little todo with the problem we're bringing.And we kind of maintain an open mind.We may be led back to that cabinet,\nand there may be something there.But what usually happens is if we look\nin all ten places, we find a couplewhere there's some rich material to\nexplore, sort of the X marks the spot,and then we go and we dig there to sort\nof mix metaphors we dig in the cabinetwhere we're going to find something.And then it leads forward\na process of understanding.And if we're bringing those things into\nline, where we have a healthy structureof self and a healthy function of self,\nand we're aware of all of this and we'reworking on it, we're self aware, and\nwe're paying attention to everythingbuilt on top of that, then what we end\nup with is a sense of humility, becauseone cannot be anything but respectful,\ncompassionate understanding the complexityof all of this and understanding,\nhow does it manifest itself in us?And just the very fact that\nwe can make our ways in theworld, right, is so impressive.And in a way, I think it brings to\nus a respect, just a respect forbeing here, navigating the world.And I think of that\nrespect is born humility.The complexity of us, the fact that\nmillions of things are going on underneaththe surface, millions of neurotransmission\nand endocrinological function.All of this is going on under the surface.I'm not even aware of it.And then it kicks up to the surface,\ngenerates a tremendous amount ofrespect for the complexity and also\nthe diligence and perseverance ittakes us to navigate through the world.And I think built upon that\nunderstanding is a sense ofhumility and a sense of empowerment.And the humility and\nempowerment in action, right?So expressed, become agency and gratitude.And agency and gratitude, as you said\nat the beginning, we're seeing as verbs.That's how we're living life.It's through the lens, so to\nspeak, of agency and gratitudethat we're actively living.And again, I would put forth that\nwhen we look at measures of humanhappiness across disciplines and across\ntime, this is always what we see issome way of describing how agency\nand gratitude, together, as verbs,manifest and then create happiness.It's the state that we're seeking\nto be in, because from that state ofactive agency and active gratitude,\nwe achieve what it is that Ithink we're really searching for.And there are infinite words throughout\nhuman history to describe what that is.We might choose to use words like\npeacefulness, a sense of peace, a senseof contentment, being delighted by things,\nlike just being amazed and impressedby things in the world around us.Like, this is a state\nthat we're striving for.And I think when people talk about\nhappiness and what we're reallytrying to get to, it's this.But it's not that these\nthings are passive.These things are coming from the\nactive agency, the active gratitude.And they're then interacting with\na generative drive within us.We have an aggressive drive.We have a pleasure drive like this\nhas been thought about now for along, long time within mental health\nand validated in a lot of ways.But what hasn't been validated is\nthat they're the only things, right?We see human beings striving.We see human beings wanting better for\nthemselves and for the world around them.We see acts of kindness that\nseem to be rooted to nothingother than the act of kindness.We have within us a drive to know, to\nunderstand, to learn, to make better.And that has been described as many,\nmany things across human history.But I think the words we might\nchoose are a generative drive, adrive to create and to make better.And it's the generative drive as something\nactive within us that is then aligningwith agency and gratitude, the active\nways in which we express ourselves.And then that altogether brings\nus the peace, the contentment,the sense of delight.Sometimes that may exist\nin us in a state of rest.But very often it's existing\nin us in a state of activity.And that's why people find the quote\nunquote happiness, like what peopleare seeking, not just in meditation.Sometimes we can find it there, but\npeople also find it in action, right?They find it in doing that thing that\nthey love to do, or in taking careof someone and learning something.So when we look at all of this, we\ncan then have a route of understandingwhat is going on inside of us and\nhow we can make the changes thatlet us be in this state, which is\nreally the state that we are seeking.Andrew Huberman: I really appreciate\nthat you highlight that agency and"

            "text": "gratitude are verb states from which\npeace, contentment and delight emerge.And also the way that you explain\nthe generative drive that is distinctfrom aggressive drives and pleasure\ndrives that exist in all of us.I'm smiling because a number of\nexamples of peace, contentment, anddelight while in action come to mind.I mean, for me, podcasting, and in\nparticular, preparing for a podcast,trying to mine the literature and\nfigure out where the gems reside andwhere the confusion could emerge.And all of that brings about such\npeace, contentment and delight forme, but it's anything but passive.Likewise, yesterday had the\nexperience of running into a puppy.It's been a while since I've owned\na dog, and dogs are delightful.Puppies are particularly delightful.Paul Conti: I had the experience of seeing\nyou light up when you ran into the puppy.Andrew Huberman: You did, and\nI'm still buzzing from thatshort interaction with the puppy.Downstairs the way Mariner puppy.I don't know why, but I just delight\nin animals of most all kinds.Not a fan of reptiles, sorry, reptile fans\nso much, but I just drive so much energyfrom it, and it felt like life energy.And the way the animal is sort of\nattentionally scattered is amusingto me as compared to the dog that he\nwill eventually be, which is goingto be more linear in his thinking.It encapsulates so much of\nthe other things I love, likebrain development, et cetera.Anyway, I highlight those examples\nbecause there's nothing passive about it.It's pure delight and joy for me, and it\nintersects with other delights and joys.And I think that as you describe agency\nand gratitude, peace, contentment anddelight in these generative forces as\nwell as other forces that exist in us,I think it's really critical that people\nunderstand that these are not statesthat you sit down and place yourself\ninto, although perhaps one could throughreflection or meditation or waking\nup from a really great night's sleep,things of that sort, but that these are\nthings that we can find ourselves awashin if we are doing the right things.And those things can\noftentimes be very challenging.So assuming I understand the way the\nmodel is spelled out correctly, I'mmore and more delighted at the fact\nthat this is not just accessible inone domain, but is accessible in many,\nmany different domains for everybody.This is not something unique to my\nexperience, even though I give examplesfrom my own life, but that we really all\ndo have access to this if we're lookingin those cupboards, those ten cupboards,\nand asking the right questions and.Paul Conti: To maybe comment\neven a little further on theexperience of you and the dog.So it was an experience of delight.And you enjoyed it, and it brought\na sense of peace and contentment,like, all of that happens.But think about what that's linked to.I believe there's a strong sense of\nagency in you that you are enacting.There's a strong gratitude\nin you that you're enacting.You're handling your life in a way.And also for all of us, good things always\ncome with good fortune, but it comes withour strivings and our achievements that\nyou're in a place to delight in that.If you are unhappy, like, I don't\nlike what I'm doing, I'm angry,I'm frustrated, then there's no\nroom in you to find the delight.And the delight that you find is also\nvery much linked to the generative drive.It makes me think of how you\nloved and nurtured Costello.So you have it in you to love and\nnurture a dog, and you have donethat in a really wonderful way.And that generative drive is part\nand parcel of the delight youfeel when you see a dog, because\nyou love dogs and you think aboutnurturing, and it all comes together.The agency and the gratitude expressed\nas verbs puts you in a position tohave that sense of delight which is\nso intertwined with your generativedrive, with a sense of caretaking,\na sense of creating the beyond self.Because although you enjoyed\nand loved Casello, you enjoyedand loved his happiness, right?So it all comes together.And I think it's interesting\nbecause in some ways it's asimple example, but that's life.Life has its big moments, but so\nmuch of our lives are the smallermoments that link together.And I think that smaller\nmoment becomes a big example.Andrew Huberman: I appreciate\nthat you mentioned Costello.For listeners of this podcast that have\ntuned into early episodes, Costello wasthe source of the background snoring.For those of you that\nhaven't, you can go check.He was a 90 pound English bulldog\nmastiff who had many skills,the best of which was snoring.So in addition to the generative\ndrive, which is something that wecertainly want to talk more about\ntoday, you mentioned these other drives,"

            "text": "aggressive drives and pleasure drives.And much of what we're talking about\ntoday is going to be where people cango wrong or where people struggle.We are also, of course, going to go\ndeeply into where people succeed andin particular where people can ask\nquestions of themselves, in particularwhat is working for them and why, as\na route to understanding how to siftthrough those cupboards and understand\nwhat's not working and why, and comeup with real actionable answers and\nthen the ability to move forward.So if you would, could you tell\nus a little bit more about drives?Generally, when I hear drives, I\ncan't help as a neuroscientist,but default to, okay, the dopamine\ncircuit, or the endogenous opioidcircuit, or the serotonergic circuit.But how do you conceptualize\ndrives within us?And then perhaps you could tell us what\nthe nature of aggressive drives andpleasure drives and generative drives.Paul Conti: So the concept of a\ndrive, the definition of a drive, issomething that's intrinsic to humans.So we could look at it as a motivation.I mean, we don't just lie on the ground\nand do nothing until we passively die.So something is going on inside\nof us that is driving us todo something other than that.And historically, the thinking in the\nfield arising from early psychodynamicprinciples, the theory in the field that\nhas really dominated the field, eitherdirectly or indirectly, in so many ways,\nhas been that there are two drives withinus, that there's aggression and pleasure.And again, these are just words, right?So we could apply many, many\nwords, which is why, of course,we want to define what that means.So aggression, even though we're using\nthat word for it, because the wordfor it is commonly used, but it means\nsort of forward active engagement.So a good, healthy amount of aggression\nusing that word for the drivewould be a strong sense of agency.Too little aggression can be a\nproblem, then the person isn'tbringing themselves to bear.So there's too little in the way\nof self determination, forwardmovement, empowerment, agency, right.And in the same way, too much of\nthis drive becomes actual aggression.So the idea that I want more,\nand if I can't get it in certainways, I'll just take it, right.So it starts to become what we more\nmap to the word aggression, which wouldbe something negative in most cases.Andrew Huberman: Like a\ndesire or a tendency to harm.Paul Conti: Sure.As aggressive drives get higher,\nwhich you see why they're in us,because let's say we're defending\nourselves, or you're defending afamily member or like an entire family.Then it makes sense to have high levels of\naggression if your family is threatened.So those drives are in us at potentially\nthose high levels for a reason.But we certainly access very high\nlevels of aggression without theindication of preservation of\nlife or preservation of safety.The thought is, that's a drive\nin us, and that gets us up andoff the ground, so to speak.And that the other drive, then, is\npleasure, which, again, doesn't justmean that we all want to be hedonists.So pleasure could be even the\npleasure of relief and safety.We're all back in the cave together, and\nwe roll the stone in front of the door.We're safe.Throughout human development,\npleasure comes in a lot of ways.It can come through the pleasure of food\nor other people, friendship, romance, sex.There are a lot of ways\nwe can achieve pleasure.It can be relief of things that\nare unpleasant, relief of pain.But there's a drive towards\nthis in humans, which, again,really does make sense.And too little of it, again, can be\nproblematic because the person, then isn'tmotivated to sort of seek things because\nthey're not anticipating or don't receivegratification and too much of a drive\nfor pleasure can also create problems.We can kind of see how these two\ndrives, like, okay, they get us upand off the ground, so to speak.But the question is, do\nthey explain everything?And it's a very important question,\nbecause if they explain everything,then there's not room for behaviors\nand choices that are beyond the self.Right?There's not an explanation\nfor the person who.I'll give you an example of a person\nI've taken care of, who's just a verystrong swimmer, knows how to swim,\nhas swimmed throughout his life, whowas in a place, I saw video of it,\nwhere there had been a hurricane,and the waves were so frightening.They were just this huge surf, and there\nwere people who had gotten dragged out.And you just see him,\nhe runs into the water.He runs in and he goes.And he was really at risk.He needed to be saved\nhimself, but he saved them.And I do not believe you can\nexplain that through these drives.I don't think you can say,\nwell, he was aggressive.He wanted to go and do something that\nwas imposing himself on the world,or he got pleasure in thinking,\nI'm strong enough to go do this.I mean, I think we're really gyrating,\nwe're contorting ourselves, right,in order to explain it that way.If we think there's a goodness\nin that man's heart, like, Iknow there's a goodness in that\nman's heart, I know him, right?And that goodness sees him in the\nmoment, and he knows that maybehe can save them, maybe he can.He's not sure, but maybe he can.So the next thing you\nknow, he's in the water.And I think things like the love and\nnurturing of other people, of children,love and nurturing of animals, of plants.There are things inside of us that we\ncan't explain with those two drives.And I think they have led to\na very sort of darker way ofjust conceiving of humans.I think it's a reason why now you look\nat us in the modern day and age, we comeat humans through the lens of pathology.I mean, there's a very, very thick\nbook that if a person is assessing,another person is thinking about, like,\nokay, what numbers in that book apply.Which is like, that's not the way\nto go about understanding humans.And I think if we just think\nthere are those two drives, we'renot doing justice to humans.One, I think it's not true.I think it's evident that it's not true.And then if we're framing\nit in a way that's not true.We are not appropriately\nrespectful of humans.And if we come from what I believe\nto be the truth, that there is agenerative drive in us, a drive for\nthe beyond self, a drive to makethings better, whether it has anything\nreally directly to do with me or not.And as with the other drives, there\ncan be more or less, in people, acombination of nature and nurture what\ngenetically is in us, a predispositionbased upon the genetic lineage that\ncomes down to us and the recombination.And now we're a unique person with\na unique set of drives, but they areimpacted by the genetics and then they're\nimpacted by life experience, a morestrongly formative life experience.So the younger the person, the\nsort of deeper the impact of eventsthey have, nurturing versus abuse\non the array, on the relativeweighting of drives within people.But ultimately, we get to these\nthree drives and how they'refunctioning in a person, being a way\nof understanding and assessing howhealthy or not healthy the person is.And then we look back to those\nten cupboards for the answers.If we're finding things that we don't\nlike, those drives are out of balance.And here are the problems they're causing.So very, very concrete issues\nof problems in people's lives.We can look and see where\nis that out of balance.And if it's out of balance,\nthere's something in those pillarsthat are not in the right place.We can then go back and look in\nall those cupboards for, like, oh,where do we dig to find the answer?We learn things, we bring\nthings more into balance.So the pillars are in a healthier place.And then what sits on top of\nit, as you use the word geyser.The geyser that then comes up\nand floats everything on top ofit can do that in a healthy way.Andrew Huberman: Yeah."

            "text": "During episode one, we touched on\nsome of the similarities betweenunderstanding the self and building\ntowards a healthy or healthiest versionof self, where agency and gratitude are\nthese states that are being expressed.And one of the themes there was this\nidea, you know, people perhaps want to behealthy so that they live a long time, but\npresumably they also want to be healthyso that they can walk up flights of\nstairs, pick up their kids, move objects,not get injured, perhaps even do sport.And of course, some people want to be\nhealthy for aesthetic reasons as well.And if we were having a discussion about\nphysical health, we could address themajor pillars there, which were items\nwithin the covered, like most peoplewant some ability to have endurance\nor stamina to walk some distanceor maybe even run some distance.As I mentioned before, walk up a flight\nof stairs, have some strength, some degreeof flexibility, certainly some mobility,\nmaybe even dynamic mobility, et cetera.And in order to address those or improve\nupon those, they could look in thosecovers and say, well, how much running,\nswimming, long form cardiovascularexercise am I doing per week?How many steps am I taking per day?How many times a week do I lift objects\nthat are slightly heavier than iscomfortable for me to lift, et cetera?It's very tangible, very concrete.Here you're making the psyche and the\nself and mental health very much concretein some of the same way, saying, there\nare ten cupboards that one can look in,and these drives, as you refer to them as\ngenerative drive, aggressive drive, andpleasure drive, you'll probably tell us in\na few minutes, can be expressed to varyingdegrees in different people and how\nthat shows up and what that looks like.And I just want to frame this in\npeople's minds as very similar toaddressing whether or not, okay, if\nsomebody can run very long distances,but they're always having aches and\npains, or they feel weak, or they areweak, there are good reasons for that.They're overemphasizing\none form of exercise.The expression is more along the\nlines of endurance and stamina,not strength, or vice versa.The power lifter who can lift 750\npounds from the floor in a deadlift,but walks up two flights of stairs\nand is belly breathing and hasto stop at the top of the stairs.It's obvious in the physical realm,\nit's slightly more cryptic, or morecryptic in the psychological realm,\nbut here it's becoming concrete for us.Paul Conti: I think it's very\ninteresting and very ironic.Right?So the field that I'm in, the field\nof psychiatry, has historically wantedto be sort of part of the rest of\nmedicine, or like the rest of medicine.And what I believe it's ended up\ndoing is glorifying a taxonomy,glorifying a category, mechanism\nof understanding human beings.So in the way that if I'm practicing\ngeneral medicine and you come in andyou're congested, and I determine,\nlike, oh, you have bacterial sinusitis.So now I've made a diagnosis,\nand now I know what I'm going todo about that, okay, I'm going\nto prescribe an antibiotic.Now, the thought comes\nin of what antibiotic.But the identify sinusitis, now\nyou need an antibiotic, is likekind of how medicine works.So the thought was psychiatry is\ngoing to categorize everything.So we'd say, okay, I've listened to you\nlike, I know your number or your numbers.And then once I've given you the\nnumbers, now I know what to do.I prescribe this medicine, that\nmedicine, these many sessions ofa certain kind of psychotherapy.And that doesn't work.It doesn't work in mental health.It may.It's not that it never works,\nbut if you're going to try andunderstand people, it's different.A problem of self.If I have a lack of confidence\nin one area of life and not inothers, that's a significant issue.It is not like bacterial\nsinusitis, where then, okay, arrowgoes to prescribe antibiotic.And I think what is ironic is that this\nroute of approach actually does bringpsychiatry or mental health into line\nwith the rest of medicine, r ight.Which is why you can make that\nparallel and it fits well, right.When you're making the\nparallel to physical healthand to I want to be healthy.Okay, what are the components of that?What am I doing to achieve that\nif something's not the way I want?Let me go back and look\nat those components.It may be because it's more\ntangible, sort of essentiallyeasier to comprehend, right.Because it's more concrete.But I don't, in a sense, see it\nas cryptic, just less obvious.But if we go and we look at it and\nwe say, oh, that really makes sense.In a sense, it makes sense\nthat it makes sense, right?If there's a mechanism of understanding\nthat applies to lots and lots of thingsthat are more concrete, why would\na similar kind of mechanism, likeunderstand what the components are,\nunderstand what's built on top of them?This, I believe, is how psychiatry\nactually fits with the rest of medicine,not by glorifying a taxonomy, but by\ncoming through the lens of understanding.Andrew Huberman: Yeah,\nI couldn't agree more.And I think that what's so reassuring is\nthat both in terms of creating physicalhealth across the various domains of\nheart health, lung health, endurance,strength, et cetera, cognitive health,\nas well as mental health is verbs.It comes back to action items that\nwe each and all should engage in, inorder to arrive at the states and ways\nof being that we all want to be in.Right.We want to feel healthy,\nlook healthy, et cetera.We want to be happy.I know very few people who\ndon't want to be happy.I mean, certainly there are people\nwho give up, but we'll talk aboutthat today and routes out of that.But at the end of the day, it's all\nabout looking in those bins, askingspecific questions, and then moving\nforward in specific actions to get tothe place of empowerment, humility,\nagency, gratitude, peace, contentment,delight, et cetera, as opposed to simply\nusing words and understanding to arriveat insight and then stopping there\nand expecting everything to change.And I think that's where a lot\nof people are confused aboutpsychology, therapy and psychiatry.And as you mentioned, psychiatry has\nits own shadows, if you will, within it,where the use of drugs, which certainly\ncan be very useful, even life saving.Paul Conti: Absolutely.Andrew Huberman: Oftentimes is seen as\na fix all that somehow could reordereverything within the cupboards and\nmake the recipe just right, whenin fact, we'll talk about today.That is generally not the best route,\nbut again, with the understandingthat drugs can be very powerful, toolsPaul Conti: Play a role.Yeah, right.But it's important we understand\nwhat role is appropriate for them,and that's where we often go astray.Andrew Huberman: I'd like to take a\nbrief break and acknowledge one of"

            "text": "a better word, agency over their own\nmental health and self understanding, anddefining for them what action items to\ntake, I'd like to ask you about some ofthe things that I observe in the world\nand hear a lot about, in particularfrom the audience of this podcast.It's obvious to me that people\nvary in terms of their level ofaggressive drive, pleasure drive, and\npresumably generative drive as well.One common question is, how\ndo I become more motivated?Right?And of course, that opens up a\nbunch of other questions, like,are people afraid of failure?And that's why they're not motivated?Are people afraid of success?Is that why they're not motivated?Is there some underlying childhood\ntrauma or unconscious processthat's driving that fear?And so on?But if we were to take the psychiatrist's\nperspective, your perspective, ifsomeone comes to you and says, I\njust don't really feel like trying.School is hard, school loans are\nexcessive, which is true, by the way.It's not even clear that with a degree I\ncan do much, or I had a series of failuresin the work domain or in the relationship\ndomain, and they're just feeling weigheddown as if it's not worth trying.What does that tell you\nin terms of where to look?And what does that tell you\nin terms of their drives?I mean, do we conclude something\nabout their innate level ofaggressive drive or their pleasure\ndrive or their generative drive?I think there are many such people out\nthere, and then we'll consider someother kind of phenotypic examples.Paul Conti: So it's a great example\nbecause any good clinician could hearthat story and have thoughts about it\nthat could and would hopefully be helpfulwithout necessarily referring to drives.I think you can anchor any set of\nassessments, any evaluation, anyattempted understanding to drives,\nbut it doesn't have to be that way.So, for example, you might ask that\nperson more questions about whatthey're doing, how they spend their\ntime, because you're telling me aboutsomeone who's not getting enjoyment\nor gratification out of anything.And that then becomes of interest to me.Is there something this person does enjoy\nor something they'd rather be doing?Did they go to college and take on\na bunch of loans because they feltthat was better, because they thought\nthey were going to do somethingthat now they actually don't want\nto do ? Or that opportunity isn'tthere, and now they're frustrated?What is inside this person that\nmight seem different than that.And again, the answers\ncould be complicated.It could be.Maybe that person enjoys what\nthey're doing, but the cost ofliving where they are is so high\nthat they still feel miserable.There's a sense of privation, and then\nthat gets backmapped to like, I'm notgetting any pleasure out of anything.So the answer could be as simple as\nyou strategize with the person of,for example, does a person like that\nmove or move to a different area?There's so many ways of looking at this\nand so many ways of understanding this.But you're describing someone to me\nwho is kind of really complainingthat nothing is feeling good, right?Nothing's providing a sense of\nenjoyment or of pleasure, right?So I would probably be interested in that\nfirst and think maybe the pleasure driveis higher than what's being fulfilled.Maybe the pleasure drive is low, and\nthat's an issue in and of itself.We sort of learn those things.Maybe the aggressive drive is\nlow, and if that person just put alittle more energy into it, right.Like they could be in a different place.So you try and help the person understand\nthemselves so that you can make change.And again, that understanding doesn't\nhave to be anchored to the drives.But I do believe the drives are at the\nroot of all understanding, because ifyou sit with that person and you talk to\nthat person, then you're going to be ableto understand what is out of balance,\neither in the actual array of the drivesor in how they're being experienced.Because again, if you have a\nhigh pleasure drive, for example,and it's not gratified, right.That represents a problem.Andrew Huberman: What about people who\ncan experience some pleasure or can keep"

            "text": "busy, say, for instance, on social media\nor playing video games and I shouldalso say perhaps it's bringing them to a\nplace of peace, contentment and delight.But in some sense, it's\nnot really generative.I'm not going to cast judgment and\nsay that video games and socialmedia are all a waste of time.I mean, I'm on social media trying\nto provide value to people andlearnings, and I derive value and\nlearnings from other accounts as well.But there are these milestones,\nif you will, in life.I mean, not that everyone has to go to\ncollege and get married and have a family.There are a lot of different paths through\nlife that I would consider successful.But in some sense, there are milestones,\nlike we want to move forward.There's this phenomenon nowadays of a\nlot of young people so called failureto launch, like they're not leaving\nhome or they're not finding a vocation.They're not feeling as if\nthey're good at anything.Or they have the sense that unless\nyou're going to be top 1% insomething, it's not worth trying.But they can still find what most\npeople would describe as pleasures.Like they might enjoy food\nmaybe a little too much.They enjoy alcohol\nmaybe a little too much.They enjoy social media or video\ngames, maybe a little too much.And I say a little too much because\nit's providing more or less asink or a reservoir for their\naggressive and pleasure drives.That's not moving them forward in\nthe standard milestones of life.I hear about that a lot.I see that a lot.So it's a slightly more complex phenotype\nthan described before as just simplythe a motivated or non motivated person.But what do you think of the\nphenotype I just described?Paul Conti: Because we're unique.Each person is unique,\nalthough we fit categories.So there are categories a person\nthere could fit that could bedifferent from what I'm saying.But I think most people,\nthey say on balance.What is most prominent?I think what is most prominent in that\nsituation is there's something outof balance in the generative drive.\n And what you see a lot of times is\nthe person has a generative drivein them that's higher than their\nability to realize that drive.The generative drive then is frustrated.So I'll give an example.And it's a real true story of a person\nwho had worked very, very hard, goneto school for a long time, and had\nachieved a very high paying job.And that was the goal.It's a prestigious job,\nit's a high paying job.And the person for a while was doing quite\nwell at it, and things went relativelyrapidly in a negative direction.So maybe for a little while,\nthe person's doing okay.Then the person becomes very negligent\nof themselves and their environmentwhen they're not at the job.So the house is a mess, things are dirty,\nthe person is wasting time with things.So this is a person who enjoys\nit wasn't exactly video games.Let's say it could have been.Well, it enjoys them to a certain\ndegree and can really gain pleasureand feel good about the time spent.\n But starts spending too much time.Now what was pleasurable starts\nbecoming a distraction mechanism.And then what that transitioned\nto was overuse of alcohol.So now you have either something that\nis actually destructive and was negativeto job performance towards the person.This wasn't a person who was drinking\na lot before, and this is a person whowas miserable when they were drinking\nor they were sort of wasting their time.And we're aware of all of this.Well, there was a very clear problem,\nwhich is that that person had nointerest in what they were doing.None whatsoever.It felt like the majority of waking\nhours were spent in an automaton likeway, but being awake and aware of the\ntedium of it, the frustration of it.Andrew Huberman: The professional side.So they essentially had very little\nintrinsic curiosity or desire to do thejob that they were successfully doing.Paul Conti: Right.Which comes out only after exploration,\nbecause it seems like, well,what's going on with this person?This person has a good job and\ntheir life was going really well,and they're doing well financially.And is this person trying to\nnow overly indulge themselves?Is that why they're drinking?What's going on?And what you feel is that this person\nhad a strong, generative drive, and itwasn't met one little bit by what he was\ndoing, which was creating such frustrationinside that the person was either\ntaking himself online or doing somethingthat was punitive and self injurious.And this is a real story.The person exchanged that job\nfor a job that paid a 10th ofwhat the job they had paid.And the change in the\nperson's life was amazing.Like, I didn't know this guy could smile.He became happy.He loved what he was doing.He sold the larger house,\nbought a smaller house, kept itbeautifully, like he was happy.That's what he needed to be happy.Because then the generative drive in\nhim, he loved what he was doing, getsenacted, it gets expressed, and then\nother things can come then into line.He's not being over aggressive towards\nhimself and drinking too much becausehe's saying, oh, to help with you, to\nthe world around him and to himself.He's not taking something that\nserves a purpose in his life.Like, again, if the example had been video\ngames, it would be like, yeah, great.You enjoy doing that X amount of time and\ngo do that and get gratification from it,as opposed to then over relying on it.And then it's not providing gratification.It becomes a distraction.So those things came back into\nbalance in his life, but therehad to be the understanding.And I think there's a lot of that in\npeople who have a generative drive inthem that they feel is frustrated by a\nworld around them that isn't cooperating.Now, do I think we can understand that\nand change that in the vast majorityof people who are in that place.Yes, but it has to be\nlooked at first, right.Because it's not always that.It's just that a lot of the time.So it has to be understood\nwhat is it in that person?And then how do you go back to those\npillars and look at what's going on,that the person is in that place?Because the world can bring us\na lot of difficulties, right?And that person who now is saddled\nwith a lot more loans than they expect.I have tremendous compassion\nfor that and sympathy for that.That's real.Right?So people can be up against a lot of\nthings and that's just one of them, right?But it doesn't mean\nthat life can't be okay.It doesn't mean that, but the person has\nto feel that there's some way, they haveto understand enough about themselves\nto say, okay, this is what this is.And I kind of see what this\nis and why and how I'm here.And from there I can start to plot\na route to something that is betterbecause, yes, we have our difficulties\nand we can have a lot of them, right?But for the vast majority of us, it's\nnot like they're not surmountable.We have to just understand them.And let's say if that person goes and\nsays, I'm going to get some help, andthey go and someone says, okay, you get\nten sessions of cognitive behavioraltherapy and you try and like, how\ncan that person think differently?Then they'll feel differently.And look, cognitive behavioral\ntherapy has its place, right?But it's not going to solve that.That person needs to understand\nsomething about themselves, not redirecttheir thoughts to better places.So if the person gets a reflex, because\nthat reflex works well for the system,a reflex works well for the system\nthat's treating that person, for themedical system, the insurance system,\nthat person isn't helped one bit, right?And maybe a medicine can help.Maybe a medicine helps to just take down\nthe anxiety and the tension in the person.Then the person can sort\nof think more about it.And truly medicine did help this person\nbecause the idea of leaving the job.I'm leaving the prestige, I'm leaving\nthe money, is that okay to do like?It generated a lot of anxiety and\nit helped to kind of bring thetemperature down a little bit of\nthat so that he could think aboutit, engage in therapy, ultimately\nnavigate to where he wanted to be.Then we could back away from the medicine.So medicine has a role.But if he just got medicine, what\nare the odds of that helping?Like, zero, right?Because it's not going to make\nthe answers unless somehow theperson feels a little bit better\nand figures it out on their own.It's not how it works, right?So medicine has its place, but a kind of\ntherapy that recognizes the limitationsof medicine in most situations and\nis designed to really help the personunderstand, like, that's what we need.Andrew Huberman: The example you gave\nis a spectacular one because, as you"

            "text": "mentioned, medication had its place.Perhaps even redirection of thought in\nsome sense had its place, because, as Irecall, under the pillar of function of\nself, one of the key items is salience.What we pay attention to\ninternally or externally, whatour internal narratives are.But in staying with the example of this\nindividual, again as a phenotypic examplefor everybody to learn something from, the\nasking of better questions about oneselfis really what leads to the understanding.So, like, better forms of inquiry,\nto me, these better forms ofinquiry, better questions are really\nthe cardiovascular exercise, thestrength training, the flexibility\ntraining, the mobility training,coordination training of physical\nhealth just translate to mental health.Paul Conti: It's so interesting, right?Because if you think about it,\nin the example I gave, both thetherapy part through the system.The CBT has a place.And the medicine part also had a place.So both of those things have their role.But if we build the whole story of, like,\nthis is what this is, and this is howyou're going to be helped around those\nthings, we don't help that person at all.In fact, we ultimately, if you\ntake on balance, you take allcomers, we end up doing harm.Andrew Huberman: Well, in some ways,\nif we stay with the analogy of physicalhealth, it would be like the person\nwho wants to get in shape and then theyget a, i'm not picking on peloton as\na brand, but just a stationary bike.And they pedal every morning and they\nlose weight, their blood pressuregoes down, they're doing better.But then at some point, we know\nwith certainty that if you just dothe same form of exercise over and\nover again, sooner or later you'regoing to get overuse injuries.So then there's like the lower\nback piece and another pieceand you become out of balance.But I guess this is stealing\nfrom the Lance Armstrong book.But it's not about the bike, right?It's not about the bike.It's about the elevation of heart rate.It's about whatever other healthy\nactivities go along with exercisingfirst thing in the morning and all\nthe things that you're not doing as aconsequence of exercising in the morning.So it seems to me that these better\nlines of inquiry as the path to bettermental health, a better life, that sit\nunder these pillars of structure of self,function of self, are really the key.Paul Conti: But in this\nexample, the parallel that youmade is even more dramatic.It wouldn't be the stationary bike, right?Because a stationary bike is\nachieving a lot of ends, right.It would be more like telling\nthe person, you should walk morebriskly when you're going upstairs.That's a good idea, but that's\nnot going to make the change.So the idea that some CBT, some medicine\nmakes sense, it's more like that.It's not that walking more briskly up the\nstairs isn't a good thing, it's that wecan't build the story around your whole\nhealth is going to change based upon that.And then that's a problem.Then if the person thinks, just\nwalk more briskly up the stairs andyou'll be healthier, because when\nit doesn't work now they've failed.And this gets used a lot in mental health.That person failed this\ntherapy, failed that medicine.I think it's so also ironic because\nthat's often what the person internalizes.Well, they failed because we set\nthem up 100% for failure, right?Because we took things that have their\nrole, at least potentially have theirrole, and we built the whole story around\nthem because that story is convenient forthe systems that are providing the care.It's convenient for the healthcare\nsystems, it's convenient for the insurers.CBT packages very nicely.And you could see how if you start\nchanging thoughts and how theymake you feel like you can get some\nmovement on the surface, even ifthere's no movement underneath.And again, I'm not saying CBT is bad,\nbut to see it as the whole answerguarantees failure in so many situations.Same thing with the medicine.If you build the whole story\njust because it's convenient.And by and large, medicines\nare cheaper than people, right?So you can prescribe\nmedicines very reflexively.Psychiatrists with 15 minutes with\na patient that they can't thensee back for a couple of months.Like, how does that go well?The answer is it only goes well\nthe way a broken clock is right acouple of times, twice a day, right?I mean, look, sometimes it goes well\nwhere it just somehow it works out.And that person can do a little bit of\ntherapy in 15 minutes and choose the rightmedicines, but by and large, we do those\nthings because they're convenient for thesystems, even though that's why people\ndon't get better like we think they would.That's why they stay in systems.That's why they come in\nand out of emergency rooms.That's why they're not able to\nstop the drugs that end up onlybeing stopped when the person dies.This happens all the time, and we\ndon't stop it because we're comingfrom a perspective that is so limited.That's not saying, let's take a step back\nand look, can we really help someone?Can we really help that person understand?Can we help that person make change?Which ultimately would be, of course,\nso much better for the person andso much better for society, but\nis also better if we just look at,bottom line, dollars and cents.Because the short term view of\nit is cheaper today to have apsychiatrist at a 15 minutes\nappointment reflexively prescribea medicine that is cheaper today.Is that cheaper across time when that\nperson is utilizing more resources orthey're in and out of emergency rooms?It's so short sighted, which fits with\nmany ways in how our society works, right.That we want gratification and\nwe want gratification rapidly.That's why a person would accept\nthat their problems could bechanged by medicine, right?We're kind of conditioned that way.Andrew Huberman: Well, of course there's\nthe cost we don't see, which is thatperson doesn't get the opportunity to\nexpress their generative drive, and theconsequence of that is incalculable.Paul Conti: Right?Yes.And if we take a step back and we look\nat that, I think that what we will see isthat we have, it's not quite like painted\nourselves into a corner, but it's like theidea that if there's a beautiful tapestry\nthat's the size of the wall, that youcan see that only standing back from it.I mean, this goes back, I think,\na couple of thousand years,this sort of thought and idea.But if you come up too close to it, then\nyou can't see what it means anymore.And we're up so close to it\nthat we're thinking, well, okay,how could one parameter change?And can this person get a 15 minutes\nvisit sooner rather than later?Or how about this\nmedicine instead of that?And then it's like our noses are right up\nagainst the tapestry and we don't see thatwe're not doing right by individual people\na lot of the time, and we're not doingright by society, which then, if you stop\nand think about it, we're not doing rightby us because any one of us could be in\nthat position, and many of us have been inthat position being on the other side of\nthings and really needing help and needingto understand so any of us can be there.So if we're failing a lot of individual\npeople and we're failing the society, itdoesn't matter who we are listening to\nthis, ultimately we're failing ourselves.Andrew Huberman: I'd like to take\na brief break and acknowledge"

Huberman: Right.Paul Conti: But it's a good one, I\nthink, because the person left the money.Right.So it's like, well, what\nwould make you leave that?Right.Well, what would make you leave\nthat is if you're miserable in thesituation with that, and you're\nhappy in the situation without it.Andrew Huberman: Right.So it's about leaving misery\nand finding happiness.So if you'd be willing to share with us\na little bit of your mindset during thosesessions, meaning the sorts of questions\nyou asked him about the structure of hisself or to reveal the structure of his\nself and the function of his self thatallowed the both of you to eventually\nset him down this far better course.What's better than moving away from\nfrustration and overindulgence andmaladaptive behavior to deep satisfaction,\npeace, contentment and delight, andto become a generative human being.Paul Conti: Right.So we can look in each\nof those ten cabinets.Right?So let's say we look in the\nunconscious mind cabinet.There's not much there.When the person was growing up,\nit was very clear that having moremoney and having a job that impressed\npeople was an important thing.He internalizes some of it, so\nsome of it's unconscious, butby and large, he's aware of it.Andrew Huberman: And then\nthat was revealed to you how?You would ask him a question about,\ntell me about your upbringing.And he would say, yeah, money\nwas important to my family but Ialways felt like we had enough.He wasn't super wealthy,\nbut it had enough.When you say there wasn't a lot there, do\nyou mean that there was no kind of like,X marks the spot or blinking red light?Like, whoa, there's something really in\nhis unconscious mind that's in his way.Do I have that right?Paul Conti: Well, more\nbecause it was conscious.So he was aware that it was\nvery much like beat into him.Right?Like, this is the only way to be okay\nis to have a prestigious job that makesa lot of money but he's aware of it.If he weren't aware of it, we\nhave to bring that to light.Right?But he was aware.He's like, look, it\nhas a big impact on me.It makes it hard to step away.Like, I know I don't really care that much\nabout the money, but I also kind of do.Andrew Huberman: Sure, I always say money\ncan't buy happiness, but it certainlycan buffer certain stressors in life.Sometimes you hear people who have\na lot of money saying, like, moneycan't buy happiness because there\nare a lot of miserable rich people.But it's very different to have two night\nnurses to take care of a baby than to bethe person who has to stay up all night\ntaking care of a kid, especially, or asingle mother versus a mother that has\na partner who's willing to pitch in.You just can't comparePaul Conti: That's absolutely true.In this case, we're just looking at\nmoney as money as an endpoint, right?The idea that no matter what, how\nsecure and safe is more money better?And he had an intrinsic overvalue of that.So it made it harder to step away\nfrom it because he was overvaluing it.He knew he was overvaluing\nit just in and of itself.Not even for what it gets you, right?But for the psychological meaning of it.Then we look at his defensive structures.If we look in that cupboard, you see\nthat they've really shifted, right?They shifted from healthy places.Now they're sort of twisted and distorted.And he's doing a lot of denial, a lot\nof avoidance, a lot of rationalization.He's enacting a lot of\naggression towards himself.And he's doing a lot of projecting.He's harming himself with the alcohol.He's punishing himself.So his defensive structure,\nit can be healthy.We know that because it\nwas healthier, right?But then we see that it is so twisted.So we learn a lot from that, right.A lot is conscious in this person,\nthe defensive structure, can behealthy because it was healthy...Andrew Huberman:\nEventually it was healthy.Paul Conti: Well, it was healthy before.Andrew Huberman: I see.Paul Conti: It was healthy before.So you know that it can be healthy again.He has it in him to have healthy defenses.They just started getting away from him\nas he felt less and less satisfied withhis job and more and more angry with\nhimself and more and more miserable.Andrew Huberman: This is a\nreally key point for me andeveryone else to understand.Throughout the years of high school and\ncollege and friends and things of thatsort, I would hear this like, \"I used to\nbe really good at fitness, or if I hada dollar for every time someone said,\nyou should have seen me in high school\".Like, the person who lets themselves\ngo and arguably is very busy withprofessional duties and family\nduties, and you can understand whytheir time is more compressed than\nit was when they were in high school.But nonetheless, you hear these\nsorts of things all the time.I used to have this sense of I could\ndo things or that things could workout, and then it's as if there was a\nprevious version of themselves thatis completely atrophied and the new\nversion of themselves or the laterversion of themselves rather just simply\ndoesn't have access to that anymore.Paul Conti: That's the impact of trauma.Whether it's big trauma or it's\na big event or it's multiplethings, like, oh, the world just\nisn't rewarding me, I'm trying.The world's not rewarding me.I'm trying.The world's not rewarding me.Then people become\ndispirited, demoralized.It's the trauma of that that takes away\nthe sense of self, the sense of agency.Like, I thought I could do things before,\nnow I don't think I can do things, right.But nothing has really changed in me.That's a problem and it's a problem.The vast majority of\ntimes it's born of trauma.Andrew Huberman: Does that necessarily\nmean early childhood trauma?Or I suppose it could\nbe later life trauma.I mean, one of the things that I like\nabout what you're saying so much is thatyou, the psychiatrist, hears, I used to\nbe able to do something well or feel well.And that's like, it\nsounds like is a signal.It's really a beacon of health that\nstill exists in the person, butthat they're out of touch with.I think for most people, when they think\nabout themselves or people who talkabout how they used to be functional\nin some domain, and they're no longerfunctional in that domain any longer.It sounds as if things\nare fundamentally broken.It's as if a piece of them\nthat was functioning driftedout of their body and left.But I love the optimism, because\nI think so much of what we'reinterested in covering today is not\njust what's not working and why,but also what's working and why.And what used to work and why.And the idea that within these cupboards\nthere can be the discovery of problems.Clearly, that's why one goes to the\ncupboards as we're defining it, butthat there are a lot of answers.The ingredients for success\nalready exist within us.Paul Conti: Especially if we know\nwe've had that ability before, right?Because we know that we had it before.So think about in this man."

            "text": "He felt that he couldn't make change.Like now he's stuck.I got a lot of things done.I was able to get myself into this school\nand achieve this and then get this job.He could do all of those things.But now he feels like he can't do\nanything to make himself happy.So we know he could do that.He had a strong sense of agency.He does it now, right?And like people often do,\nthey feel a sense of loss.Like, naturally, I've had\nthis happen in myself.It feels like something's cut out\nof you and there's something hollow.I had that thing, and now I don't.Hence the I'm broken, I'm hopeless.The things that we hear over\nand over and over again.So think about the shift in this\nperson to what's actually going on,which isn't that hard to discern.We just pay attention to it.So then if we run up the structure of\nself, we say, okay, not a lot of it isrooted in the unconscious mind, right?There are problems of overvaluing certain\nthings, but they're in the conscious mind.Andrew Huberman: He knows.Like in his household, over dinner,\nit was dad or mom being proud of somedollar amount that they had achieved.So that narrative exists.And he's like, yeah, money was a\nbig deal in my family kind of thing.By the way, I'm not\nspeaking about my family.Rarely were their discussions about money.There were discussions about\nother things, of course.But in this hypothetical.Sorry.Paul Conti: He knows.He overvalues it, right?He knows that independent of what money\nbuys and what he needs and all that, hejust puts too much importance in money.And he knows that.Right?So, okay, they're conscious mind issues.He's pretty aware of them, and\nthey're pretty kind of set in him.Like those are the\nissues, and they're there.Okay, we learned that.Then we go look at his\ndefensive structure.Boy, that's very, very\nhelpful to talk about.Wow, you had a very healthy\ndefensive structure.What were you doing before?A lot of sublimation.Right?Andrew Huberman: Could\nyou explain sublimation?Paul Conti: Yeah.Take anxiety or tension or something\nnegative in the self, or thatcould be negative, and you channel\nit towards something positive.He channeled that energy towards learning.He channeled some of the\naggressive drive into a senseof agency that got achievement.So he looked and he said, right, that\nnetwork of defense mechanisms thatcomes up out of the unconscious mind\nwas like looking pretty good, right.It was pretty clear.Light was coming through it in\na way that wasn't distorted.And now we could look at, wow, things\nare pretty different now, right?As he's saying, no, it's\nokay what do you mean?I spent 10 hours of my\nweekend utterly wasting time.And what's wrong with that.Or he's rationalizing even that\nhe likes to drink when he doesn'tbecause he's so mad at himself.Like the defensive\nstructure now is twisted.So we can say, okay, that's\na big observation, right?And then the character structure,\nwhen we look at that, we find aperson who's pretty good at figuring\nout and understanding things andcoming right up to the precipice of\nchange, but has a long history ofthen difficulty making the change.I know it, and I'm on the verge of\nit, but I can't bring myself to do it.That's in his character structure.Andrew Huberman: By the\nway, s uch a common thing.I mean, people that know\nbetter know they know better.Sometimes you almost have to\nwonder whether or not it's likea medication in the pocket.Like, they could take\nit if they wanted to.That might even give them some comfort.But they just don't do it.They just don't engage in the\nproper actions to move theirlife from one place to the next.Paul Conti: And if we look\nthen at the level of strivings,he does know what he wants.He wants a feeling of contentment.It's really what he wanted was a\nfeeling of contentment, a feeling oflike, I'm taking good care of myself.I'm doing something that's of value.I'm enjoying doing it.He wanted those things.And even when we talked more, he had\nideas of what jobs would do that inthe beginning, he said he had no ideas.What he really meant that he said to\nme, but was also saying to himself,is, I have no ideas of jobs that would\nmeet these requirements for me thatpay as much as the one I have, right?But within him, which we got to\nwhere he knew that there werejobs that would make him happy.He just had to get over\nthat they were lower paying.So think of what we learn about that.There's nothing lost in this man.There's nothing cut out of him.He's not damaged, he's not hopeless.And now he can understand that.He understands himself\nactually pretty well, right?And his conscious mind is\napprehending pretty well what'sgoing on and where he wants to go.But, boy, as he hasn't taken good\ncare of himself, the defensivestructure gets sort of warped.And then it makes it a lot\nharder to take care of yourself.It starts making other problems in life.And he starts feeling lousy about himself.Like, maybe I can't do\nmuch of anything right.Why?Because work isn't going as well.Because he's drinking too much\nand role performance goes down.So we can see that.And then what's of most interest there\nis that there's a character structurethat can come right up to the precipice\nbut not pull the trigger, so to speak,on what the thing the person wants to do.Because now we start getting,\nokay, an understanding ofwhat's actually going on, right?And then if we look at function of self,\nlet's look in those cabinets too, right?To help him be more aware of."

aware\nof what's going on inside of me.And it can make me happy or\nit can make me miserable.Let's be more aware of that.Andrew Huberman: How did\nhe go about doing that?Because I find this first step within\naddressing the function of selfawareness and really understanding\nthat there's an I, there's a me,and I'm moving myself through life.I find this to be so interesting and\non the one hand, kind of obvious.Like, okay, there's a\nme, like, tangible thing.You look in the mirror, you see yourself.But at the same time, it's a\nbit abstract, I think to meand to many people out there.How does one go about building up a\nsense of self in a way that providespositive agency in the world?Is it to tell?We hear all the time\nabout these affirmations.And I'm sure there are people\nwho look at themselves in themirror and say, you are enough.And I'm not making fun of these people.Right?I actually have my own internal\nlist that I tell myself on wakingevery morning, which has nothing\nto do with positive affirmation.It's just actually defining the\ndifferent roles that I play.I don't know why this is useful to me,\nbut I find it incredibly useful to me.It reminds me who I am.It also reminds or reassures me\nthat I don't have any dementia yet.So we'll see going\nforward, but hopefully not.But yeah.Let's talk about this line of\ninquiry within the category ofself awareness that people can do\nregardless of whatever challengesthey might be having or not having.What does that look like and what\ndo you think that accomplishes atthe level of self understanding\nand agency in the world?Paul Conti: So one way of looking\nat that is, and it's not the wordsI would use, but what's pervading a\nperson and sort of setting the stage?Which you can discern by inquiry.For example, in this case, the person.So there's a person who would\nreally not think, this is okay.This person taking a job at\n10% of the previous pay andthe job has less prestige.Who's a person who would be very unhappy\nabout that and very faulting of that.And talk to this person, my\npatient, through the lens of that,he should feel shame for that.That person's not alive.The person is not alive.So one way of looking at is\nwhat master are you serving.And a lot of the givens.The automaticity in him was as if that\nperson was alive inside of him, reallytelling him how this wasn't okay.He was fighting that he wasn't aware that,\nhey, that's some other person's voice.He's like, no, I'm very,\nvery conflicted about this.Actually, he wasn't very\nconflicted about this.When he starts focusing on the\nI, what do I actually think?What do I actually think?I don't care if I make 90% less.Like, I don't care.My needs are met.I put some money away.I want to be happy.I'm not conflicted.But in order to get there,\nwe have to look at the I.How much is the I at center stage?I don't mean in some way of paying\ntoo much attention to the self, butwe're all acting through the lens of\nthe I, no matter what we're choosing.So to be aware of that and do\nI want to be impacted by theopinions of this other person?Because I can let someone\nelse's opinions very much.I mean, we all do, right?Very much impact my thoughts.But I want to kind of decide that, do\nI really value that person's opinions?I don't want them automatically inside my\nhead telling me how I feel about myself.Andrew Huberman: I can't tell you how many\npeople I know come to me in a place ofstruggle, even though I'm not a clinician.And as I listen to what they're struggling\nwith, it's so clear that they know thebest answer and route forward, but that\nthey're dealing with some internal,oppressive voice about whether or not\nthey are a good person or a bad person,whether or not the choice they want to\nmake is really a good choice at all.Sometimes those voices are the\nvoices of parents in these particularexamples, or the voices of peers.And so I think, if I understand correctly,\nwhat you're talking about is gettingreally firmly rooted in who a person\nis for themselves and what they reallyvalue and what they really know to be\ntrue for themselves and really trying tonot necessarily quiet those voices, but\nsee those voices truly as other, eventhough they come from within their head.Is that right?Paul Conti: Yes.To stop and think, what\nvoices do I want inside?So maybe I want the voice of a\nkind mentor who still held me toaccount for a very high standard.It's a good voice to have inside of me.Andrew Huberman: A few of those.Paul Conti: But what might not be\na good voice is like, say, a notso kind mentor for whom you could\nnever do anything good enough.That's not so good.Or maybe you take part of that\nand you leave part of that.But the earlier and more formative\nthe voices are, the more they'rein our head automatically.Like, think about that man thought\nthat he was deeply conflicted.Absolutely, 100%.And he was right.Like, his experience was\nto be deeply conflicted.But when you go in and dig, if\nyou just dig and you get to like,okay, the I is going to assess\nthis, he's not conflicted at all.Which is why then if you're coming up\nthe function of self ladder and you look"

hey, the defenses are\nshifting to denial, acting out.And that's what sort of gives us\na time horizon, like this thing.This is not going to be okay.That if he kept down this path, what\nwas very clearly going to happen.You don't have to roll the tape\nforward that much to see thathe's going to lose his job.He's going to feel very ashamed of that.Like a bunch of negative\nthings are going to happen.So it helps the person apprehend\nthat there's something going on here.I'm changing, right.Because in some way I'm thinking now\nthat it's okay that I'm wasting 10hours on something that I could really\nenjoy if I spent 90 minutes on it.Whoa, I'm kind of losing a\nlittle bit perspective there.So it adds a sense like\nit frames the situation.And the salience of it.Andrew Huberman: Could you elaborate\na little bit on this defensemechanism in action of acting out?I think we covered in episode\none, and I'm sure we'll come upseveral times more during today's\ndiscussion about things like denial,projection, displacement, et cetera.Those defense mechanisms seem to\nhave their own intrinsic definition.But acting out is something that we\nhear more and more about these days.Like, they're acting out.What is acting out?Is it acting out of some conflict?Is it trying to demolish a struggle\nby going and doing something else?Paul Conti: We can think of it as, by\nand large, an unhealthy manifestationof a lot of aggression, which could\nbe a very high aggressive drive or anaggressive drive that's not too high,\nbut is then furthered, its power isfurthered by a negative situation.Say, like this one.Because the acting out, what\nwas going on here inside of thisperson is he was very, very mad.And this isn't a person who expressed\na lot of anger or had outlets for.He wasn't going and running 10\nmiles or this was all inside of him.He wasn't getting it out\nin one way or another.So what he starts doing is he\nstarts acting out the anger.Now, he's angry at the world around\nhim because he's unhappy in it, andit's not giving him more choices.Now, of course, this is about\nhim and not the world around him.But he's feeling an anger towards\nthe world that won't cooperate.Right.And he's angry towards himself.Because he can't make himself happy.Look at all of this.Look at all that he did, and\nlook how miserable he is.So a way of acting out\nthen is the drinking.Because the drinking is to\nhell with the world, right?You think I shouldn't be drinking at\nnight and coming to work hungover?I'll do it anyway, right?To hell with the world.It's a way of snubbing\nhis nose at the world.He's also snubbing his nose at him, right?To hell with me, right?The guy who now doesn't come across\nthe way he did before, becauseI'm showing up at work, not in the\nresponsible way I showed up before, butin a way that's a little disheveled.Function is lower.To hell with me.It's a form of self denigration.Like, let people think worse of me.Why?Because I'm so mad at myself that\nI think it's justified, right?And then there's also the inviting\nof, hey, if I really have anaddiction problem here, I lose my job.It's like, fine, I\ndeserve that too, right?There's an acting out against the self\nthat if the person doesn't stop and lookat that, that can become true, right?Because that person didn't really wasn't\nbuilt to say to hell with the world andwith me, or to not even understand that,\nwhat's the hell with the world mean?It also means to hell with me.And it's not good for the or me.But he was able to understand\nthat because we would look at,like, wow, what shifted in you?This is a person who did a lot of\nsublimation before, who now allof that's going into acting out.So they're not taking negative energy\nand doing something good with it.They're taking negative energy and\ndoing things that are bad with it.Why?Because there's too much.There's a lot of negative energy.It's overwhelming everything else.And then it's going down these\npathways where the unhealthydefenses are always beckoning us.Send the energy down here.It's easier to avoid than it is to\nface something and figure it out.It's easier to just act out than it\nis to hold what's inside of us andthen think about why it's there.So the unhealthy defenses\nare beckoning us.And for him to see you have had\na healthy defensive structure,like, you can be healthy again.You're not broken, right?But to also see the way these defenses\nare going is bringing real risk toyour ability to even be happier.You get further down the shame and\nloss path, it can be hard, sometimesimpossible for the person to get back.So it sets the stage.Like, this is very, very important,\nwhat these defenses are, how they'rebeing enacted, and for him to be\nable to see that, like, oh, thiscould be healthy, but it's not now.Andrew Huberman: Yeah.These slow, degrading forms of acting\nout and self sabotage and sabotage ofothers, I think, are the particularly\ndangerous ones because they're slow.And sometimes the change\nis imperceptibly slow.And then one day somebody arrives\nat a place where, as you said, theyunfortunately can't get back, or it\nrequires going into residential treatmentor things that really big departures\nin order to get back into life.And I would never wish for\nsomebody to choose to act outby driving off a cliff instead.But there are other forms of acting\nout that immediately wake people up.But it seems like people\ndon't often select those.They select these more subtle forms\nof acting out where they don't getcaught or no one's calling them out on\nit because plenty of people have fiveor six drinks at happy hour, right?As opposed to 50, right?So it's slow self sabotage as opposed\nto immediate self destruction.And again, we're talking about alcohol,\nbut we talk about food, video games,social media, arguing with spouse.I mean, all of these kinds of things that\nbuild up over time to eventually deliverpeople to a place of real problems.I'm curious, for this particular\nindividual you worked with, soundslike that's not what happened.They started this process of self\ninquiry around self awareness.And did you see that the salience\nthat is what they paid attention tointernally and externally immediately\nshifted and the defense mechanismof acting out immediately dissolved.I mean, what was the kind\nof contour and time course.Paul Conti: There was less.If we're looking in the cabinets, there's\na lot in the defence mechanisms in actioncabinet, there's not as much in the\nsalience cabinet because this is the majorthing on his mind right above all else.And he was having intrusive thoughts\nabout it and his self talk was about it.But we kind of already knew that, just\nlike we knew it was in the conscious mind.So if you think, where's the money at?It's not as much in that realm\nbecause he's aware of it.If he thought, oh, this\nisn't bothering me very much.And then he said, well, all his internal\ndialogue is about it, right then,okay, there's a lot to achieve there.But just as he brought a lot that\nwas unconscious into the consciousmind, was aware of it, it was salient.There's less to do there because\nthe things to understand and changeare not residing so much there.Andrew Huberman: For people that are, no\ndoubt everyone is thinking about their"

            "text": "own internal processes and where they\ncould ask better questions and arrive atbetter answers to help themselves along.Perhaps you could elaborate a\nlittle bit more on this saliencecupboard under function of self.To me, salience is what's most apparent.As you talked about yesterday and\nagain today, there's this internalnarrative, like what's on my mind\noften or what kind of jumps to mind.I've started doing this recently based\non our discussions here, and I've noticedthat under different states of arousal.And here I'm talking specifically about\nsleepiness versus alertness type arousalwhen I wake up in the morning or when\nI'm tired in the evening, where my mindis at, where it defaults to and what I'm\npaying attention to throughout the dayis that just asking myself to notice,\nand I've certainly noticed some patterns.For instance, I've noticed that anytime my\noverall state is elevated, more alertness,or in the middle of exercise, my mind\ngoes to some not so pleasant thoughts.And it's interesting to me,\nit's like, wow, this is stronglycorrelated with states of\ninternal arousal that are healthy.Exercise within a limited frame\nor exercise in general, if donein a healthy way, is healthy.And when I'm sleepy, those\nthoughts never come about.When I wake up in the morning,\ncertain thoughts tend to leap to mind.Other thoughts know.So sort of categorization of\ndifferent types of thoughtsdepending on my internal state.Is that the sort of line of inquiry that\nyou're suggesting or describing here?Paul Conti: Yeah, I think it's quite\nhalf the picture, because half thepicture would be what's going on in your\nmind when your mind is sort of at rest.What then starts playing\nitself right in your mind.The other side of it is what\ncomes to the fore when there's alot of competition for attention.So I'm making this up, but the idea\nthat if he stubbed his toe really badly,he'd still be thinking about this.Because it's so much power.Now, again, maybe if, God forbid, he has a\nbadly broken bone, there's a lot of pain,like he's going to think of that first.But it takes a lot of other stimulus\nto be more salient than this.So you can look at what's coming\nin your mind when your mind issort of free and open, that's\nvery, very important and relevant.And then what's winning out when\nthere's maybe a high arousal state anda lot of competition for attention.Andrew Huberman: That's very helpful.Again, I think that along with this self\nawareness piece, the asking of oneselfwhat is happening in my mind when I'm\nin different states or throughout theday, and as you're describing now,\nalso including when there are otherthings available to think about.Does that include how often I'm\ndistracted by a particular thought?Like how many times throughout the\nday my mind goes from the conversationI might be in to something else?Paul Conti: Yes.Does it hijack your attention?Is one way of putting that.Andrew Huberman: A lot of people mention\nto me challenges with intrusive thoughts.What can be done about\nthose intrusive thoughts?Or is it simply a matter of paying\nattention to the fact that they'rethere and then thinking about\nthe origins of those thoughts?Paul Conti: Right.Absolutely.One example, you could have intrusive\nthoughts because there's trauma inyour background, maybe very clear\ntrauma that you're not facing andaddressing, and then you have intrusive\nthoughts that say, I'm not safe.Okay, go look for what's\nstill in the unconscious mind.Or when it comes out a little bit, you\npush back into the unconscious mind.That's a very different scenario\nthan, like, in this case.This man was having intrusive thoughts\nabout his job situation, his overallsituation, and it made sense that\nhe was having those intrusive.They were markers of the acuity of it, of,\nlike, you have to do something about thisor something very bad is going to happen.So the intrusive thoughts there.And this made sense, right.This is not going well, and your\nmind is sort of forcing you topay attention to this because time\nreally kind of is of the essence.You're at real risk now.So intrusive thoughts can be anything\nfrom, as they often are, they can bemarkers of something that is traumatic,\nsomething that's underneath the surface,something that is really bothering us,\nthat we've shoved down, that's makingguilt, shame, distress, vulnerability.That's very often the case.But sometimes intrusive thoughts\nare a marker of like, oh, right.That's the thing to pay attention to.Andrew Huberman: And once we identify the\nintrusive thought, how do we eradicate it?"

            "text": "I mean, how do we work with it?Talking about trauma now, of course, it\nmight map back to a childhood experience,some internal narrative, but is there\nsome roadmap for moving intrusive thoughtsfrom a place of intrusive and disturbing\nto simply there and kind of, meh.I mean, it'd be wonderful to hit\na delete switch, but obviously,we don't work like that.Paul Conti: Well, let's take a look,\nif we could, at this example, right,which is a little bit different if we\nrun through this example of the personin the job, because then we should talk\nabout trauma driven intrusive thoughts,which is, I think, in many ways, the\nbiggest topic about intrusive thoughts.But think of this person here.If we go up from salience,\nwe look at behaviors, right?And behavior actually now is\nvery, very important, right.This person is drinking.They're still going to\nthat job they don't want.They haven't gone and interviewed\nfor the jobs they want.So we start looking at the behaviors\nthat are making problems, the changes inbehaviors that could make things better.And then on top of that,\nwe arrive at strivings.And I think when I was talking about\nstructure of self, I think at least onetime I misspoke and said striving instead\nof self at the top of these pyramids, selfand striving have a lot of overlap, right.Because if you're growing a healthy self\nout of the sort of top of the structureof self pyramid, then that self is\ngoing to be aware of strivings and it'sgoing to be better able to enact them.So his sense of self was shaken\nhere, but he was aware of thestrivings for a better life.So now let's see the roadmap.It's interesting, right?Because the roadmap is his roadmap.If we look in those ten cupboards,\nwe come up with a roadmap, and theroadmap doesn't have us spending very\nmuch time in unconscious land, right.Because he doesn't really need that.If we look at what makes the\ndifference for him, what did we do?We really cultivated the self awareness,\nthe I that is making decisions for him.We looked at how his defensive structure\nhad changed and the things he didn'twant to be there now and the good\nthings that were there before, andhow could he get back some of that?How could he trend back towards\nwhat was working before?So we start to really look at\nthat and then we go from therereally to changing behaviors.Like it requires a behavioral\nchange, which is not to walk up tothe precipice of doing this each\nday, but to actually do it, right.Because it was very clear all the\nvectors, so to speak, inside ofhim were pointing towards doing it.And that that was consistent with\nthe self being healthier, that gardengrowing on top of the structure and\nthe strivings then being realized.So for him, that was the roadmap and\nthe salience, it wasn't really partof it, because the intrusiveness, the\nsalience bias inside of him made sense.And then, of course, it went away\nonce he made the decisions, right.Because the intrusive thoughts of,\nlike, you have to figure this out.You have to figure this out.Weren't there anymore, along\nwith the intrusive thoughts of,you'll never figure this out.It goes away because he made the\nchange, but he made the changebecause we looked at self awareness\nand we strengthened self awareness.We looked at defense mechanisms, how\nthey could be versus how they are.We looked at the behavioral\nchange, which was really necessary.And then also referencing a character\nstructure that has difficulty.Coming across the precipice.So we say, okay, that's a\nbaseline characteristic of him.We kind of understand that.But how do we help him\nchange the behaviors anyway?When he does that, the self is in\na better, happier, healthier place.The strivings are realized.This person stops drinking\nin the way they were.They start doing the enjoyment\naspects of their life.They start doing them within\nreasonable bounds again, they'retaking care of themselves.Person's smiling and now think the\ngenerative drive is much more fulfilled.What comes on top of those pillars, right.Is that person has a sense of humility.Enough humility to say, I'm\ngoing to walk away from this job.It's okay that people in the\njob will think I'm crazy.How could you leave that?And it triggers something\nin me in some way.But it's okay.I'm not out there for that.I'm not out there for the big\nthing that everybody is guiding.I can have the humility to go\nto the job that I know makes adifference and feels good to me.He's empowered to make change.He's moving away from the disempowerment\nof the alcohol and the avoidance.So there's empowerment and humility\nand absolutely, if you talk to thatperson on the other side of it, like\nshortly as he was enacting it, right.Getting just to the other side of\nit, there was so much empowermentand so much humility, which were\nthen brought to bear through a senseof agency that made the changes.That changed the job, that stopped\ndrinking, that dealt with the peoplewho thought negatively of it through a\nsense of gratitude of, it's not awfulthat I'm going to go make less money.A lot of people said that to him.Like, how could you do it?It was so terrible.It's not terrible.I'm grateful.You know what I'm going to do?I'm going to go make an amount of money.That's all that I need.So it was like, that's what\nhelps a person do that thing.And that's actually true.That's what mattered to him.So an activated, an active, a verb,\nsense of agency and gratitude, thenleads him to the place where there\nwas at peace, contentment, delight.He was delighting in the job\nthat he chose, and his generativedrive was in accord with it.Then eventually, we stopped at\nsome point, working together.He didn't need me anymore.He could always come back,\nbut we didn't need me anymore.Then you look at.How are those last sessions?A lot of the last sessions were\nhim in an excited way, tellingme what he was doing, right.Like, oh, and then we\ndid this, and I did this.I figured this out.He was so happy about it.And you can see that man's generative\ndrive, which naturally is quite highin him, but was being squelched.That brings him out of balance.Now, the generative drive was in quite a\ngood place, and he had enough aggressionor assertion to go and do that job and\nto do that well, and even enough tocounter anybody who would still kind of\nrise up and say, that wasn't a good idea.He could counter all that.He was getting pleasure from it.He didn't need to seek pleasure.By what?Not even pleasure?Because alcohol was pleasurable?No, pleasure.Because harming himself and\nsaying, to hell with you, to theworld, and to him was pleasurable.He's not getting pleasure that way.He's getting pleasure in healthier ways,\ntaking care of himself, doing the jobhe loves, doing his leisure activities.Like, the man comes into\nbalance, and then life is good.And when you say, yeah, okay, come back\nin a couple of months, comes back in acouple of months, maybe in six months.Comes back one more time,\nI don't see him again.That's great.He totally doesn't need me again.And I atrophied from his life.Great.That's the success state of it.Andrew Huberman: He eventually\narrived at being truly wealthy withall the components of mental health\nand peace, contentment, delight.As you describe his story, which is\na remarkable one, it occurs to me"

            "text": "that the narratives that we hear as\nchildren end up being so powerful.Paul Conti: Yes.Andrew Huberman: And I'm sure there are\npeople out there that receive such directmessages from their mother and or father.Like, you have to do this.You cannot do that.But often we get messages through\nobserving and overhearing.Right.The way that our mother talks about\nour father when he's out of the room.The way that our father talks about\nour mother when she's out of the room.And some of this could be nonverbal,\nlike a rolling of the eyes or somebodysaying, yes, yes, agreeing, and\nthen they walk out and they just.And kind of blowing them off.I mean, kids are, we are all so aware\nand integrating all of that all the time.And I do think those messages get\nwoven into us at a very deep level.Paul Conti: Absolutely.Andrew Huberman: And then, of course,\nthere are the conscious narrativesthat we build up as we go through\nin particular, I think, elementaryand middle school and high school.I mean, I can still remember a\nnegative comment somebody made abouta jacket that I was wearing in,\nlike, the third or the fourth grade.I forget everything else\nthat happened that year.Remember that?Yeah.And I'm not insecure about\nthe clothing that I pick.I mean, obviously it's a\nblack button down shirt.I've had similar shirts\nsince the first grade.Just kidding.But the fact that that's embedded\nin my memory systems is, like,just speaks to the salience of\nnegative, of insults basically.It was an insult.And I'm sure I've insulted plenty\nof kids coming up as a teenagerand back and forth, but these\nnarratives get so deeply embedded.And the idea that one could pick a\ndifferent path of vocation or, like, youmiss the opportunity to be truly happy at\na deep level based on these narratives.I mean, on the one hand, it's obvious.On the other hand, you just go\nlike, whoa, this is not good.This is a flaw in the design.And yet you're giving us a roadmap to\nunderstanding and to overcoming it.Paul Conti: Right?Let's say we take your\nexamples and we really look.They're great examples and\nwe look at them, right?The person making fun of\nthe coat in third grade.We're assuming it hasn't harmed you, it\nhasn't changed the course of your life.What does it tell us?It shows that negative\nstimuli are very salient.I'm sure you got a lot of compliments\nin third grade too, right?But it's the negative that stands\nout, which just shows that there's asalience bias in us towards the negative.And that's probably about\nsurvival and threat sensing.Like, in some ways it makes sense\naround human survival, but it doesn'tmake sense around human trauma.So you had given the example of what\ngets communicated to the child when,say, mother says something negative about\nfather when father's out of the room.Father says something negative about\nmother when mother's out of the room.Just to give an example.So, children, because the\ncomplex cognitive mechanismshaven't been formed yet, right?Then the natural way that the brain\nfunctions is in a self referential way.So the child generally doesn't\nhave the capacity to say, like, oh,mom and Dad aren't really getting\nalong well in this certain way.So when Dad's not here, mom vents a little\nbit about something about him by saying.The child isn't thinking\nabout that, right?Then what the child will often\ninternalize is, okay, there'sme and there's mom and dad.And mom says dad is bad,\nand dad says mom is bad.And I must be bad too, right?Because in general, if your\nparents are bad, then thechild takes that on themselves.Now, again, I'm giving a simple example,\nbut I'm very much extrapolating it.I mean, imagine if that were very,\nvery aggressive where the mother,when this happens, just tells\nthe child how awful the fatheris and the father does the same.Someone's not going to come out the other\nside of that being like, you know what?Maybe they're both awful, but I'm not.That's not how that goes.So the lessons, the traumatic lessons\nof childhood get internalized.And they don't even always\nhave a solution state.So you think about the man who knew,\nlike, okay, you have to go get this job.And all those things he internalized.You might say, well, I mean,\nhe got to a good place for him.So for better or for worse, at\nleast there was a place to go.To go work hard, go succeed.Go check this box you've been\ntold you're supposed to check, butoftentimes there is no solution state.So how many children, I mean, it's\nterrible that this is such a highpercentage of the work adult practitioners\ndo is helping people who, as childrenwere told one way or another that\nthey were worthless, incapable, bad.That gets put into the child.Unfortunately, far, far...I mean, one time on the\nplanet is too frequent, letalone how often this happens.Andrew Huberman: That example\nmakes really good sense.And this is a question.Could we add to that the example\nwhereby the child overhears examplesof what say, men should be like or\nwomen should be like these things.It's not so much like, you did wrong\nAndrew or you did wrong Paul, ortelling the daughter you screwed up.But it's more, again, narratives that\nwe overhear, or even a parent showingdelight or excitement about a certain\nphenotype in the world, like, oh, wow,look at that person, or look at them.Isn't she beautiful, right?That the young child thinks like,\nokay, well, then that's the epitome ofbeauty through the lens of the parent.Or, gosh, like this person.Then that child internalizes\nthat this is the epitome ofdisgust with another human being.And I think children are so savvy without\nrealizing it, it's like, okay, well,then I guess you move toward that and you\naspire to that and you deflect from that.And you can see how these\ntrajectories can be set very early on.I mean, these are the four lane\nhighways that we were talking aboutin episode one, where just routes of\nneural processing that can bring usto choices in life and places in life\nthat oftentimes you go like, I don'twant to go down this path anymore.The exploration of early narratives,\nboth direct and indirect, first person"

            "text": "and third person, seem so critical.How does one go about that?I mean, clearly, with a trained\nclinician like you, you wouldguide somebody through the process.But if somebody were to try and\ndo this in some sort of structuredway for themselves, what do\nthose lines of inquiry look like?Because we have vast number of experiences\nfrom childhood, but some messages aregoing to be more salient than others.Paul Conti: Sure.Yeah.The idea that reflective self scrutiny can\nhelp us, I think, is just a great idea.It's a great concept.And we do a lot of different things\nsort of inside, and we're guidedto do a lot of things inside.But this, I think, should overshadow many,\nif not most of all those other thingsof what's really going on inside of me.Because if you think about\nit, a lot of people will comethrough that and they'll learn.So the person is told like, this is what\nbeautiful is, this is what successfulis, this is what good enough looks like.And that person may, through all sorts\nof experiences, maybe other people intheir lives who are more balanced, be\nable to arrive on the other side ofthat even still sometimes going through\nthe midst of it, depending upon ageand situation, and know, like, okay, my\nfather and mother thinks like, this iswhat beauty is, this is what success is.But it's one set of opinions,\nand there's not a set of opinionsthat are going to define me.Sometimes people get to that place,\nbut a lot of times they don't.And they carry that lesson forward\nand they're not aware of it, right?So they think that they're very\nunattractive, even though other peopleare giving them different signals.They think that they're very\ndumb, even though other peopleare giving them different signals.And their own grades and their own success\nmay be giving them different signals.But they're not putting\nthe two things together.And that's going to generate tension.That might be why that person doesn't\nfollow up on potential relationships.They just don't think they're\ngood enough and the person'seventually going to reject them\nbecause of what they look like.They're taking that with them\nin this example from childhood.Or they're not satisfied with the job\nthat in other ways is really great.They enjoy the work.They enjoy everything,\nbut doesn't pay enough.Why?Because they have some false idea\ninside of what it's supposed to pay.Because it's what the parent\nsaid by self scrutiny.What are the givens?I always think it goes\nback to the math minor.If you can't solve the problem,\ngo back and look at the givens.What are you taking for granted?Like, oh, I know that every time\nI see an X, that X equals four.Really?Maybe you wrote down four somehow\nbecause you were thinking of four atthe time and X actually is a three.Right.Just go back and look at what\nyou're taking for granted.And a lot of times this is what we're\ndoing in the therapy process, and thenthat's when the person can realize.So I'm simplifying, but for the\nperson to realize, like, oh, there'sa voice in my head, so to speak.It's a natural voice.That is the voice of this person who\nmay not even be around anymore, whoseopinion doesn't mean to me what it\ndid before, but that voice is saying,you're unattractive, you're not making\nenough money, you're not good enough.And you know what?I don't believe that\nthey can identify that.And then it doesn't happen all at once.But you can get it out of you.Generally, you don't get it out of you\nunless you realize that it's there.Andrew Huberman: What is the\nprocess of getting it out?Because I think that we all have the\ncapacity to remember certain things and toarrive at a place where we can understand.Okay, I'm taking for granted\nthe fact that there's a voicein my head that says blank.Actually, I have a brief anecdote\nto say about this, and thisisn't I have a friend thing.I literally have a female friend\nwho the other day called melaughing and crying because she was\nbeing evicted from her apartment.And she told her mother\nabout this over the phone.And her mother's response was,\nwell, at least you're thin.Paul Conti: Wow.Andrew Huberman: And she was laughing\nand crying about it because it reflectedso much of her childhood that no other\naccomplishment of having a job, havingan apartment, et cetera, mattered.It was about one thing.It was about a certain form of\naesthetic beauty that I'm not evensure she subscribes to, even though\nshe happens to be thin, right?So the fact that her mother would\nlift that from the conversation,there's such a deprivation of so\nmany things in that interaction.But it really wasn't\nabout that interaction.She was calling me because it was really\nabout her entire childhood, right.And obviously, I'm not\nequipped to solve the problem.And it wasn't a request for\nmoney or anything of that sort.It was almost like the hilarity and the\nsadness of the whole picture, right?But again, it speaks to these\nnarratives that we internalizeand that sometimes show up in very\nglaring ways in the real world.It's like to hear that, I\nthink, was shocking to her.I think she needed to\ntell me to, is this real?But then it was clear that\nthat message had existed in herhead for a long time anyway.Paul Conti: That could be very\npivotal if she realizes that, right?And even the power of the humor of\nit is like, this is absurd, right.That can be very powerful in creating\nchange, because if there's some vestigeof that inside of her where she still\nbelieves, like, oh, I'm not good enoughbecause I achieved A, B and C, but I\ndon't look like X or whatever, it canvery much help because there's a lot of\npower behind realizing that absurdityof, like, oh, my, that's bizarre.But wait, is any of that inside of me?Am I carrying some of that with me?I mean, there's an incentive for\nself scrutiny through what you'redescribing, because what's the ideal\namount of that to still be in her?Zero.Andrew Huberman: So as one comes to\nrealize, the messages they've heard,or perhaps, like, in this case,\nthat they're still hearing, is theprocess of overcoming those messages\nand really arriving at the self.It sounds to me like it's a two part\nprocess, at least two part process.It's to look in the bin\nof what are the givens?What am I taking for granted\nabout the internal narratives andthinking about their origins in\nchildhood or elsewhere, but then alsocultivating the self awareness piece\nthat's under the function of self.Like, wait, what's really true\nfor me at the level of me?And this is really, I think, about\nseparating out the voices in one'shead, these internalized narratives from\nthe person that we really truly are.Paul Conti: Because the idea is\nthat those two pillars encompasseverything we need to look at.Those ten cupboards encompass everything.So it's all that.The person who's going and looking\nat the givens, they're trying tounderstand what might be in my\nunconscious mind that I'm not aware of.And, wow.The last time I got this big award\nat work, I had this reflexive thoughtof like, but you're not thin enough.Wow.Whoa.Right?There could be a process, like,\nthat's going on inside of me.I don't want that going on inside of me.So the process of trying what is\nunconscious in us that may be causingus harm, which is often where,\nthat's where the trauma goes, right.It's where the childhood trauma\nseats itself, which brings us backaround to the intrusive thoughts.Intrusive, negative thoughts.A negative self dialogue usually\ndoes not mean what it meant to theman who need to change jobs, right.Because they were there for a good reason.Then he needed to make change more often.The vestiges, the hangover, the\nlingering badness of some prior trauma.So oftentimes when you think, we\ntalked a little bit yesterday aboutthe person who was driving in the\ncar and just telling themselves overand over that they're a loser, right?And then they can't achieve\nthe things that they achievedwhen they stopped doing that.I'm simplifying a little,\nbut that's the basics of it.Because the intrusive thoughts, the\nself narrative, all the negativity inus is often coming from places that\nare in the unconscious mind, right?Not always.But this idea that I don't think\nI'm good enough, I'm saying it tomyself over and over again, like,\nwow, let's go back and look at why.Because the answer to that,\nagain, lies in a different place.There's just a different roadmap, right?The man who needed to change jobs\nhad a roadmap that spent a littlebit of time in the I, self awareness.And then it went through self defense\nmechanisms in action land, and itspent a lot of time with behavior,\nand then it got up to the strivings.That's his roadmap.Whereas for someone who's laboring under\nthe intrusive thoughts, the negative selftalk, the automaticity, the givens of\nchildhood trauma then needs to go to adifferent place where now we're spending\ntime in the unconscious mind thinkingabout what's there, figuring out what's\nthere, bringing things to consciousness.That person, say, realizing\nmaybe your friend, you had thisrealization of, like, oh, my goodness.We say, wow, did that bring something\nto the conscious mind in her.If so, great, let's look at that and\nlet's look a lot at it and let's look.Are there other things there too?Are there other givens?Let's bring them to conscious, to\nconsciousness so that we can talk aboutthem, we can identify them, and then\nlook at how does that relate to defensemechanisms and character structure?And now what are we doing?A process of interested inquiry\nlike this is really interesting.I mean, it should be interesting\nto the person doing it.It's them, right?And it should be interesting to the\nperson doing it with them, right?Because if you're a therapist\nand it's not interesting to you,you need another job, right?Or you're talking to a friend.Like if it's a friend is\ngoing to be interested.So there's an interested, honest,\nopen inquiry with the idea of holiday.\n Let's learn things so that we\ncan make change for the better.And even though, as we talked about\nyesterday, the intrusive thoughts andthe self dialogue that's gone on over\nand over and over again, it doesn't goaway easily, but that doesn't mean it\ndoesn't atrophy over time and go away.Or that the person can have that\nreflexive thought like, oh, there'sthe thought again that I'm a loser\nor that I should cut myself or Ishould drink or whatever it is.I know that thought appears in me\nautomatically at times because itwas in my head for so long, but\nit does not telling me anything,it's just an automatic thought.It's not telling me I should drink,\nit's not telling me anything, right?Other than the fact that, oh,\nthat's what happens in human beings.That's how the self understanding\nbrings change in us and gets usover the barriers of why i've been\ntrying this for what modern mentalhealth would often have us think.I took the Silexan, I did\nthe ten sessions of CBT.I'm a failure.Nothing will ever get better.A different framing that says,\nhey, this can get better over time.And my understanding and my efforts\nand my thought redirection, mybehavioral changes all makes it better.And then those things I don't want\nin my head, they're going away.It's taken time, but they're going away.Andrew Huberman: I'm relieved to hear\nyou say that one can have intrusive"

it's just\na boring story or boring imagery.There's nothing there.There's nothing there.And then they eventually\nbreak up like clouds.That process could take a while because...Paul Conti: You took the energy\nout of them, you made them goaway, which happened over time.And then the energy that was so\npowerful becomes less and less and less.And what happens?They dissipate, they atrophy.That's how they go away,\nbecause there's no more power.There's no more power in them.And that really is the\nway that we make change.And I think your emphasis upon the\nfact that it takes time, the factthat it takes effort, the fact\nthat it only goes away slowly.Over 20 years of, at times, being a\ntherapist, what I've seen the mostdaunting, the thing that makes people\njust give up and go away and go backto the things that hurt bad, give up\non themselves, are that it takes time.And if you think it's supposed to take\ntwo weeks, and the world around youis kind of leading you to think that,\nand then you go for help, and thehelp kind of leads you to think that\nwhether it's two weeks or it's tenweeks, if it's going to take two years,\nyou're going to go away disheartened.Or maybe more angry at\nyourself or maybe demoralized.So we have to look at the truth of\nall of this, parallel to your story.In my own life, for years and years\nand years, I carried a negativevoice inside that was always waiting\nfor me to do something wrong.So if I say something that's a little\nbit off or not exactly what I want to saynow, it would say, like, that wasn't good.It says something negative inside to me,\nor it's waiting for me to drop somethingand say that I'm stupid and clumsy, right.With me all the time.But over time, through self reflection,\nthrough therapy, like, through alot of hard work, but a desire for\nthings to be better and a desire tounderstand it, it's not there anymore.I mean, every now and then,\nit'll raise its head, right?I'll do something.Really?I dropped a cup of coffee.I haven't done it in ten years,\nand it made a mess, and now peopleare coming to clean it up, and,\nman, the voice came back, right?But I could recognize it.I really feel bad about this.And now it gives that voice\na chance to come out, but itdoesn't come out much anymore.Whereas I lived with it for years,\nit doesn't come out much anymore.And when it came out not that\nlong ago, I could recognize it.I'm not happy I did this and\nlet me help clean it up, but itdoesn't mean I'm an idiot, right?So the voice in my head can just\ngo away, as I've been helping itto do for a bunch of years now.Andrew Huberman: Yeah.I think also important for people to\nunderstand is that it takes time, butthat we can all potentially engage in,\nright, actions, moving towards strivingsand hopefulness as we cope with those\nand try and diminish those internalnarratives, those intrusive thoughts.It's not as if during the entire\nprocess, you can't function.I mean, I think that it's cognitively and\nsometimes even physically demanding to do,but we can still engage in healthy ways in\nthe world, and we can still try and avoidacting out and avoid forms of denial.As I say this, I'm realizing that the\nwish for or the impulse to really justsuppress intrusive thought born of\ntrauma or whatever else is really futile.That's not going to work.It's not going to work.We have to embrace these narratives and\nnot expect them to disappear in a fingersnap, but embrace them and see them and\nlook at them and be unafraid to lookat them and discount where they are.Absolutely not true.Paul Conti: I would say\nunafraid to understand, right?Because we must understand means we must\nlook at what's going on inside of us.When I didn't like that voice\nbut was afraid of it, like,what is going on inside of me?What does this say about me?And I'm directing away from it.Well, that's why it was with\nme for, like, several decades.But when I start to go look at\nit, I can find an answer to it.And again, you have to look at what's\ngoing on in that person because onemight presume, and maybe people listening\nare presuming this or maybe not, buta reasonable presumption that might\njust reflexively happen in a personwould be to think that, oh, when I was\nyounger, the messaging I was gettingwas that you're not good enough.Right?You're not good enough.That's why I carry with\nme, you're not good enough.But it's not that sometimes it's the\nopposite, that I was rewarded a lotwhen I was younger for doing things\nin a way everyone thought was great.Like getting great grades and being well\nbehaved, doing all sorts of things thatbrought a lot of positive reinforcement\nto me, but I never handled well thingsthat fell even a little bit short of that.And then it would evoke a lot of shame.So the oppression inside is not\ncoming from denigration, it'scoming from something different.Which is also why this is not\na search to blame someone.Because sometimes the people\nwho are giving the message,they're doing the best they can.I mean, someone who's saying to a child,\nyou're a loser, like, that's not okay.No matter what, that's not okay.But that's often not how it happens.The parent, like you says, communicating,\nthey don't realize that every timethey're admiring a certain level of\nwealth or a certain kind of beauty,they're giving that message that the\nchild that doesn't meet that or endsup not meeting that isn't good enough.But they don't know that.Or my parents tried to nurture me\nand they did a good job of it in manyways, and teachers did a good job.So they're not realizing, hey,\nthis person's going to end upa bunch of years from now not\nthinking anything's good enough.They don't know that.So it's not a search for blame.And I think that's very, very important.Very important.Because often people don't want to look\ninside because they think either I'mgoing to find something dramatically\nwrong with me, and the answer I wouldgive is there's almost surely not\nsomething dramatically wrong withyou if you're having that thought.And if somehow there is, you're better\noff looking at it now than later.So that's part of it.The other part is that people\nbecome worried that they'regoing to ruin something.I like my parents and if I go look\nat this, I'm going to hate them.People say things or\nthink things like that.And the idea that we may get down\nto something that really involvessomeone being responsible for something\nbad, now, if that's the truth, theperson already knows that inside.The vast majority of times, they know\nthat they're just not facing that.But most of the time also, it's not that.It's just like, okay,\nthat's how life evolved.And what's the predisposition?Like, I was smart enough to get good\ngrades, and I have a low thresholdfor shame, and people reinforced me\nand like, oh, I can kind of understandthat, so then I can get control over it.It's not a search for anger,\nfrustration, blame of self or others.Andrew Huberman: Yeah."

            "text": "Oftentimes I hear that people are afraid\nof dealing with these deeper issues oraddressing these deeper issues for fear\nthat they'll lose, say, their drive.Right.The thing that makes them\nsuccessful in the first place.And that allows them perhaps even to\nafford therapy or afford the time tothink about these sorts of questions.So it seems to me that the drives that you\nreferred to earlier, the generative drive,the aggressive drive, and the pleasure\ndrive, are such critical nodes or areasto look for all of us in terms of figuring\nout whether or not we're doing well orless well according to some features\nthat are pretty much universal in people.Essentially what I'm saying is, at\nleast by my understanding, we allhave drives to some extent or another.And to the extent that our aggressive\ndrive is very high and pleasuredrive is very high, and whether\nor not it's pointed in the rightdirection, it can be generative.If it's not, perhaps it can\nundermine our generative drive.I'm very curious to know how you've\nobserved the different ranges ofthese drives in people and how that\npredicts whether or not people willdo more or less well in different\nareas of life, essentially howthe different drives play out.Paul Conti: I think that the first\nthing to say is where the drives areat, so to speak, in any of us is a\ncombination of nature and nurture.So the nature part tells us the range,\nsort of that the drive is going to be.But because nurture means so much\nto humans, as we understand fromepigenetics, from the advancement\nof science, we see more and moreand more how much nurture matters.So the range that's denoted by\nnature is probably pretty broad.We see the manifestation of that, and then\nthe nurture lets us then move that drive.Now, sometimes nurture, that's not\ngone in the right place can movethe drive in the wrong direction.But as adults, as people who can\ntake care of ourselves, who canlearn about ourselves, we can\nchange where the drives are seated.It's not an easy thing to do because\nit requires a lot of changes ofself knowledge and hard work.But we can do it.We can change the sort of\narray of how those drives aremanifesting themselves within us.And we see that, I mean, that's\npart of the hopefulness ofmental health treatment, right?That we see not just surface changes,\nbut we can see changes on a deeper level.So I think it's important that\nthese things are not fixed.Although there are some natural elements.Someone who may have a natural sort of\nlow aggression or low self assertion,okay, it's going to be in the lower\nrange, but it doesn't mean that it'slocked in at any one particular point.And that the place that we want to be,\nwhat is the place that's consistentwith the things that we want, the\nagency and gratitude as verbs, and thesense of well being and all of that.So the idea is the state of health\nhas the generative drive as prominent.It's the dominant drive, and then\naggression and pleasure, which arestill active in us, but they're\nsubserving the generative drive, andthat's the state that we wish to be in.So when we're assessing, okay, why is\nthere something that doesn't feel okayor something that's not going okay, then?One way to start is to look at,\nokay, what's going on in the person,what may be off in the drives.That gives us a very strong\nidea of, okay, what's going on.A way of understanding what's going on as\nwe then go and look in the ten cupboardsto figure out the specifics, okay, what\nis actually going on here that we can thenchange, but the framing of what's going\non can come through the lens of looking atthe drives and how they're manifest in us.Andrew Huberman: What does it look like\nwhen the aggressive drive is very highand the pleasure drive is also very high?Paul Conti: So if these drives are\nrunning too high, where we end upat is in a place of envy and envy.I'm always sort of on the soapbox\nabout envy, because I think envyis just so wildly destructive.And if the aggressive drive is\nvery high, so the person say, inone way this can manifest itself,\njust wants more and more and more.They're not getting satisfaction\nfrom anything, but they want more.That may be because of a strong\nvulnerability inside of them.So something that might map\nto narcissism, for example.There could be a strong aggressive\ndrive to get more, and that leadsto something that's very unhealthy.So the idea that I want more, I need more,\nI don't have enough, I can't get enough,then fosters envy, which is not the desire\nto be better or to have more, but it'sjust the desire to feel better about the\nself, whether that involves raising theself up or bringing someone else down.That's why envy is destructive.So very high levels of aggression that\nare not tempered, for example, by agenerative drive that would also be\nhigh, then create a circumstance ofenvy, and the envy is destructive.And the same happens if the\npleasure drive is very, very strong.So if one continues to want more pleasure.So I can't find any satisfaction.I don't feel good about myself.I feel bereft inside.And I see that pleasure can make me\nfeel better, but just for a little bit.Then it fades away and I want\nmore of it, and I want more of it.That also can lead to the place of envy.Like that's the outcome.So if the aggressive drive is running\nvery high, or the pleasure drive isrunning very high, or if both are running\nvery high, but it only takes one inorder to end up in a place of envy.So if the generative drive is not high\nenough to overcome how high the aggressivedrive is, which would mean then the\naggressive drive would be sublimatedtowards good, productive things.So take the energy and put it\ntowards something that is goodness.But if the aggressive drive was way\nout there ahead of the generativedrive, that ends up in a place of\nenvy, as does the pleasure drive.If I want more and more and more,\nbut I never get satisfaction fromanything, it never brings me any sense\nof goodness that where it ends is in aplace of vulnerability and resentment.Because envy involves wanting more.If we look at what's really\ngoing on, envy under the surfaceinvolves wanting everything, right?If a person is at the outer limits of\nenvy, which is why envy is so destructive.Because if I can't get enough pleasure\nand there's so much aggression in me, thenI'm not going to make myself feel better.But what I can do is make\nother people feel worse.Andrew Huberman: I want to\nask you more about envy.But first I want to ask is one way to\ncharacterize the generative drive and"

            "text": "to distinguish it from the other drives\nis to say that generative drives are prosocial, meaning they tend to bring about\nbenevolent interactions between people in.Paul Conti: The sense that pro\nsocial as constructive, right?In a sense, building goodness, then yes,\nbecause it's the drive in us that makesus want to love and nurture things.That makes us want to learn and\nsometimes learn to make better in theworld or learn for learning's sake.The drive is a drive of goodness.So if the drive is then going to\nenact itself in the world aroundus, it's going to be pro social,\nbecause we exist as social units.Imean, if we decide, oh, I want\nto be an island off somewhere,that's not healthy, right?We exist in social units from small, like\na nuclear family to a neighborhood, allthe way up to nations and to the planet.So if we perceive the truth of that,\nthat, hey, there's an interdependencebetween me and others, and I see that\nthen the drive will lead to choices andbehaviors that are socially constructive.Andrew Huberman: Earlier, you talked\nabout aggression, and you were clearto make sure that we all understood\nthat aggression does not necessarilymean violent aggression, that there\nare different forms of aggression.I'm curious if you could give us\nsome examples of how you've observedpeople with high levels of aggression\nand high levels of pleasure drive aswell, both male and female, and here,\nwithout defaulting to stereotypes.I think a lot of people just despite\nthe fact that you've clarifiedwhat aggression is and isn't in\nthe context of this conversation,we hear the word aggression and we\nthink verbal attack, physical attack.However, the way you're describing\naggression and the aggressive drive, Ihave a feeling that you're referring to\nother expressions of aggression as well.Paul Conti: So if the aggressive drive\nis running too high, and that could havefactors of nature, factors of nurture,\nfactors of the situation the person isin, factors of their whole life, but it\nends up at the moment in a place thatis too high, then what that person is\ndoing in one way or another is to tryand exert an unhealthy level of control.And that can be done in\nso many different ways.It can be done in that overt\nway of just intimidating people.Of using harsh language towards people.It can be done by manipulating people.It can be done through passive aggression.There are all sorts of ways that the\nperson can try and exert unhealthycontrol, but that's where we end up.If there's too much expression\nof the aggressive drive in us,Andrew Huberman: That makes sense.And it reminds me of an example from\nmy own life, where, first off, Ishould say I've had almost exclusively\npositive collaborations among mycolleagues at Stanford and elsewhere.Every one of those collaborations\nhas ended in a paper thatwe were all happy with.But more importantly, the relationships\ngrew and were not diminished.But I had one collaboration with\nsomeone, not to be named, where itwas going very well, but I had the\nneed to reschedule an appointment.So I sent ahead a note about the\nfact that my car dealing with.I had some other things.I explained why I need to reschedule the\nappointment and didn't receive a reply,which was a little unusual, but then\neventually received a reply that said,well, it's clear that you don't want to\npursue this collaboration, which is likethe furthest thing from the truth, right?And so I expressed that, and then\nthe collaboration was reinstated.But it brought to mind some concern for\nme because it was sort of an extremereaction to something that happens among\nacademics or anyone we get busy with.Things come up.It was important to tend\nto the car, that is.And then at some point later, they\nwere late to a number of meetings.Okay, no big deal.We're academics, we tend to run late.That's typical of many academics.But then I was late once to a meeting,\nand they essentially left and wrotean email that said something of the\nsort, like, I've got my own greatideas, so I'm no longer interested\nin pursuing the collaboration.And I was pretty shocked, because there\nwas nothing really outside the ordinaryin terms of busyness and prefaceorial\nschedules, and there were other peopleinvolved, postdocs and things like that.And there was a great\nproject to be worked out.So I remember being disappointed,\nbut also really kind of surprised.But then when I mapped it back to the\nearlier example of the car incident,I thought, well, there's a real sort\nof lack of ability of this person tohandle disappointment, and yet they're\nexerting or demonstrating rather someof the same behavior, of occasionally\nrunning tardy and these kinds of things.And I remember feeling like\nit was pretty aggressive.It's a pretty aggressive reaction\nto something that could havebeen handled with a conversation.Now, I must say I'm very grateful that\nthe collaboration didn't proceed and itwent elsewhere and it worked out great,\nand they're doing great and we're doinggreat, and so, no hard feelings, but\nit stands out to me as a pretty salientexample of aggression, but not played\nout at the level of yelling or anything.There's a passivity in there,\nbut then there's also kindof a kind of entitlement.And here, of course, I'm only looking\nat the other person's behavior.And I should acknowledge, I\nrealize canceling, not good.Being late, not good.But listen, I'm a human being, and I...Paul Conti: You canceled once.You were late once.This isn't habitual.This is human stuff.Right?Andrew Huberman: Right.And a lot of good work had gone\ninto the project, and there was acost where, most importantly, the\npostdoc suffered because they weren'tinvolved in these interactions at all.And yet the project halted at that point.So to me, that seems like an\nexample of somebody who has a,well, strong, aggressive drive.And that's clear from that\nthey are incredibly successfulin the academic domain.And when disappointed, lashes back\nor is passive, one or the other.Is that what we're getting at here?Not surprisingly, perhaps, the person\nrarely publishes with other people.Paul Conti: Right.Andrew Huberman: Probably that doesn't\nmake a very good collaborative partner.Paul Conti: Right.And it totally makes sense.Think about what you're describing here,\nwhich is some vulnerability in the person.There's some way in which the person\ndoesn't feel good enough, no matterwhat this person has achieved.So then there's a sense of the\nneed and the right to over control.So when you agree to work together,\nyou didn't agree that I'llnever have to cancel anything.Right?Sure.But the thought was different, the\nframing is different on the other end,that now we're going to work together.So I'm exerting significant\ncontrol over you.And again, you're not aware of it.And maybe that he's not aware of it.Andrew Huberman: In\nthis case, it was a she.Paul Conti: Okay, so I was thinking of\nsomeone different, but she has to havesome deficit of self that results then\nin the reflexive need to over control.And think about the first\nresponse is a non response.Which is, that's aggression.But it's just passive aggression.The thought would be, well, you're\nworried something doesn't feel good in youbecause I didn't respond, which was true..You're expecting a response,\nmaybe you don't know.Did you get the email?What's happening?Is she mad?So it's sort of effective.It creates some consternation\nand some dissonance in you.Then on top of that, the person\nis willing to potentially, at thatpoint, sacrifice the relationship.So you think about\naggression now is not good.This excess aggression\nis not good for you.It also is clearly eclipsing\nthe generative drive.Because it's not good for this\nperson and their research.It's not good for this person\nand the postdocs in their lab.But the person is willing to\naccept that in the service ofgratifying the excess in aggression.Now, so then you said something\nthat then sort of made it okay.For the short term.Okay.Then the person feels gratified, like,\nwhether you apologize or not, theytook it as you've, to some degree,\nbowed down before me now, like, it'llbe okay, at least for the short term.But then the next thing that happens\nactually does end the collaboration.So that's not good.And you say, even from a self\nserving perspective, that person wascollaborating with you for a reason.She saw a benefit to the science\nthat she's very, very interested inthrough the collaboration with you.But then let that all go\nin the service of what?In the service of the ego.Of, I don't feel good enough about myself.The response to that then,\nis a response of envy.That I don't like that you\nhave the freedom to behavedifferently than I want you to.I don't like any of it.I don't like that I don't control\nyou as much as I would like to.And ultimately, it's that\nenvy that becomes destructive.So it's a setback for that person.It's destructive of the\nscience that person was doing.It's destructive of the\nscience that you were doing.So envy is destructive.And here, the high level of\naggression, the aggressivedrive, is at a very high place.It's exceeding the generative drive.The pleasure drive isn't high enough\neither, because there's not enoughpleasure coming from the great\nscience that's being done, right?So then the person is approaching the\nworld through the lens of envy, right?They don't feel good enough.They want to exert that\naggression through over control.And what they end up doing\nis destructive, right?And it's very clearly destructive.It's a great example because\nit's destructive of the science,which is ostensibly the reason\nthat you're there, right?It's the reason you were there.But someone who needs to\nexert over control is there,not just for that reason.And then the other reasons can trump the\ngenerative reason that they're there.And that's how envy, when it is the\nproduct of aggression or pleasureseeking, being too high, always\nunfailingly creates destruction.And how different is that from\nagency and gratitude as active verbs.There's a sense of agency, but the agency\nisn't being exactly enacted, because ifthe agency is being enacted in the service\nof science or career or whatever it maybe, that's not going so well, right.And the gratitude part isn't active.Like, my goodness, I'm here,\nI have this great career.I'm discovering things.I get to spend my life in science.I get to collaborate with you.There's so many things to feel good about.I have postdocs in my lab, right?I get to nurture them because\nI know more and I can guide.That's not leading.Envy is not those things, which is why\npeople who are doing that, at least inthis realm of life, although this often\nthis bleeds into other realms of life,the vast majority of times you see, is\nsomeone who does not have happiness inthe way that happiness with the quotes.That happiness is the sense of peace,\nthe sense of well being, right?Being able to delight\nin things, contentment.The person doesn't have that.And here it's interesting, right?This person gets to the highest\nlevels of academia, and they're verysuccessful, and they have a lab of\ntheir own, and they're collaborating.You think that's all great, right?But not inside of them.It's not bringing them those things, as\nevidenced by how this person is behaving.And I would bet almost 100% if you say,\nwhat's that person like in other aspectsof life, at least in the professional\nrealm, probably in others, too.No one's going to describe a happy person.Andrew Huberman: So much of\nwhat you just said captures"

            "text": "this individual extremely well.And it also reminds me that so much\nof the way that you're describing thisaggressive drive can also be observed,\nperhaps in the way that people show upto social interactions, not necessarily\nbig interactions, maybe even justinteractions between two people.What I'm thinking of here is the\nperson, male or female, who shows upand just kind of takes over, talks\nthe whole time and tells stories.I went to a meal when I graduated\nuniversity, and someone showed upfor the first time at this meal,\nmeaning we had never met them before,and just sat down and just started\ntelling stories for like an hour.And it was interesting.Portions of it were captivating.And then at some point I realized\nthis is either total pathology.Like, this person is crazy, but they\nweren't crazy, or they have no recognitionthat they're absorbing all the oxygen in\nthe room, as it's sometimes described.But it seemed like they had this need to\njust control the whole environment by wayof speech, just like fire hose stories.And I've seen this definitely\nin the academic realm.I've seen this in the non academic\nrealm, in social settings.What's interesting is perhaps why this\nperson does this or these people do this.But what's also interesting\nis how people react to it.On the one hand, I think most people find\nthat kind of obnoxious, but there alsoseem to be people who see this as like,\noh, that person has a lot of agency.Like they're a leader.They actually grab a lot of the\nattention that they're seeking.And we tend to view those\npeople as kind of empowered.I don't actually think that they're\nnecessarily empowered, but perhaps itstems from the feeling that the rest\nof us, I like to think, have, whichis some sense of social etiquette,\nwhere there's some give and take.You walk into a room, you kind of\nassess what's the context here.There's some listening as well\nas some speaking and so on.When someone shows up and kind of violates\nall those rules, on the one hand, it canbe obnoxious and overtake everything.But as it said before, there's also the\nsense of like, oh, that must be niceto just be able to be as one feels.And so I'm describing this not because\nI think people should mimic this typeof behavior either way, be really\nmeek and not say anything that'son their mind or just overtake, but\nbecause I feel like it might be anexploration of this aggressive drive.And if someone's doing that, are\nthey trying to mask something else?And why do people react to these\nseemingly powerful people in this way?Paul Conti: These things happen\nin the world around us, right?They're independent of the\nspectrum of gender, the spectrumof intelligence, achievement.They're human problems.So a person you're describing,\nwhether that person has characterstructure, problems that are present\nwith them across time, or whetherthey're in a certain place, whether\nit's in life or today, we don't knowfor sure what the underpinnings.But what you're describing is\nit's a presentation of narcissism.And narcissism is rooted not in\nconfidence, not in arrogance.It's rooted in vulnerability.It's rooted in I don't feel good enough.And narcissism then engages with\nthe world through the lens of envy.So no one else gets to have any time.No one else gets to say anything funny.No one else maybe gets\nto say anything at all.There's a dominance of the room, right?There's a dominance of the room\nthat comes through an inability totolerate the back and forth of human\ninteractions, human engagement.So then that person becomes very dominant.And why is that?Because when they tell a story and they\nget a laugh or even if it's not that funnyand it's a 15 minute story, but somebody\nsmiles a little bit or nobody smiles.They can perceive inside that.Like, I just did that, I said that.And maybe somebody responded positively.I feel good about that for a split second.Now that's gone.And then the next thing comes, and\nthe next thing comes, because peoplewho are coming at the world through\nthe lens of narcissism, whether it'sjust in that particular event or it's\nacross life, are never satisfied.And nothing ever brings enough\ngoodness, nothing ever bringsenough feeling of pleasure.So the person then wants more, and\nthat's how the person dominates the room.Now that can be very seductive.Narcissistic people, not always, but\nare often very seductive because ofthat appearance of mastery, of control.So that person did have, we could\nlook at it in the short term and saythat person had mastery over the room.No one said anything for an hour but them.So they had mastery over the room.They had control over the room.But what they're doing\nis exerting over control.It's like Pennywise and\nPound Foolish, right?That borrow a dollar today\nto pay back 100 tomorrow.Because they got to control that room.But a lot of people, not everyone,\nsome people are seduced by it.But a lot of people will take away\nfrom that something that's not a goodfeeling, something that wasn't mutual,\nthat doesn't make a person want tocollaborate with that person, even\nbe in the same space as that person.So it's counterproductive\nbecause the people who might comeunder the spell, so to speak.They're the people who were\nbrought under the spell, right.They're less observant, dynamic,\nintuitive, introspective.They're not the people that you\nwant, in a sense, on your side.The people that would be most valuable\nto collaborate with, even as thoughtpartners have conversations with\nthose people are going to be put offbecause even if they don't know exactly\nwhat's wrong, they know, like, thatdidn't feel good and they map, do I\nwant that feeling more in my life?No.So that's the counterproductive aspects.That's why narcissism is destructive,\nbecause you might say, well,there's nothing destructive in that\ninteraction, but again, you have tobe standing so up close to it that\nyou don't see the bigger picture.Because when you stand back from that,\nthat's not a person who's, by andlarge, you see that's not a person\nwho's interconnected in the world aroundthem, has a group of good, supportive\nfriends, has a bunch of colleagues wherethey can sort of exchange information,\nbecause all that social dynamichas to happen in the rest of life.So you're seeing a situation that is\ncounterproductive, that is destructive.And you always see that when people are\nenacting narcissism, whether it's okay,a bunch of bad things have happened,\nand for whatever reason, like, I'm in anunhealthy place and I'm enacting it right\nnow, or if I'm enacting it every day ofmy life, because it's in my character\nstructure and I haven't recognized andchanged it, it's always destructive.Andrew Huberman: The narcissists that\nI've known and observed almost always"

role.In fact, there's one scientist who I did\nnot work with who comes to mind, and thejoke about him was always that this person\nwould talk about themselves endlesslyfor the first half hour that you run into\nthem and say, okay, well, enough about me.Why don't you tell me about me?This person, moved to a different country\nwith their partner, comes back everyonce in a while, has essentially done\nnothing over the last decade or so,kind of left the field, and it's kind of\nsecretly the laughingstock of the field.There was one other\nanecdote about this person.I'm not picking on them.I'm just trying to explore these\ndimensions of aggression andlow pleasure drive and envy.At lab meetings, it was well known\nthat they would host a basketball game,but it was well known that you did not\nwant to score on this person becauseyou would be asked to leave the lab.And Indeed, several people were\nasked to leave the laboratoryfor having embarrassed the lab\nhead at one of these lab events.Paul Conti: By participating in\nexactly the event that was describedin the way it was described and\ndoing something competent, right?Andrew Huberman: So the game was\nessentially a way for the person tobuild themselves up, and they were a\nmediocre, at best, basketball player.So here's this game where everyone's\nexpected to pretend, right?And I have to pretend that the\nperson is actually better atwhat they do than they are.And in some ways, it feels like\na replica of how narcissism showsup in so many other areas of life.Like you said, these people are rarely\nsurrounded by people who are actuallyvery bright, self effacing, et cetera.They tend to gather people that\njust support them or no one at all.Because no reasonably healthy person\nwould choose to be around that.Paul Conti: Because that game is a\nmetaphor for all of life for that person.It's sending that message, like,\nsee this message and extrapolateit out to everything else.What's the metaphor?What's it communicating?It's communicating that you don't\ndo anything better than I do.You don't rise above me\ninterestingly, right?You don't arise above me in any way.You don't get to know things I don't know.You don't get to do anything better than\nI do or I will be destructive towards you.It's fascinating because\nit's not about the game.The game is a way of\ncommunicating that message.Interesting.The person's not even\nthat good at the game.Like why not choose something\nyou're really good at.Because then the message is\nnot communicated as clearly.And a lot of this is unconscious.Let's choose something I'm kind\nof fair to middling at, right?And then make it very clear that\nno one gets to be better or I dosomething destructive to them.That's exactly what that is.And imagine someone is\nthrown out of the lab.I mean, this is in many ways\nthe biggest thing in their lifeor one of the biggest things.Andrew Huberman: Antigenerative.I mean, the cost of that in the\nlarger world is one less potentiallyfantastic scientist, right?Paul Conti: And that's always the broader\npicture because the narcissist is standingvery, very close to the tapestry, right?So the interaction there is you have\nsquared a basket when I have not.So you don't understand the message\nthat you're not supposed to exceed me.And now I will get rid of you because\nyou're dangerous to have around.Because you don't get the message\nand you may exceed me in other ways.And also I'm going to feel better\nbecause I have the power to be punitive,even though it's wantonly punitive.And completely unjustified.But I have the power to do that and it'll\nmake me feel good than to push you away.And I know that's not going to be good\nfor you and I'll feel good about that.But that doesn't last, of course.That's why the person continues to do it.And it also doesn't understand at all\nthat that's not good for science or mostimportantly, that's not good for me.There's a graduate student in that\nlab because you didn't say fire thegraduate student, make the graduate\nstudent leave if the person wasn't good.No, it's make the graduate\nstudent leave no matter what.So the person is doing things that are\ninjurious to the society around us,obviously to the specific person they're\ntargeting, and also to themselves.And that's where, if you follow\nenvy and you see high levels of itin situations that are unbounded.It's like this situation is unbounded in\nthe sense that the person can do that.There's no higher authority.Andrew Huberman: This is changing.And by the way, I should back up a second\nand say that I do believe, and it'sbeen my experience, that most scientists\nand lab heads are not narcissists,are quite kind, are benevolent.I mean, they'd be a little quirky.We're scientists, after all, but\nnot narcissists at the same time.It is true that for a long time,\nless so now, laboratories weresort of like little fiefdoms.There was very little oversight\nfrom the universities.And so the lab you joined became\nyour entire world and landscape.And there was some exploitation by\nnarcissistic lab heads for sure.As you said, it was unbounded, right?Like there was no oversight.Whereas this would be much harder to\nrecreate today if someone wanted to.Paul Conti: And I think that's why\nby almost everyone listening tothis, it will resonate with them.They'll find some familiarity,\nbecause you see this, or youcan see this in situations where\nthere's a bounded group of people.There's just a certain group of\npeople in a certain situation,and that's who they are.But the authority of the person\nleading the group is unbounded.So there's a situation where if that\nperson has narcissistic tendencies,aggressive drive is too high, pleasure\ndrive is high, but not being met.If all of those things are happening,\nthat's when you see this come to light.Which is why the destruction varies\nbased upon the destruction that'spermissible within the framework.So here that this person wasn't\ngoing to fire everyone in their lab.So in a sense, they could\nonly damage their lab so much.Although maybe if you damage your\nlab so much, you don't get funding,you inadvertently sink yourself.So even there, that person could\nbring about their own destruction.But when you see the other end,\nwhere it's truly unbounded inthe sense of war, someone who can\ncontrol a machine of war, who thenhas everything, what do they need?Well, they need something they\ndon't have and never will get.So now they start enacting war,\nand war is destructive, right?And you think, oh, that\nperson wants something.How many times does someone start a war?There's clearly an unjustified war, right?It's a war because they want\nsomething, then they getsomething and they're satisfied.That's not how it goes, right?Then they get something and they're\nnot satisfied, and they want more.So in discussions at times about\nnarcissism and envy and how thatcan play out on the world stage.So sometimes huge events in human\nhistory will come up and people, forexample, will bring up Adolf Hitler\nand the idea that Hitler wanted things.Wanted things.No, the unbound narcissism, the\nunbound envy wanted destruction.This is a person who, if things\nhad continued to go as this personintended, there would have been no\none left on earth but him, because theprocess is nothing but destructive,\nwhich is why, after the fact, there'sincalculable human carnage, right?And he himself was among the\nincalculable human carnage, becausethat's the endpoint of narcissism.Of narcissism on a broad stage.That's the endpoint of envy\nat its highest magnitude.And we see that as examples.Whether we see on the smaller stage of\nthe lab head that you're describing oron the larger stage of unbounded war, we\nend up with destruction, like 100% time.That's the final common\npathway for all of that.Andrew Huberman: Are there some\nconsistent themes of childhood that"

            "text": "For instance, we talked about the former\npatient of yours who eventually switchedjobs, clearly had a generative drive\nwithin him, but it was being blocked bya number of choices rooted in narratives\nthat originated in childhood, et cetera.We talked about individuals with\nhigh aggressive drive, high degree ofpleasure drive, but a very diminished\ncapacity to experience pleasureand therefore a lot of envy and the\ndestruction that comes with envy.Paul Conti: Yes.Andrew Huberman: What are some of the\nother variations on these drives as youobserve them in your clinical practice?Paul Conti: Well, our overall framing\nis we want the generative drive to bethe one that's deterministic . It's\nthe one with the strongest influence.So we want to nurture the generative\ndrive in us and in others, and itmakes sense for us to talk about that.But we've looked at how do\nthings get out of balance.And from the perspective of,\nwell, what if the aggressivedrive or the pleasure drive.What if they're too high?Right?And then it makes sense that often, not\nalways, what can be driving them to be sohigh are things that aren't healthy in us.Then the higher they get, the\nharder it is to gratify them.So we end up with that problem of envy.But we can be out of balance in the\nother direction too, where the persondoes not experience an ability to\nengage with the world around them.They don't think they can do anything\nto change anything for the better,inside or outside of themselves.And they're not doing much.They don't feel that they can do much and\nalso not receiving pleasure from things.There's no gratification from\nthe things a person is doing.Like, we see situations like this\ntoo, with the aggressive drive,the pleasure drive, or both.And then we end up not at envy, because\nenvy is the side of excess, but we endup at demoralization on the lower side.Now, demoralization is not a\nspecific psychiatric diagnosis.It can predispose to psychiatric\nproblems like the biochemicalabnormality of depression.But what we're talking about here is\nnot a psychiatric diagnosis, right?Like envy is not a psychiatric diagnosis.It's a thing that can be experienced,\nthat can lead to diagnoses.The same thing with demoralization.If you don't feel that you can make\na difference to anything and you'renot enjoying anything or feeling\ngratification from anything, thenthat pool is going to win out.That's going to be a demoralized person.The same way, of course, we know in\nexperiments, when you have a rat goingfor food, if you do it enough, when\nthe rat goes for the food and you takethe food away, the rat stops trying.Andrew Huberman: And they\nlearned helplessness, right?Paul Conti: That exists in us too.And it comes along with\nall sorts of other things.Because being not rats, we have\na whole bunch of thoughts aboutthat, of, oh my God, I'm not good\nenough and nothing will ever be.Okay.So demoralization then can be very strong\nin taking a person away from the otherthings we're trying to seek, either\nbecause that person has essentially thelearned helplessness and all the things,\nthe complicated things inside of us thatcan come along with that, or the person\nisn't gaining pleasure from anything.So when we're considering the ways\nin which we can be out of balance, wethink, okay, aggression and pleasure\ndrive, if one or the other or bothis too high, we end up at envy.And if one or the other or both are\ntoo low, we end up with demoralization.And you can take almost any scenario.It could be a scenario of\nsomething that's just not reallynot going well for a person.It's not a clinical scenario,\nit's a thing in a person's life.Or we can take clinical scenarios\nand the vast majority outside ofoutliers, like a head injury, for\nexample, we can take those scenariosand we can look at it in that way,\nand we can understand what's going on.At least we can understand enough\nthat when we go back and look in theten cupboards of the two pillars,\nwe can then have some understandingof, okay, what is going on.We know the basic picture and how things\nare not in the balance we want them innow, we can understand that enough to go\nback and then look in those ten cupboards.And I believe that just about everything\nexcept those biological outliers,like a head injury, fits into that\nheuristic, which is why we can use itto understand, we can use it to help.We can use it to make change.Andrew Huberman: What a powerful lens\nto think about and explore the self and"

and their\nlevel of pleasure drive and theirability to experience pleasure, what\nsorts of questions would one ask?For instance, is it a\nquestion of how driven am I?How much get up and go do I have?How much pleasure do I experience\nfrom an interaction with apuppy, an interaction with food?Is it too much?Does it draw me off course?Are those the sorts of very\nsimple, but perhaps also veryinformative questions that we could\nstart to use to probe our psyche?Paul Conti: Yeah, I think yes,\nbut I would come top down.So if the goal of health is that\naggression and pleasure, thosedrives are subserving the generative\ndrive, then start to look there.If a person can take an honest inventory\nof self, like, what kind of forceam I being in the world around me?And that could mean, for example, what\nkind of force am I being in my family?Am I denigrating to the people around me?Are the other people in\nthe home afraid of me?What kind of force am I\nbeing a force for good?Am I bolstering?People can't always see that in\nthemselves and take stock of themselves.But what we're talking about is\nsituation where we think a personcan like they can bring to bear.Who am I being in the world in other ways?Think of the example of the person\nwho needed to leave the job.Who could look at that and say,\nno, I'm not being generative inthe world in the way I want to.I'm certainly not doing my job\nas well as I would want to.I'm making my own life worse.So that person could then see that's out\nof balance or in another way, a personmight see a lot of what I'm doing is sort\nof self serving or maybe destructive.People can realize that, right?So you can realize by taking an\ninventory of self, is the generativedrive what's deterministic in me?And again, not always, but we're\ntalking about a process of exploration.If the answer to that is yes, if you\nsay, I'm trying to be the best personthat I can, and I think about the\npeople over whom I have any authority.And I try to be reasonable, and I try to\nbe fair, and I try and be circumspect, andI try and think in someone else's shoes.Sometimes I have to set boundaries or\nexpectations or even punishment, right?But I'm careful about how I'm doing that.And I'm certainly not perfect, and I\nget things wrong at times, but I dothink I'm contributing to the world.I'm doing whatever I take\non as well as I can do it.I'm productive at work.My kids are doing okay or my\nfriends are doing all right.Whatever it is that if we can come\nup with that, then we can say,okay, exhale a little bit, like\nyou're in a good place, right.It doesn't mean everything\nis optimal, of course.So then go look at the level\nof the aggressive drive, whichmight mean how assertive am I?Right?Am I the kind of person who\ncomes up to the precipice butdoesn't make the decision?Am I the kind of person\nwho's a little too assertive?And sometimes I'm sort of\nwalking on people a little bit.Like a person can go look at\nthe aggressive drive withinthem or pleasure seeking.Am I doing things that\nbring me gratification?Am I engaging with the people around me\nin a way that brings the gratificationthat one might wish for, right?So if it's in a romantic\nrelationship, is there romance?Like, are we being nice to one another?So you can go and look at that and\nsay, am I getting gratificationfrom the things I'm doing?Am I taking wherever this drive\nis within me and trying to satisfyit in reasonable, healthy ways\nthat are also good for others?And we're back to the generative drive.So that's one way of coming at it, and\nit's the way that we would like to,because now what are we trying to do next?And what can we make things better?Can we optimize things?Okay, things are okay, but\ncan we make them better?But let's say we see that the generative\ndrive is not winning the day, right?And people can see that.Look, I'm seeking pleasure, right?It's why I got, for example, I\nhear over and over, that's why Igot addicted to this substance.It now is not providing any pleasure\nto me and is now making me miserable.But I wanted what it was giving me.Again, this doesn't mean that the person\njust wants to have the world's best time.Right?It may mean that they're\nreally suffering a lot.And the pleasure that that drug\ngave them was some relief from pain.This is how many, many people\ntragically ended up becoming addictedto and dying from opiates, right?Because, say, the opiate after the\nsurgery or the opiate after theinjury, then is soothing something.And it's soothing something\nbecause that person feels less badabout something inside of them.You hear this all the time.That.That then fosters addiction.So that person looking for pleasure,\nthis isn't something where we wouldsay in some light hearted manner, that\nperson took chances with their life.I mean, sometimes we'll see that.But more and more, what people are looking\nfor then is relief from suffering, right?But we can get to that point where we\ncan ascertain, for whatever reason,that the pleasure seeking is too much.And if pleasure seeking and\naggression are too much, webecome aware of dissatisfaction.If you're relying too much on\naggression, I always want my way.It's not always going to happen.Or I always want that pleasurable thing.I always want to feel better.That also doesn't happen.Right?So then that can guide us towards\nbeing aware of where are those drives?And if the drives are high, how\nmuch dissonance is created bywhat's actually coming of the drive\nversus the level the drive is at.I guess it's a long way of saying yes to\nyour question, but I would sort of cometop down because the generative drive is\nso important and it does gate forward.Like, kind of, where are we at in\nthe spectrum of how healthy am I?Or are there elements of unhealth I want\nto kind of go after, or am I seeing thingsin myself that really say things that\nare unhealthy are really dominating mylife are deterministic, like addiction.Just one example.Addiction.Things that are self destructive.Because then that's a place to then look\nat it more through the clinical lens.And maybe I won't just talk to a\ntrusted other and go get a book, butmaybe I should have clinical care.Andrew Huberman: Yeah the example of\naddiction is very potent, and it also"

again,\nnot because I dislike social media.I rely on and use social media for\nteaching and learning extensively.Really.But in going back to the pillars that\nunderlie whether or not we achieveand

words and a movieis worth a billion pictures.When it comes to drawing our attention.I mean, you give a young child,\neven an infant, an iPad, Imean, that kid is in the tunnel.I don't

captivates their attention,\nthen they're thinking about that.It might be something that brings\nthem delight, but more often thannot, it's something that brings\nthem either mild irritation or mildentertainment, maybe even intense\nentertainment for a short while.But very quickly, minutes and hours go by\nin which we are not engaging in the worldunless we are posting valuable content.And so social media is a bit\nof a drain on these drives.I mean, it taps into these\ndrives in very strong ways.And all one has to do is observe\nthe behavior of people in publicspaces, now, in airports, on\ntrains, even in their cars.And people are essentially\nwatching TV all day long.And it does concern me, and I raise\nit because I feel like it can distractfrom our generative drive in a way

is happening that's\nunprecedented and very, very powerfuland potentially quite destructive.Paul Conti: Yeah.I think to understand this,\nI would cite this belief.I believe this to be true,\nthat human beings have a longhistory of underappreciating the\npower of the discoveries thatare then in their own hands.So we discover gunpowder.How long until we're shooting each other?We discover nuclear fission.Now, are we going to destroy the planet?So social media, in a\nsense, it's a discovery.It's a thing that comes from what we've\nfigured out as humans that now is there infront of us, and big, powerful discoveries\ndeserve to be treated with respect.Gunpowder is very powerful, and if\npeople need to hunt in order to survive,gunpowder can help them hunt without\ngetting hurt, and we'd be more successful.Nuclear fission has provided\nsome good things to humanity,but it can also destroy humanity.So I think the same is true here,\nthat what you're talking about issomething of immense power, and you\ncan see how, if it gets out of balance.So let's use the salient.So let's say the social\nmedia is too salient.That's going to make a problem.If it's too salient in the sense that\nthe person is always looking at thingsthat don't make them feel good enough.Well, that's not going to go well,\nand that's going to affect what'sin those other ten cupboards.And what is built on top of it.So then it gets into the unconscious\nmind, like, oh, I thought Iwas good enough until now.I'm looking at all this social\nmedia, and I realize I'm not.I mean, this is.People who treat teens often talk about\nthis, that you see something that youdidn't often see before, where a person\nwho might have gotten through a lotof formative years thinking like, oh,\nhow I look is okay, for example, thenis bombarding themselves with social\nmedia that tells them how they lookis not okay, and then that changes.Andrew Huberman: Absolutely.Or perhaps social media is just\nsimply absorbing a ton of time andenergy, but mostly time that could\nbe devoted to a generative force.Paul Conti: Right.That's the other side of it.So think about the example of\nthe person who, I know it wasn'tsocial media, but we were saying,\nwell, what if it were social media?That instead of 90 minutes a day, it's\n8 hours because there's an analog thereand we see a lot of this, then it's\ntaking something that can be good insense, you could say even should be good.There's enough out there in\nterms of learning and bolsteringthat why should it not be good.But it's not good because\nthe defenses then shift.Like if you're relying on it 10 hours a\nday, there has to be some denial, right?Because there are other\nthings to do in the world.There has to be some avoidance.There has to be some rationalization,\nlike something is going onthere that's not healthy.So if you tell me this person is utilizing\nsocial media 10 hours a day, they're notlooking at things that make them feel bad\nabout themselves, they're just doing it.Then I think, okay,\nsomething is out of balance.Now it may be that that person's\ndefenses are out of balance.So think about the example of the\nperson with the job they didn't like.Then their defensive structure changes.Then the thing that was good\nfor them, they rely on too much.And now it becomes something\nthat's not good for them, right?So then you go and look at what\nelse is out of balance here.What else is driving this now?Maybe it's being driven by the change\nin defense mechanisms, et cetera.Maybe it's the other way around that this\nperson just kind of habituated to doingmore and more and more and more of it.And then you would come at it in a\ndifferent way of, okay, can you slowlybut surely do less, replace the time\nwith things that were good before?Because you could then back that person\nout to where they were before, butyou're not going to back the person\nout to where they were before ifit's being driven by something else.So we again come to the curiosity.You tell me that person is on\nsocial media 14 hours a day.I'm curious.I want to understand what is\nthe balance of those drives.You've just told me a very\npowerful point about salience thatdoesn't sound like a good one.So already you're giving me clues\nabout where the drives are, whichmeans, where's that person at?What's going on in all those cabinets?Then you give more information.Now sit and talk with the person.Now you're going to understand what\nis the lay of the land here and howdo we go about making it better.Andrew Huberman: I love the\nconcept of the generative drive."

            "text": "First of all, because it's pro social.It brings about great things\nfor us and for the world.And what is better than peace,\ncontentment and delight.Especially when we remind ourselves that\nthose are active phrases or those can beachieved and experienced inside of action.It's not just sitting, levitating,\nnavel gazing, that sort of thing.So it's not enlightenment, right.It's peace, contentment and delight.Paul Conti: Very big difference.Andrew Huberman: Very big difference.Yes.One of the other reasons I love this\nconcept of the generative drive so muchis also because it is a verb state.It has to do with creating things in\nus and in the world, in cultivatingour experience of things and what\nwe do and what we say and how werespond to what others do and say.And I also like it because it's distinct\nfrom the way that we're normally taughtto think about psychological well being\nor being a healthy individual, whichusually centers around a discussion of\ngoals and values and what am I tryingto focus on, and what sorts of people\ndo I want to engage with in the world?And certainly all of that is really\nimportant goals and who you engage with.But I think for many people out there,\nmuch of their time is spent thinkingabout other people, like how healthier\nor unhealthy are the people they'redating or their friends, or what's going\non between two family members, which,of course, is fine to think about.But a lot of emphasis is placed\non our assessments of othersand how those are impacting us.And in some cases, people default to\njust thinking about others and theirproblems and seeing their problems.And what we're really talking about\nhere is a process of introspectionand inquiry that's very structured.And as it's been laid out by\nyou, these two pillars, structureof self, function of self.With these ten cupboards, that might\nsound like a lot of cupboards, butas we talked about in the first\nepisode, all of that flows up to thesevery simple ideals and concepts and\naction, states and ways of being.And to me, there's nothing more\npowerful than the statementthat what we are all seeking are\nstates of agency and gratitude.Because, again, to go back to\nthe analogy of physical fitness,there are not an infinite number\nof different physical states orstates of fitness that one can seek.There's endurance, there's\nstrength, there's flexibility,there's dynamic movement, there's\nexplosiveness, there's speed.There are a bunch of subtleties to it.But here it really seems that the\npsyche, ourselves and our mentalhealth is really tractable if we\nturn the lens and we look inward.Paul Conti: Yes, I think that hits\nupon a very, very important pointas we talk about understanding\noneself and the process of change.And I would describe that\nas rational aspiration.So let's use the physical health example.If I think, okay, I want to be healthier,\nI want to have more strength, I wantto have more endurance, and I might\neven have ideas of what that would be.I want to be able to run a certain\ndistance in a certain time, lifta certain amount of weight, I\nhave an idea of what that is it.But rational aspiration\nis rooted in our present.I'm aware that there's a me\nnow that isn't in that state.And I'm aware that there are things\nthat I'm going to do to get to thatstate and I'm not that dreading them,\nlike, okay, they'll be difficult, right?But that's okay, I can do\ndifficult things, I can takepride in doing difficult things.And that's how we all achieve things.So I see myself in the present\nbecause of course goals are good,and that's true as long as we're\nstill living our lives in the presentbecause otherwise goals just become\nfantasies or things we want to possess.So if I'm aware of the state of physical\nhealth I'm in right now, and I'm awareof the state of physical health I want\nto be in, and I know there's a bunchof pathways I could take to get there,\nbut I have to think about it, figureit out, do those things, and then\nI'm going to navigate myself there.That's how the whole process is good.I don't feel bad about myself now.I recognize something\nI would like to change.I'm not saying, oh, you're\na loser, because you don'thave those things, right?I feel good about myself now.I recognize there's something I want\nand there's going to be a process,a process across time, across effort\nthat's going to navigate me there.Then when I get there, I\nfeel good about being there.It's very, very different\nif I think I want that.I want to possess in a sense.I want to possess the ability to run\na certain distance in a certain time.I just want the thing.I'm covetous of the thing.That is not good, right?Because a person then often\nis denigrating to the self.Not always, but that's a motivation to\ngo out and get that thing that's better.And they're really lamenting\nthe process of getting.They just want something as an endpoint.And that doesn't make for happiness,\nit doesn't make for even thehumility and humility in action,\nthe gratitude, the humility is,I can't just do that overnight.I'm going to have to work hard.People have to work hard.I'm no different than anybody else.I'm not special.I got to get in there and work and use the\nelbow grease, and then I'll get healthier.Like all of that is good.That I just want to possess\nsomething is not good.And that's why people in scenarios like\nthis, they might go through maybe inan unthinking way or they're gutting\nit out or wherever they go, and theyget that thing, right, but then that t\nhing is not enough and they want more.Now, there's nothing wrong with wanting\nmore if it's the healthy inaction of self.I'm going to now map my way.This feels better.I want to map myself from here to the\nnext level of better physical fitness.That's different than\nI just want that thing.Because then if I get it,\nit won't be good enough.It doesn't make me happy.It doesn't satisfy me.And that's the unhealthy state of\njust wanting things to possess them.And then we don't feel good\nabout them, which is thethought of if you give people.If you give a person something,\nthey'll resent you for it.Again, we're painting it in a sort\nof certain way, the context of thatstatement, which I used to hear\na lot, even when I was younger,people would say that, right.And what were they trying to get at?What they were getting at is it\ndoesn't feel good if you didn'twork for something, right?Like if you didn't work very hard\nand you got a C, but I give youan A or somebody gives me an A.I know that that's not good.I know that I got the thing.I got the A.And I might feel happy in the moment\nbecause I wanted that thing, butthere's no real pleasure in it.There's no satisfaction, there's\nno contentment, there's no sense ofself, there's nothing generative.I didn't work hard enough\nto go from a C to an A.And that really brings us back\nto the self that we're growingon top of the structure.Right.And how that self is functioning.How it's striving.Because now we're really\ntalking about strivings.And if I'm going to strive for something\nand work hard to get it, will I get thegood feeling on the other side of it.And now we're living in\nthe generative space.Andrew Huberman: Well, I love the\nstructure of what you've laid out.Again...Paul Conti: Thank you.Andrew Huberman: The pillars of\nstructure of self and function ofself, with ten cupboards between\nthe two of them that, when explored,can seem a little bit complex.But they're really some very\nstraightforward types of inquiry thatanyone can go about, about self awareness\nand address potential defense mechanisms.What we're conscious of, maybe\nwhat we're not conscious of.Look at our behaviors and our strivings\nand how that flows up to these simpleideals again, of empowerment, humility,\nagency and gratitude as verbs.And then from that, peace,\ncontentment and delight.And the generative drive, which, gosh,\nif there ever was a more powerfulconcept and something to strive for,\nI don't think it exists, because thegenerative drive is extraordinary in the\nnumber of different ways it plays out,and it seems always positively right.And of course, the aggressive drive,\nthe pleasure drive, exists to varyingextents in all of us, but cannot be\nallowed to overcome the generativedrive if we're going to really thrive.So thank you again so\nmuch for this framework.And again, to remind people listening\nand watching that this framework ismapped out in a downloadable PDF.If people want to see it visually,\neven though we've touched on it severaltimes before, I really appreciate\nhow logical, clear and actionablethis framework is, and also that in\nproviding a framework for us, it givesus something to hold our mind to.I think I, and so many people out\nthere are familiar with being in astruggle and not being able to orient.Where am I in the struggle?Not knowing what to do?And you've provided some incredible points\nof reference for us to really focus on.Start asking questions about I and\nhow I see myself, what am I payingattention to, and so on and so forth,\nto really first anchor and orient, andthen be able to move forward in this\nprocess as many times as is required toget where we each and all want to go.So thank you so much for this.I know in our next discussion we're\ngoing to touch on the relationalaspects of human existence, not just\nselves, but interactions between selves,including some of the, let's call\nit, darker and unfortunate aspects ofhuman existence, like narcissists, and\nsome of the challenges of differentfull blown personality disorders.But also just in terms of building healthy\nrelationships between friends, romanticpartners, parents and children and\nsiblings and coworkers and all the rest.So thank you again for this\nincredibly rich knowledge that youprovided us, and a map forward.Paul Conti: You're very\nwelcome and thank you.I appreciate the opportunity\nto talk about it with you.Andrew Huberman: Great.Well, to be continued.Thank you for joining me for\ntoday's discussion about how toimprove your mental health with Dr."
