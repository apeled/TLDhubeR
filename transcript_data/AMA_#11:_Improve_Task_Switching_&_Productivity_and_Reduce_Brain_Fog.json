            "text": "The specific\nquestion is, is therea way to get better\nat task switching?Task switching is an\nincredibly interesting topic.It's something that\nplagues many people.That is, a lot of people have\nchallenges with task switching.It's also a topic that\npeople will often confusewith cognitive flexibility.All of us, unless\nit's been removed,have an area of our brain\ncalled the prefrontal cortex.The words prefrontal\ncortex actuallyrefers to a fairly varied real\nestate within the human brain.It's not one area\nof the human brain.Prefrontal cortex\nactually includes a lotof different subdivisions\nthat do different thingsin the context of cognition\nand directing action,withholding action,\nthese kinds of things.One of the main functions\nof the prefrontal cortexis that when it's\nworking well, itallows us to direct our\nfocus and our cognition,our thinking, in a\ncontext-dependent way.One of the simplest\nways to describe thisis that when you took\nmath in high schoolor if you're still\ntaking math, your brainhad to carry out certain\ntypes of cognitive operationsthat were very\ndifferent than the typesof cognitive operations\nthat you needto carry out in your history\nclass or your social studiesclass.There were some\nfeatures of all threeof those classes\nthat were the same,in the sense that\npresumably, youhad to sit in a chair\nfor all of those classes.You followed a\ncertain set of rulesthat pertained to all three\nof those different classes,even though there are\ndifferent subjects.But then, there were certain\nrules that pertained justto mathematics, certain\nrules that you followedbecause a particular teacher\nwas strict-- not becauseof the topic they\nwere covering--as well as certain rules that\nmaybe you did not pay attentionto because a different\nteacher was a little more lax.For instance, maybe\nthere was a teacherthat let you put your feet up\non the chair in front of you.Maybe, another teacher\nforbid that at all costs.The point being that\nyour prefrontal cortexis the area of your brain\nthat, along with other areasof your brain, ensures\nthat you engagein context-specific behavior,\ncontext-specific thinkingand context-specific\nunderstanding about whatyou should and should not do.Now, cognitive\nflexibility is similar,in the sense that it describes\nyour ability to switchthe types of\ncognitive operations--as the name suggests--depending on what\nsorts of thingsyou're trying to\nlearn or understand.It's a lot more\nextensive than that.In fact, we will probably\ndo an entire episodeall about both cognitive\nflexibility and perhaps,even a separate episode\non task switching.Task switching is\nsomewhat distinctfrom cognitive flexibility.First of all task, switching\nrequires cognitive flexibility,but they are not the same thing.Now, when we talk about\ntask switching-- or rather,when you see task switching\nin the scientific literature--most often, it has\nto do with peopleperforming one particular\ntype of mental or physicaloperation.Say, they're maneuvering\nthings with their handsor other parts of\ntheir body, or theyare required to carry\nout one specific typeof mental process.And then, they are required,\neither at random intervalsor at specific intervals--\nmaybe every 10 minutesor so-- to switch\ntheir attentionand to do a different\ntask entirely.In the laboratory\nexperiment situation,this has most typically been\ncarried out the following way.People are going to do\none cognitive task, maybemathematics, or they're going\nto count, for instance, from 1up to infinity, as\nhigh as they cango in a given amount of\ntime, in increments of say,7 or increments of 7\nplus 1 then 7 minus 1.These can be made increasingly\ndifficult. You get the idea.And then perhaps,\na tone is playedor they'll get a signal\nfrom the experimenter.They need to switch their\ntask to doing something quitedifferent, but also cognitive.That's the most\ntypical arrangement.Another typical arrangement\nin a task switching experimentis that the person in the\ntask switching experimentwill be asked to do some\nsort of physical manipulationof objects, maybe\nplacement of puzzle piecesinto the correct configuration.Then at some designated\ninterval or intervals,they will have to switch\nto a different manual task.Fewer-- not zero, but\nfewer-- experimentshave examined task\nswitching betweenphysical and cognitive tasks.There are these kind\nof outrageous examplesthat you can find\non the internet.By the way, I don't\nsuggest that anyonego engage in these examples\nin real life of extreme taskswitching.One of the most notable\nones would be chess boxing.Believe it or not,\nthis exists, wheretwo people will enter a ring.They will sit down at a table.They will play chess for\na given period of time.They're entirely focused\non playing chess.Then a buzzer will go off.The chess table will be cleared.The chairs will be cleared.They will be expected\nto box, literallyfight, for a round of a\nminute to three minutes,and then, go back to chess,\nthen to boxing, so-called chessboxing.Again, I'm not suggesting\npeople chess box.But I know that many people have\nchallenges with task switching.Here, I can raise my hand and\nsay that I am one such person.I've always had a pretty good\nability to drop into deep focusafter a period of time.I, like everybody else,\ntake a little bit of timeto get into a book\nchapter or to getinto a mode of\nphysical exercise.But once I'm doing\nsomething, I tendto be very focused on that.I have a much greater\nchallenge in switching outof that focused mode to\ndoing the next thing, whichis one of the reasons why\noftentimes, I run tardy,because I'm still mentally\nthinking about or physicallyengaged in the thing\nthat I was doing before.This is something I'm\nconstantly working on.As a consequence, I've had\nto seek out and implementcertain tools to improve\nmy ability to task switch.I'm going to share a few\nof those tools with younow, because I know\na number of peopleprobably struggle\nwith the same thing.As I mentioned\nearlier, I'm also goingto do a full-length episode\nabout task switching,both the underlying mechanisms\nof task switching as wellas a more extensive\nlist of tools relatedto task switching, as a\nfull-length Huberman Labpodcast episode.How can we get better\nat task switching?Short of having somebody\nscruff you by the neckand force you to stop\nwhatever activity you're doingand engage in the next\nactivity that you're doing,one of the best\nthings that we cando to support our ability to\ntask switch-- that's nicelysupported both at\nthe mechanistic leveland at the practical\nlevel within the publishedliterature-- is to\nintroduce short transitiongaps between the activities that\nwe're trying to switch between.This is something\nthat, in my opinion,has not been discussed enough.In fact, when was the last time\nyou heard about the requirementfor introducing\ngaps between tasksif you want to switch between\nthem more efficiently?And yet, as a\nconsequence of thisnot being discussed very\noften, I think a lot of peoplehave placed an undue\nburden on themselves.For instance, a lot of\npeople think that whenyou sit down with a book\nand you're going to read,that you should be able\nto immediately focuson the material\nthat you're readingand not have your\nmind flitting about.During the first five,\nmaybe even 10 minutesof reading a book chapter,\nunless you are absolutelyenthralled from the\nfirst word, or youare intensely curious what the\nmaterial in that book chapteris--maybe that book\nchapter is about youand what's going to happen\nto you next in your life.Maybe the news article\nis about somethingthat you care oh so much about.But unless it's one of\nthose specific instances,it's going to be\nabout five or 10minutes before the\nneural circuitsin your brain that are\nrequired to understandand digest and commit\nthat material to memoryare going to come online at\nthe levels of activity thatare going to be required\nfor you to experiencethat as intense focus,\nor even as mild focus.The activity of\nthe brain is alwaysgoing to be in a push-pull.This is extremely important for\nunderstanding task switching.When you go from one task--and maybe the task was\nsimply to walk overto where the book is located--to focusing on the\nmaterial within that book,you have to both engage activity\nwithin certain neural circuitsand you need to\ndisengage the activityof other neural circuits.Sometimes, this is\nreferred to as inhibitionof certain neural circuits.Other times, it's just going\nto be a dissipation of activityof those neural circuits.They're just going\nto quiet down,like a dimming of the\nlights in a particular room,while the activity of other\nneural circuits increases.The first thing that you\nreally need to understand,if you want to get\nbetter at task switching,is that you cannot and you\nshould not expect yourselfto immediately drop into\na narrow trench of focus,or a narrow trench of ability,\nfor anything that you're notalready extremely skilled\nat or extremely interestedin knowing.One of the reasons why\nthis is often overlookedis that, for instance,\nif we receive a textmessage from somebody and we\nare very interested in what'scontained in that text message,\nmaybe even eagerly anticipatingthe dot, dot, dot in\nthat little windowwhere the text message is going\nto arrive-- like here it comes.Here it comes.Here it comes.It's an example of where you\nare able to immediately payattention and\nabsorb information.For instance, if you're trying\nto meet somebody in a big city,and you need to know\nexactly where to meet them,and you've arrived\nat the place whereyou thought you need to be\nand then, you can't find them.You're waiting.Where are you?Where are you?You're going to commit\nthat information to memoryand you're going to act on it.But when you sit down to read\na book of unknown content,or where you have just a general\nsense of what the content is,or when you sit down to\ndo something like workon a spreadsheet or\nyour taxes, or engagein a conversation with somebody,\nexpect a five to 10 minutetransition period.I can't emphasize this enough,\nbecause I think a lot of peoplemistakenly think that they\nhave issues with attention.Perhaps indeed, they have\nclinically diagnosableattention deficit\nhyperactivity disorderor some other form of\nattention deficit disorder.I certainly can't rule that\nout based on this conversationalone.But a lot of people place this\nunfair burden on themselvesto immediately be able\nto focus on a given task.This is also true\nfor physical tasks.If you go to the gym to work\nout or you're heading outon a run or a\ncycling expedition,the idea that you would\nimmediately be able to cycleat your peak performance, or\nthat you could perform setsand reps in the gym as\nbest as you possiblycould without any warm-up,\nwithout any transition period,that you could forget about the\ndifficult or maybe even greatconversation that you\nwere having on the way in,or that you could forget\nabout other activitiesthat you need to do in\nthe rest of your day,that's just completely unfair.It doesn't match at all the way\nthat your neural circuits work.You really need to match your\nexpectation of your abilityto focus on and\nperform a given task,whether or not it's\ncognitive or physical, tothe actual underlying biology.That's the first point.The second point is that we know\nthat if you want to switch fromone task to another task,\nthat you are making it moredifficult to drop into full-task\nengagement-- or rather,engagement with task\nB following task A,if you try and go immediately\nfrom task A to task B--that even the introduction--I find this so cool--\neven the introductionof an arbitrary but very short\ntransition period of say,15 seconds, where you know\nthat you're introducing15 seconds of transition and\nyou designate it as transition,will allow you to engage in\na more efficient and morecomplete level of task\nexecution on task Bif you introduce even a\nbrief transition period.This I find fascinating,\nbecause what this meansis that there are\ntop down influences.There are literally things\nthat we can tell ourselves,based on an understanding of\nthe underlying mechanisms, thatallow us to task switch better.This certainly doesn't involve\ntaking any kind of prescriptiondrug or supplement or\ndoing anything differently,except as you go from\ntask A to task B,knowing and designating that a\ntransition period, even a verybrief one where you are not\ntrying to perform task Band that you've designated\nthis as a transition period.I'm not trying to focus on the\nnext thing that I need to do.I might focus on\nit inadvertently,but I'm not deliberately\ntrying to focus on it.Rather, I'm going to think\nabout what I just didand the fact that I'm no longer\ndoing that, kind of leaving itlike a fog behind.You're trying to move from\nthis deep trench of attention,hopefully on task\nA-- or maybe, youdidn't achieve a deep\ntrench of attention--and you're now done\nwith task A. You're notplacing this unfair expectation\non your neural circuitsto just flip to task B.\nYou're also acknowledgingthat task B is going to take\nfive to 10 minutes to dropinto fully.We already talked about that.But you're going to shorten\nthat five to 10 minutesby deliberately introducing\na transition period.What comes in that transition\nperiod and its durationis important.First, let's deal\nwith the duration.How long should the\ntransition period be?That is going to scale\ndirectly with how long youare in a deep trench of\nfocus for task A. Let'sassume task A was something\nthat was kind of light for you.Maybe, you're just\nhandling some email.Maybe, you're talking\nto a coworker.Maybe, you were\nat a board meetingand it was kind of light.The stuff was just OK.You're used to this stuff.This is stuff that\nyou do all the time.Now, you're headed\nback to your deskor you're headed\nto your next class.Or perhaps, you did a\nworkout that morningand now, you're going to\nhead to your place of work.Or maybe, you're\nleaving work and you'regoing to engage with family.You know need to switch all\nthese cognitive operations.You need to dump the\nstuff that you were justdoing cognitively,\nand you now needto do a bunch of other things.Context is switching.Task is switching.Just ask yourself,\nhow deeply was Ientrenched in that\nother activity?Was my mind flitting\nto other things?If I was in a deep trench of\nattention for that given thing,then you should give\nyourself slightly longerfor this transition period,\nmaybe five or even 10 minutesif you have that time.Even if you give yourself\nas short as 60 to 90 secondsof transition and you just\ndesignate it as transition,you're going to benefit\nin terms of your abilityto do the next task.To be very clear, if you\nwere in kind of a light taskor something that didn't\nhave much cognitive demand,then the transition period\ncan be fairly short.It can be just a\ncouple of minutes.Rather, if you were in a\ndeep trench of attention,you really engaged\nin that first task,I suggest giving\nyourself a coupleof minutes or more, maybe as\nmuch as five to 10 minutes.But you might not\nhave that much time.In which case, give yourself\nany kind of transition,even if it's 10 seconds.I certainly have had\ntimes in my life,in particular when I was a new\nassistant professor before Igot tenure, where I\nremember sitting downto work on a grant.I'd get two lines out.Someone would knock on the door.Hey, where are the whatever,\nthe 30 mil syringes?Where do we keep the buffers?Did we get this thing in?And then, I'd have\nto shift my attentionand go back to writing.I'd be distracted by\nsomething else again.Which is not to say that people\nwere distracting me unfairly.It was simply the case\nthat, at that time,my life required being\ninvolved in a lot more thingsthan it did as my\ncareer progressed,at least in the short term.The point being that if you are\ndeeply engaged in an activity,give yourself a little bit\nlonger in the transition periodbetween them.If you are sort of superficially\ninvolved in an activity,you need less of a\ntransition period.But you need a\ntransition period.What should come during\nthat transition period?The most important thing to\narrive in that transitionperiod is a relative lack of\nattention to anything new.This is what's so\ndestructive about the phone.Keep in mind, I am not one\nof these people that thinksthat smartphones are terrible.In fact, I use mine plural,\nvery often, all day, often.Not necessarily\nduring deep cognitivefocus, but in between\nthose bouts of focus,I have to text message people.I do work on there.I'm on social\nmedia, so certainlynot demonizing the smartphone.However, if you finish\na given activity--whether or not it's cognitive\nor physical activity--and you are headed to something\nelse that requires you do a newtask, and that task\nrequires significant amountsof attention and focus, then\nyou would do very well to allowyourself a period of anywhere\nfrom two minutes to maybe,as long as 10 minutes--I know this is going to\nbe very hard for people--but two minutes to\nas long as 10 minuteswhere you are not\nlooking at your phone.You're not texting.You're not on social media.You're not foraging\nfor anything.In fact, you're trying to limit\nthe total amount of informationthat you're bringing\ninto your nervous system.Now, you don't have to walk\naround with eyes closedand try and not\nhear and not see.Let's be practical, folks.That's impossible to do anyway.You can't shut down\nyour brain while awake.You can go into states\nof deeper relaxation.There's a non-sleep\ndeep rest, which we'lltalk about in a little bit.But you can't shut off\nyour brain deliberately,not in any healthy way that is.But by introducing these\ntransition zones, or transitionperiods as we'll call\nthem, of two to 10 minutesbetween different\ntasks, and making surethat within those\ntransition periods,you are not bringing in\nnew information-- again,another context and what\nare you really doing?You're ensuring that you're\nnot going from task A to task Bto task C.What we're talking\nabout here is tryingto limit your task switching\nbetween task A and task Band not introducing\nanother task in between.You might think that looking\nat your phone is not a task.It's so easy.It's so reflexive.But it is.It's bringing in a\nlot of new context,in particular pictures\nand movies whichare tremendous stimulus\nfor the nervous systemand anchoring your attention.It's bringing in new\nideas, new thoughtsthat no matter how\nhard you try, aregoing to intrude into your\nability to perform task B. Whenpeople say, how do I get\nbetter at task switching,I immediately want\nto say, pleasedon't introduce yet more tasks.Switching from one task to\nanother is hard enough already.Don't introduce another\ntask in between.Some of you might\ntake this to meanthat you shouldn't\nhave a conversationwith a coworker after a meeting\nwhile walking down the hall.I'm not saying that.I still encourage\npeople to be social.I encourage people to engage\nin workplace environments.However, I will say,\nafter many yearsof working in laboratories\nthat at times were quitelarge, if you walk\ninto the lab and thereare a lot of different\nthings going on,one of the things that\nyou learn how to do,if you're going to get\ngood at your craft,is to not pay\nattention to what'sgoing on with everyone crowded\naround a computer lookingat who's winning\nat the World Cup.I'm not trying to insult\nsoccer players here.I enjoy soccer, both\nplaying it and observing it.But one has to scruff themselves\na little bit in tryingto limit their attention to\na number of different thingsin the environment, and\nreally go from task Ato task B in a\nreally dedicated way.Short lists benefit\ncertain people.I know a lot of people\nare list makers out there.They like to put two or three\nthings, or maybe 20 thingsthat they're going to\naccomplish each day.One of the best\ntools that I everlearned, both for the\nsake of task switchingbut also for sake of\njust getting thingsdone on a consistent basis--I picked up while I\nwas a master's studentat Berkeley-- a very\naccomplished professorat that time told me that he\nwrites down every day threethings that he's\ngoing to accomplishand only three things,\nnever more than three.He also included\nother activities.In fact, he was quite\nactive in his physical life.He rode his bike to campus.He also was a runner.He also went to the gym.He did not include those on\nhis list of three things.He would write down no more\nthan three critical thingsto do each day.He had three critical tasks.I've employed that\nmethod as well.I'll write down one, sometimes\ntwo, most often three,but if I can, just one\nor two tasks that Ineed to complete each day.Everything else is\nconsidered part of the,let's just say,\nautomaticity functionof my day, things that I\nalready know how to do.They don't require a\nton of cognitive focus.But I limit the\nthings that requirea lot of cognitive focus\nto three things per day.However, those\nthree things per daycan take up many,\nmany hours eachand certainly, on the whole.There are additional\nthings that onecan do to improve your\nability to task switch.One of the things that I\nfound particularly beneficialis not a meditation, but rather,\nis a perceptual exercise.This is a perceptual\nexercise that Ilearned about when I\nwas a graduate student,but in a totally\ndifferent context.It has to do with the way\nthat your visual systemand the parts of your\nbrain that parse timeare related to one another\nand influence one another.The reason this tool makes\nsense for improving your abilityto task switch is\nbecause it turns outthat where you focus your\nvisual attention stronglyinfluences the way that\nyour brain parses time.I'll describe the tool first.And then, I'll get a little bit\ninto the underlying mechanisms.Again, I'll get deep into the\nunderlying mechanisms, as wellas the tool, as well\nas additional tools,in a future episode about task\nswitching on the Huberman Labpodcast.If you were to, for\ninstance, close your eyesand not look at anything in\nyour external environmentand just concentrate,\nfor instance,on your breathing or the feeling\non the surface of your skin--I know this is starting to sound\nlike meditation, but trust me,it's not meditation--your perception of time,\nthat is, how finely youare slicing time, would\nbe distinctly differentthan if you were\nto open your eyesand focus on a faraway location,\nsay way off in the horizon,and not focus on your\nbodily sensations.Similarly, if you were\nto focus your attentionon some intermediate\nlocation, maybe,let's say, 20 feet away\nand simultaneously,focus on your internal\nbodily sensationsor the surface of your skin,\nyour perception of time howquickly time was\npassing would alsobe different than if\nyou closed your eyesor if you were looking\nat some distant location.The perceptual tool for task\nswitching is a very simple one.It's one that frankly,\nI do every morningand have for many years now and\nat least, for me, has reallyenhanced my ability\nto task switch.That is, just take\na couple of minutes.This really only takes\nabout two or three minutes.Typically, what I will do is,\nI'll start by closing my eyes.I should mention,\nI typically do thisin an environment\nwhere ideally, Ican see off into the distance,\nperhaps from a balconyif I'm in an apartment or\na house, ideally outdoors.But if I'm indoors,\nI'll still do this.I'll just look as far\noff into the distanceas I can when that\nstep is required.I start off by closing my eyes\nand essentially not lookingat anything, but\ndirecting my brain's focusto either the\nsurface of my body,just what it feels like, what\nit's in contact with or notin contact with,\nmaybe my breathing.Then, I'll open\nmy eyes and I willfocus on some location on my\nbody but my bodily surface,like my hand at some distance.I'll focus my\nattention there maybefor just five to 15 seconds.I should mention that\nthe first station,as I call them, where\nmy eyes were closedand I was focusing on\nmy bodily sensations,I also just do that for\nabout five to 15 seconds.I don't count specifically,\njust roughly five to 15 seconds.Second station, you're looking\nat the surface of your hand.If you like, you can also\nconcentrate on your breathing.But typically, people will just\nfocus on some specific locationon their hand.Then, I'll typically\nlower my hand.Then, I'll look off\ninto the distance, maybefive to 10 feet.It doesn't really matter.Focus my visual attention there.Try and hold that focus\nfor five to 15 seconds.Then, I'll look further off in\nthe distance, maybe, furtherstill off into the distance.Ultimately, what I try and\ndo is look at a locationas far off into the\ndistance as I possibly can.I'm also trying to pay\nattention to my breathingat the same time, just\nas a way of calibratingmy location to the location\nthat I'm looking atand how great that is.Then typically,\nI'll close my eyesand return my attention to\nmy immediate environmentand my breathing just\nin the location I'm in.The entire thing only\ntakes about two minutes.Again, starting with eyes\nclosed, focusing on self fiveto 15 seconds.Then, eyes open, focusing on\nsurface of one's body, that is,focusing one's visual attention\nfive to 15 seconds maybe10 feet away, then\nmaybe, 50 feet away.If you're in the metric system,\nmeters works just as well.These distances do not\nhave to be precise.And then, off to the\nhorizon and then,back to one's immediate\nlocation by closing one's eyes.What is happening when one\ndoes this perceptual exercise?Again, it's a\nperceptual exercise.It's a visual\nperceptual exercise.What's happening\nis, you are shiftingyour visual focus, obviously.But you're also shifting\nthe way in which youfine slice or thick slice time.Your ability to recognize,\nconsciously, whether or notyour thin slicing or thick\nslicing time is much harderto get a grasp of than it\nis to get a grasp of whetheror not you're looking at your\nhand or off in the distance.That's kind of obvious.But what we know for\nsure is that as youshift your attention from\nyour immediate environmentout to different designated\nlocations in your environment,and your time perception\nshifts accordingly,you're essentially\ntraining your brainto shift visual focus\nand the way in which youprocess in the time domain.This is important in the\ncontext of task switching,because so much\nof task switchingis not just to\nunderstand OK, I'mgoing from reading to running\nor from running to readingand the different types of\noperations that are requiredin one case versus\nthe other, but also,a shift in the neural\ncircuits that underlieyour perception of time.Again, this is a topic\nthat deserves a much moreelaborate discussion.So much of our ability\nto execute a taskwith high proficiency\nhas to do with gettingour thinking and our actions\ninto the correct time domain.When I say time domain,\nI know a number of peoplecan get confused\nbecause time is time.People think, what do\nyou mean by time domain?Space domain makes sense.Here, I'm not talking\nabout outer space,whether or not you're looking\nin one location or another closeto your body or far\naway from your bodyare different domains of space.But the time domain is a\nlittle trickier for most peopleto understand.Just think of it this way.When you see a slow motion\nmovie, what you're seeingis a movie that was\nshot at a high framerate, many frames per second.The typical smartphone\nshoots moviesat about 60 frames per\nsecond, some older ones,30 frames per second.The slow-mo function\non your smartphoneis actually a high\nframe rate function.You took the same movie, but you\ntook it at a higher frame rate.You've got a lot more images.Therefore, you can\ngenerate slow motion.With your visual\nsystem, when youfocus very close in\nto your body or you'refocused on bodily sensations\nin your immediate environment,you are fine slicing\nin the time domainmore so than when\nyou are lookingfurther off in the distance.Similarly, when you engage\nin one type of task,like a board meeting\nor a Zoom meetingor a conversation\nwith friends, youare in a very different set\nof neural circuit functionsthan when you sit down to read\nor learn math or lift weightsor go to therapy or go\nfor a walk with your dog,for instance.Now, it should be clear why\nwhen you move from task to taskyou want to A, introduce\na transition period.It can be very brief.Maybe, you don't even have time\nfor the two minute transitionperiod.You just say, OK.I'm in a transition period\nbetween task A and taskB. I'm moving from this\nthing to that thing.I just need like 10 seconds.I'm going to recognize.I'm going to count down\n10 to one or one up to 10.It doesn't matter.This is transition time.But this is not a time\nto look at my phoneor to be in lots of\ndifferent time domains.You might say,\nwell, does that meanI shouldn't look at\nthe horizon while I'mwalking from my meeting\nback to my desk?No.That's not the way\nthat your brain works.It doesn't anchor to\nthings that just happento be in your environment unless\nthey're of particular interest.What I'm saying is, set a\ntransition period between tasksideally, two maybe as\nlong as 10 minutes.I'm also saying that when\nyou switch between tasks,or when you initiate your\nfirst major task of the day,please expect--do expect-- a\nperiod in which it'shard to get into the\ngroove, so to speak.In addition to that, I recommend\nhaving some of practice.I described the\npractice that I'veused for some period of\ntime now, at least for meto great success, where\nyou are deliberatelyshifting your visual attention\nbetween different locationsclose to you and far away.You're doing that as\na perceptual practice.Again, the whole thing only\ntakes about two minutes,maybe three minutes.You don't even need\nto do it every day.I happen to do it every day,\nbut I miss the occasional dayhere and there.Even if you were to do this\nperceptual practice once a weekor three times a week, I'm\ncertain that you'll benefit.Because in doing that\nperceptual practice,there's also an\nimmediate recognitionof the sorts of shifts\nthat your brain is requiredto engage in any time you\nmove from task A to task Bor from task B to\ntask C. You startto see and feel,\nliterally see and feel,the way that transition occurs.It takes a little bit of time.But you can accelerate\nthat transitionif you understand that oh, when\nI'm looking here and engagingin this type of behavior\nor sets of tasksand then, I'm now\ngoing to be expectedto do another task\nin a completelydifferent type of environment,\nthe brain is goingto be required to shift over\nthe neural circuits thatare active and less active\nin order to do that.You can accelerate that\nprocess by practicingit using that perceptual\ntool that I described.There, I covered\nsome specific toolsthat one can use to enhance\none's ability to task switch,touching on a bit of the\nunderlying neurobiologyand why transition periods\nare useful, if not required.If you think about there's\nalways a transition period whentask switching, but here,\nyou're taking conscious controlover that transition period.There are additional tools\nfor enhancing one's abilityto task switch.They tend to be somewhat\nspecific for the certain kindsof cognitive or physical\ntasks that one needs to do.The example of chess\nboxing that I gave earlier,a great example\nof task switchingat its extreme, terrible\nexample of a practicespace-time bridging.Very safe, I can't think\nof any way in which itmight be dangerous,\nalthough please don't do itwhile driving or while\noperating any other machinery.By all accounts,\nvery safe, zero cost.We talked about some\nof the other toolsfor task switching as well.Thank you for joining\nfor the beginning"

First, it was launched in order to raise support for the standard Huberman Lab podcast channel \u2014 which will continue to come out every Monday at zero-cost. Second, it was launched as a means to raise funds for important scientific research. A significant portion of proceeds from the Huberman Lab Premium subscription will fund human research (not animal models) selected by Dr. Huberman, with a dollar-for-dollar match from the Tiny Foundation.\nSubscribe to Huberman Lab Premium at www.hubermanlab.com/premium."
