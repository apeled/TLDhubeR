            "text": "the words agency and gratitude I thinkagency and ability to affect the worldaround me in the ways that I want and Ithink gratitude being thankful and wedid an entire episode all aboutgratitude practices some of theneuroscience and neuroimaging andneurochemical changes that occur in thebrain and body when people exert agratitude practice but I have a feelingthat when you talk about agency andgratitude you might be talking aboutsomething slightly or maybe even quite abit different than the way that I'mdefining it yeah I would say agency andgratitude are these amazing rewardsright that sit on top of the highlycomplex brain function inside of us andthe highly complex psychology in all ofus so if we think about a self rightthat I identify a self right I'm an eyeright if I'm going to approach the worldwith agency and gratitude that's sittingon on top of a lot of healthy thingsright and the idea that okay there areways in which we can be mentallyunhealthy right but to start with likewhat is going on inside of us right andwhat does it look like when we'rehealthy so there's a structure of theself right there's function of the selfand if we look at the structure and thefunction and the parts the components ofstructure and function we can come tounderstand okay what is going on in uswhat might we change for the better howdo we build empowerment right is itempowerment is is the the theability to navigate the world around usand to bring myself to bear in ways thatare effective and from empowermentarises the sense of agency right I haveagency because I am empowered right andalso from a healthy structure of selfand function of self we end up withhumility right we come through that witha sense of our our place in the worldand our power in the world to tonavigate as we choose but also a senseof the world around us that's far morecomplicated right than just we areextends Beyond us to other people to theclimate around us to the health of thewhole planet right we we feel a sense ofhumility that I'm here and I can do goodthings I'm fortunate to be here and I'mpart of this bigger ecosystem right allthe way up to the scale of the ecosystemof earth right and if we feel thathumility then we approach the worldthrough the lens of gratitude so theidea that a healthy structure of selfand a healthy function of self leads toempowerment and humility and then uponthat we are we are sort of imbued withagency and gratitude and that leads usforth to happy lives okay so it's clearto me why having agency and gratitudewould be wonderful perhaps even the goalstate that we should all be seeking toachieveand it also makes sense to me as to whyempowerment and humility are importantcomponents that feed into our ability tohave agency and gratitude yes rightbecause all of thatat least to my mind sums to in a veryclear statement about having agency andgratitude is the best way to approachlife that all makes perfect sense to meand yet I've never really thought aboutit that way and I think most peoplehaven't ever been told this right I meanwhat should we be seeking agency andgratitude yes so we've heard endlessnumber of podcasts including thispodcast about physical health and we'vebeen told by physicians and everybodyelse that you know we should seek tohave a relatively low blood pressure weshould seek to have a relatively lowheart rate that our cholesterol shouldbe at a certain levelEtc So within the physical health domainyou know there are strong clear messagesabout what we should all be strivingtoward and in a similar way to how we'rediscussing the self and psychology youknow I don't think anyone seeks to havelow blood pressure or low heart ratebecause that's what they want per sethey want those things along with somecapacity for endurance the ability to toyou know lift an object so some strengthEtc because of the way that thosemetrics of Health allow them to movethrough the world in the best possibleway in other words having some degree ofendurance allows you to walk down theblock maybe a lot further or to walk upseveral flights of stairs or to havesome strength allows you to pick upobjects and effectively move throughlife rightyou're telling us that having a sense ofagency and gratitudeand that agency and gratitude areundergirded by empowerment and humilityand that's the best way to move throughlife the most effective happiest if youwill way to move through lifewell then I think we have to askourselves the same thing we would askabout physical fitness which is whatgoes into creating a sense of agency andgratitude empowerment and humility youknow what are the action steps becauseif I want more endurance I know to geton an exercise bike or or a treadmill orgo out for a run a few times a week ormore if I want to get stronger I'm goingto lift objects that are difficult tolift until they're easier to lift I meanso pretty straightforward in thephysical domain but in the in the mentalhealth domain in the psychologicaldomain it does become a bit moreabstract I think in part because noone's ever told us certainly no one'sever told me what you really need and isagency and gratitude in order to havethe best possible life so I very muchappreciate that you're telling us thisand I'd love for you to tell us what arethe action steps that go into creating"

            "text": "of understanding I think you describethem as the structure of the self andthe functions of the self again just todraw a parallel if we were talking aboutphysical health we'd say okay there'sconnections between nerves and musclethat allows us to move our limbs if youapply a certain amount of resistance youget a certain adaptation which is thethe neuromuscular connection getsstronger the muscle might get bigger orjust stronger Etcflexibility you know you just push yourrange of motion just a little bit intodiscomfort you do that we it so happensto be the case that you do that for justa couple of minutes each day over thecourse of about a week or so you get asignificant increase in flexibility okayso it's all very clear in the physicaldomain in the psychological domain Ihear you telling us that the actionsteps that we all should be taking inorder to be the happiest version ofourselves by achieving agency andgratitudeis to explore the structure of self andthe function of selfso if you could tell us about what isthe structure of self like what goesinto Andrew being Andrew and Paul beingPaul and whoever The Listener is intobeing who they are what is that and whatis the function of self how how does apsychiatrist think about that how shouldwe think about that okay if I couldstart maybe to set the stage for thatright by pointing out that as we go upthe hierarchy right of Health righteverything should get simpler right notmore complicated right if you thinkabout physical health right there's somuch complexity on the initial levelsright so we think about you know yourphysical health status versus mine rightit's going to be different right we'regoing to have different cardiac functionand muscle function and pulmonaryfunction and if we're going to behealthy we could do a lot of differentthings right there might be a whole setof choices that would work well for youdifferent choices that would work for meand we can gauge intensity timingfrequency right it's very complicatedwhen we're on and the the lower levelsof the hierarchy as we get higher uplet's say you and I both do the rightthings right then what happens we bothhave endurance right we both have somestrength we're both robust right thingsare getting simpler because we're we'reapproaching the unique idiosyncrasies inall of us right and we have to look atthat and look at that in a very specificway but what we're trying to get to isis something that's common for all of usso stamina for example in physicalhealth and endurance right and agencyand gratitude in mental health right sothen if we go and we look and we look atthe structure of the self and thefunction of self we find that there'smore complexity but that it is alsounderstandable I mean there's tremendouscomplexity in the body just as there'stremendous complexity in the mind and wecan understand what is the structure ofself what is the function of self and wecan look at that and assess that in thesame way we would physical healthparameters so that we arrive at theplace we want to be be it endurance oragency or gratitude so structure of selfright we all have an unconscious mindright and we pay so little attention tothis part of us that really is thebiological supercomputer right somillions of things are going on all thetime like in every Split Second so forexample I can say these words right youcan listen to the words you can saythings back and I can listen right thereare millions and millions of thingsgoing on under the surface much of whichcomes from either biologicalpredispositions right or habits overtime right thought processes patternsright so this unconscious mind thissuper computer is doing all of thesethings like you know at the speed oflight right there are electrical andchemical signals and you know multiplePathways as common as complicated assuper highway systems that then getConsolidated and communicate with othersright and then what comes up from all ofthat is the conscious mind so imagine aniceberg right and it's a really reallybig Iceberg right and and we see thepart above the surface right that's theconscious mind right but there's a hugepart of this Iceberg maybe 95 of itthat's underneath the water rightthere's this hulking mass that we don'tsee that's the unconscious mind rightand it's feeding up to the consciousmind which is a much smaller part of ourbrain function right but it's the partthat we're aware of right it's sittingon top of all the unconscious thingswhich are extremely important but thenwe become aware so that we can engage inthe real world in order for us to havethis conversation the millions of thingsper second have to be going onunderneath the surface so that you and Ias conscious eyes right as consciousselves Can Ride Along on top of it sothat's the part of the iceberg that'sabove of the water it's the consciousitself then imagine that the consciousself is girded by by a a set ofum you know long uh tendrils that comeout from under the water right thattheir defense mechanisms that areunconscious to us that sort of gird theconscious mind so do we rationalizeautomatically do we avoid automaticallydo we act out automatically are thesethings in Us in ways that we can observeand change but that are there to try andprotect the conscious mind from the theslings and arrows of the world around usright so if you imagine there's the bigpart of the iceberg under the water theunconscious mind the conscious mind isriding on top of it but the consciousmind that part sticking out of the wateris vulnerable right so imagine thatthere's a defensive structure then thatarises from the part of the icebergthat's underwater that is there todefend and protect the conscious mindSo when you say to defend and protect"

            "text": "when you say that the conscious mind isvulnerablewhat do you mean do you mean that it'svulnerable to physical attack or thatit's vulnerable to us realizing thatwe're just a bunch of neurons that areclicking away underneath like in otherwords where does the vulnerability ofthe conscious mind really resideum not physically where does it residebut you know what am I so worried aboutin terms of my safety I mean right nowwe're in a room I feel pretty safeum I don't think you're going to attackme verbally or physically I suppose it'spossible that could happen but it seemslike a very distant possibility So whenyou say that these defenses are there toprotect us from some sort of awarenesswhat awareness are we trying to avoid sothe the vulnerability of the consciousmind is to fear confusion despair rightthere's so many things that that we canfear right some people are afraid ofsnakes or spiders some people are afraidof death some people are afraid ofhealth issues that could come to them orto people they love we can get confusedand not know what decisions to make andhow to navigate the world and how to bewho we want to be to ourselves and toothers right we can feel tremendouslyvulnerable and despairing if we loseothers or you know we start to seethings happening in the world around usthat that we don't like right we startto feel like what will happen to theplanet we live on whether it be Warwhere I live will my children be saferight there's so much that we need toprotect ourselves again so thatvulnerable part of of us right the partof the iceberg sticking out above thewater needs a defensive structure aroundit to protect it against thevulnerability of fear confusion despairright and because the conscious mind isis sticking out of the water with adefensive structure around it right itis the the raw material from which wecreate our character structure so thecharacter structure is all of that thepart under the water the part above thewater the defensive structure so imaginelike a nest around all of that andthat's the character structure that weutilize to interface with the worldright so the character structure is it'slike the thing that I'm using right it'slike if you're driving somewhere in acar right the car is the thing thatyou're using to go there right thecharacter structure is the thing thatwe're using to interface with the worldso for example how trusting am I versussuspicious right how readily do I cometo make friends with people right how uhhow much do I act out if I'm frustratedright how much do Ium you know exclaim something negativeright as opposed to holding it inside ofme how much do I rationalize ifsomething isn't going well do I want tolook at it and maybe see that it is sothat I don't have to face it right howmuch do I avoid problems in the worldaround me how much do I exercisealtruism right these are all the ways inwhich we're engaging with the worldaround us and this determines the selfimagine that the self then grows out ofthis now Nest from the the characterstructure that we use to interface withthe world and the decisions that we makeso if our character structure is is thething through which we engage with theworld then we're enacting right what isinside of us right what we've determinedthrough our unconscious mind ourconscious mind our defense mechanismthere's a certain us that that comes atthe world in a certain way and if we'remore or less trusting more or lessavoidant we rationalize more or lessthese are the factors that determinelike where do our lives go right becauseon top of all of this imagine that thenest of the character structure aroundall of this grows from it the self rightthe product of the feelings inside thethings that we know about ourselves anddon't know about ourselves the decisionsthat all of it leads to so I may chooseto be for example more trusting and thatmay bring an opportunity to me that Iwouldn't have otherwise had right I maychoose to be more trusting and and itmay bring risk to me that I wouldn'totherwise have had so we want to be ashealthy as we can as knowledgeable ofourselves in the world around us so thatit's safe for us to have a healthycharacter structure through which we canengage in the world around us with asense of prudence right takingreasonable risks right not too little sothat we shut ourselves down and maybeend up despairing not so much that thatscary things can happen to us and we endup fearful right but the idea that if weknow ourselves well the characterstructure is healthy right because it'sbuilt upon a structure of self and afunction of self that are healthy andout of it is coming empowerment rightand empowerment and humility right thatthen lead us to agency and gratituderight the idea here is that this is thecharacter structure that we create thatcan then interface with the world in away that's good for us and good for theworld around us that leads us to to beable to live in much more Harmony insideof ourselves and outside of ourselvesso if I understand correctly defensemechanisms that grow up out of this"

they'resuper nice the person's a jerk they'relike weird you know etc etcI think very few of us are familiar withassessing our own character structureright right and I have to presume thatsome of what happens when somebody comesto you as a psychiatrist or to apsychologist is that certain questionsare asked and certain narratives aretold that start to reveal to theclinician the character structure andperhaps from there some of the possibledefense mechanisms and uh you knowstructure of the person's unconsciousmind and conscious mind that obviouslyare unaware to them but would be cleardifferent clinicianmuch in the same way that if somebodygoes into the doctor and says you know Idon't feel well they can start probingwith questions or are they going to putyou know take a take a re listen totheir breathing right into their heartright I mean you could help thestethoscope and figure it out these arethe probes whereas the psychiatrist thepsychologist uses words and language toprobe yes sowhat are the sorts of aspects ofcharacter structure that we can be awareof in ourselves you know I mean in otherwords should we be asking what type ofcharacter do I have depending on onecircumstance or anotherum should we ask ourselves what sorts ofdefenses we have and maybe this would bea good opportunity to um address thisissue of what are healthy versusunhealthy defenses because it sounds tome if I understand correctly that thedefense mechanisms are a very strongcomponent in determining what ourcharacter structure is right because thedefense mechanisms are unconscious rightthe character structure that Nest aroundthe defenses and the conscious mindthrough which we interface with theworld right is very very complicated sothere is many character structures asthere are human beings right so it'svery very complicated but there arefactors that are consistently relevantacross people and get identified as suchso so one example would be isolationversus affiliation right so does aperson tend to group with others rightor does the person tend to avoidgrouping right and and go about uhthoughts tasks approaches to life in ina more a singular manner right so it'sjust one element not making valuejudgment about it because it can be goodor bad on either end of the spectrumright so we're just saying what are thefactors so am I more affiliative or do Itend to isolate and be more singularthat's just one example right anotherexample could be things like for exampleuse of humor right does a person usehumor and in what way right does aperson use humor to deflect uhdiscomfort in negative situations does aperson use humor in order to belittleothers or to belittle themselves or doesa person not use humor right so theseaspects of character structure and somuch research has been done on this overthe years to determine what is mostSalient right in this this thing that weuse in order to interface with the worldaround us out of which grows our selfthat makes good sense and and it makesme want to revise a little bit what Iasked about before which is I said thatwhen it comes to an exam of physicalhealth we measure blood pressure measureum breathing Etc maybe even a blood testlook at some biomarkers but what you'redescribing is a little bit moreanalogous to The Physician uh addressinga patient who's having some physicaldiscomfort or malaise and saying tell meabout your day you know what do you dowhen you get up in the morning if theperson says well you know I I drink ayou know a quarter pint of Vodka it's avery different answer than you know I'dgo outside and get sunlight in my eyesdrink a glass of water and maybe have acup of coffee right right you knowum or if somebody says I have sixespresso if I understand correctly thecharacter structure is better revealedbyexploring the action Statesisolation versus engagementum as opposed to a read of one specificbiomarker yes um characteristicstructure brought to liferight yesimmediately I'm thinking about moviesand books where we learn so much aboutsomebodythrough observing the way that theyinteract with people in in very um verypotent ways so for instance I can thinkof countless movies where you learn aton about somebody in the first scenesimply because of the way they react tosomebody who you know Cuts them off onin traffic they just explode okay wellthen we think of that person as reactivefrom that point on unless there's asignificant amount of material to revisethat but it's in the action of ofgetting explosive and cursing Etc asopposed to if they just kind of laugh itoff or laugh at themselves or blamesomeone within their own vehicle orsomething like that so is are those thesorts of things that a clinician likeyourself is listening for when somebodysays you know I don't feel well and yousay well tell me about what's going onlately and they start describing what'sgoing on in their life and are youlistening for those places where the thedefense mechanisms can are start startto reveal themselves the characterstructure starts to reveal itselfthrough these action steps that theperson seems to be taking is that yeahyeah I mean maybe one way of looking atcharacter structure is that it's it'spotentialities and positions right thatthere's so much that that's latent thatthen interfaces with events like aperson stuck in traffic how does thatperson respond if that person weren'tstuck in traffic there wouldn't be aresponse to it right so so there arepotentialities their predispositions andthen we live through enacting them aswe're moving then through life right andthe the attempts to understand so usingthe physical health parallel right ifyou came in and you said I don't feelwell right you know we might run a lotof tests right we might get an MRI or aCAT scan or even put in the stethoscopeand listening to us inside of you thosewe can say are unconscious things likeyou know you're not aware of what theImaging may show or the blood test mayshow or how your lungs may sound whensomeone puts a stethoscope on them rightso so a clinician if you're trying tounderstand and help someone then you dowant to look for those things right youwant to look for the things that areunderneath the surface but that that canbe very very important right you alsowant to look at everything that's on thesurface right so if you're if you'reengaging with someone you're engagingwith the self right the self that growsout of the character structure Nestright so by engaging with and and doingone's best to understand the self thenyou learn about what is underneath of itright so I may then learn well how doyou respond in certain situations rightjust like I could ask you questions orwell when do you not feel well right soyou're asking a person questions becausethe idea is to understand elements ofthe character structure so how do yourespond in certain situations what'sgoing on inside of you right what do youunderstand about yourself and what doyou not understand about yourself righthow do you bring yourself to bear in theworld around you so there's a similarprocess going on but here we're tryingto understand the self and theunderstanding of the self can help usunderstand the components underneath ofthe self because that's where we'regoing to go to make things better rightthe idea is there shouldn't have to beMiss history or certainly not mysteryany more than there is in physicalhealth I mean you know rarely someonecomes in and they're really not feelingwell and and a whole set of everythingthat should be done is done right Labsphysical examination history Imagingright and and you still just don't knowright I mean sometimes that can happenbut it's very rare and the same shouldapply here that if we're examining aself right and we're looking for thecomponents out of which that self comesright then we should be able tounderstand well enough to go back to thecomponents of self and to make change sothat the self is in a better place rightand and that self can then be empoweredcan feel humility right can then come atlife through the altruism and gratitudethat we see because again you show mesomeone who's coming at life throughaltruism and gratitude and is not happywith their life and you'll be showing mesomething I've never seen beforesomething entirely new so if we want toget there we want to know how to getthere and there are ways as there shouldbe that parallel physical health thataren't mysterious that we can come at tomake understanding and changeI'm wondering about the role of anxietyin all of

            "text": "the reason I ask about anxiety is thatyou said that so much of characterstructure is determined by a set ofpredispositions and potentialitiesand earlier we were talking aboutexample of either being afraid orunafraid in particular environments orfeeling like we can walk into aclassroom and learn or whether or notwe're overly concerned about what peoplethink about us or both right it could bea mixwhether or not we can Embrace novelenvironments in safe and adaptive wayswhether or not we can grow from themas opposed to whether or not we can beovertaken by them or perhaps eveninjured harm psychologically physicallyor bothanxiety to me is is a very basicfunction I think about it in terms ofthe autonomic nervous system and degreesof excitability andEtc and ability to sleep at night andability to wake up feeling reasonablygood but not have a panic attack butanxiety to me does seem like a key nodein all of this meaningyou know most people including myselfI don't walk around thinking about mycharacter structure I don't walk aroundthinking about how I'm going to behavein a bunch of hypothetical environmentsthink about the fact thatmost mornings I wake up and I feelpretty good to be quite honest not asgood as I would like to feel and thenabsolutely because anything's wrong butbecause I think I'm wired to be a littlebit more on the anxious side and topredict what's going to happen next andwhat needs to be done and so until I'mactually engaging in certain behaviorsthat anxiety hums a little bit high forme the gears turn a little bit fasterperhaps than I would like when I wake upin the morning but once I engage I feellike that the speed of that gear turningmatches the demands of Life pretty wellI feel um agency okayumso if you don't mind could we explorethis this feeling of anxiety or lack ofanxiety that I think people are prettyfamiliar with within themselves atdifferent times of day and underdifferent conditions because to me itseems like itum an interesting lens to to explorethis notion of character structure anddefenses is anxiety a healthy defense oran unhealthy defense or does it simplydepend on the circumstanceswell we all have some degree of anxietyin us right we all have some awarenessthat like we're navigating the world andlike not everything is is perfect rightthis is not Nirvana so there's someanxiety within us and the thought isthat that anxiety can keep us Vigilantabout the things we should be vigilantabout you know health and safety rightbut that too much anxiety Then becomescounterproductive and we can look atthis in a very regimented way right soso some anxiety makes sense right itkeeps us being careful it keeps youbecause you're being careful as you'repulling out of a driveway for examplesample right so okay it can be it can beabsolutely fine but let's say you bringsomething to clinical attention thatisn't absolutely fine right let's say Ididn't know you and you come in we havethe example that that we that you usedbefore where where you you walk intowork and there's a group of people thatyou that you know well and like rightlet's say you told me when I walk inthere I I feel very anxious right Idon't feel like things are okay right sothen we would go through we said that'snot good right maybe it's impacting yourprofessional life things are not goingwell like you really want this to changebecause it's impacting your life in anegative way and we say okay let's lookat that from the perspective ofstructure of self right so firstunconscious right is it that justgenetically are you built with justhigher levels of anxiety right so wecould learn okay have you always beenanxious like this is has this alwaysbeen in your life since you were alittle kid no matter what so we'relooking for biological nature so tospeak variables we might also look forthings that that have happened to youthat are lodged in your unconscious mindright is there trauma that you haven'tprocessed right that now is underneaththe surface but is spinning off moreanxiety right let's say you tell me ohit wasn't that long ago you startedbeing anxious ah like did somethinghappen like did you walk into a group ofpeople and I don't know you tripped andyou felt bad about something right andthen then you get more anxious right soare there things going on underneath thesurface that are impacting you likelet's let's look into that right becausethat's the biggest part of the icebergright then your conscious mind we couldstart thinking about okay what what'sgoing on what are you actively thinkingabout right so this is where sometimescognitive behavioral techniques can cancome into mind like are you thinkinglike oh no I'm scared it isn't going togo well right like are you havingthoughts or the thoughts and making youmore anxious right what's going on inyour conscious mind right I would alsobe very interested in the defensesaround you so for example do you tend toavoid right has this been getting worsefor three months but but you just yourmind wouldn't acknowledge it right andby the time you have to acknowledge itnow it's really bad right or do you notavoid and like this started just startedhappening and you want to nip it in thebud right so I would be interested inthe defense mechanisms right that aregirding your conscious self and I wouldbe interested in the character structurewhat decisions are you then making likeare you going anyway right are youhaving trouble so sometimes you avoidare you then making decisions that makeyou late and that causes problems howdoes it impact you once you're there areyou engaging differently with peopledoing your work differently so I want tounderstand the character structure andultimately you understand all of this byprobing the self that's riding along ontop of it and then what is theexperience of that self like do you seethat okay this is a problem and I wantto address it but like look I know thatI'm good at what I do and you know Imean this isn't some like awful thingabout me I just have to deal with itright or is yourself impacted when youstart thinking maybe I can't do thisanymore I'm not good enough or you knowwe want to understand what's theexperience of the self right and if wedo all of that how is it that we don'tget to a place where we can understandthat anxiety right and we can makethings better so just like in physicalhealth okay maybe we can't but that is adramatic outlier if we bring ourselvesto Bear we would say you should not haveto have this in you right because it issomething negative it is makingunhappiness for you it is taking awayfrom empowerment right and it's alsotaking away from humility right becauseif someone's beating up on themselvesyou're beating up on yourself about itthen that's not humility right then thatthat's being sort of falsely persecutoryright this is not an honest humility tothat it leads us away from health soit's like we don't want it to be thisway right because that is workingagainst agency and gratitude so we canunderstand it and we can go after it andmake it betterone of the most common questions I geton the internet and I get a lot of"

is one reasonabledefinition of confidence our ability totrust our predispositions and ourpotentialities enough that were we toencounter scenarios a through zwe feel pretty good that we wouldrespond the right way in a way thatum wouldn't threaten our conscious mindat a core level right you know that wewouldn'tum I used to use the term and joke a lotin my laboratory uh with the the phraseyou know dissolve into a puddle of ourown tears right it's kind of this likehyperbolic explanation of of what Ithink many people fear like they'regoing to be called upon to answer aquestion publicly or give a speech orthey're gonna be at a critical moment ina relationship or something and they'reand just everything is just going to goso badly wrong that it's just gonnadissolve them as a person it'simpossible right dissolving a bottle ofour own tears is impossible but I thinkthat's a fear that a lot of people livewith because we can get into this alittle bit later and we will I'm sureyou know this notion of like protectingone's ego is it seems really vital tobeing a human being some level like wedon't we don't want to dissolve into apuddle of our own tears so is confidencethe ability to trust ourselves in abunch of different contextsand at the same time I I do have toraise the this notion of narcissism Ithink um uh you know this word getsthrown around a lot lately but it seemsto me that anyum truly psychologically healthy personwould also not want to be the idiot thatthinks that they're better than theyactually are that's aum what are your thoughts on this well Iagree with the things that you that yousaid about confidence except I would addtwo factors that I think are like reallybig big factors right right one beingState dependence and the other beingphenomenology right so think about thestate dependence first right when we'retalking about confidence it's it's notuniform right or it's not automaticallyuniform right so if so if you were totell me oh I lack confidence right thenI want to understand is that across theboard is like is that a way that youfeel about yourself that like I I'm notgood enough at anything for examplesimple right or do you lack confidencein a specific area right and this isoften the case right and it's a hugedifference right it says that person hasthe Machinery of confidence so to speakright they have the potentialities andthe predispositions for confidence rightwhen that character structure that'sself-built upon it is in engaging withthe world right but they're not able tobring it to bear in certain in a certainspecial situation so to speak so forsome people for example the way we mostoften see this is like the carve out ofromance right where because it's soemotionally Laden right and likerejection can feel so bad right that wecan see people who are very confident inmany many aspects of life but they arevery diffident about romance and they'llsay different oh it never works out forme or no one will ever like me right andand you see like that's not how thatperson actually feels right aboutthemselves as a whole human being rightwhich which is then we are coming at howto make that better in a way that's veryrobust right we might say something likehey here's the good news is you have thetools and the Machinery that you needright you're confident in so many waysright in fact maybe in all ways exceptthis one so let's go take a look at likewhy is that specialright and then and that where are wewe're back to is it something in theunconscious mind is it is something inthe in the conscious mind about how thatperson is engaging right so we we haveto understand what the state is and ifthe lack of confidence is Statedependent if the person is not confidentacross the board then again we go backto the same we always go back to thesame places to look right but then youmight more think okay is there an impactof childhood trauma or early life traumathat that took away from that person youknow their ability to to gain confidenceright because if you have no confidenceacross the board there's a deeperproblem right because there would besomething anyone can be good about andfeel confident in right so the statedependence is very important as isphenomenology so what is your experienceof being confident if you tell mewell I'm let's say in a differentversion of this example you say you knowactually I'm quite I feel quiteconfident when I when I walk into a roomof of people I say okay I want tounderstand more about that too rightbecause if I ask questions about thatand you say well I feel confidentbecause you know look I'm I'm a prettysmart person I can think on my feet Ican I can deal well with with people ifsomething doesn't go right I can recoverfrom it like I've got you know it's whyI feel confident you know and say okaythat sounds pretty good if you say wellI feel confident because I know that I'mbetter than everybody right now we havea problem right right like that's notgoing to go well in other you know inother uh aspects of life and engagementlike this you know it's not going tolead to humility and gratitude like soso where's that coming from and againmaybe there's a deeper problem right asyou say about narcissism right which canbe a a reaction right which is areaction to vulnerability right so thenthere's was a reaction information andnow the person is actually deeplydiffident right but presents is veryvery confident and with a sense ofsuperiority and that that's not a recipefor for happiness right so so in the inapproaching it we we do want tounderstand all the things that you saidwhat are the factors and the the set ofpredispositions and the set ofpotentialities but then what's the realworld experience of that acrosssituations and what is the person'sexperience of that inside which is whyif we're going to understand and helppeople like that's the understand partright you know it's why the conveyorbelt medicine you know it doesn't workright in situations where we're dealingwith human beings like mental healthright we have to understand somethingabout people to understand whateverthey're telling us means otherwise

thescript in my head how do I typicallyit's how do I shut down a particularnarrative in my head it seems to fitvery well in thinking about structure ofself because as you pointed out you knowthe the self or the structure of selfincludes the unconscious mind you knowwhat's going on below the surface of thewater in this Iceberg model what's goingon in the conscious mind that theconscious mind is protected by thesedefense mechanisms that grow up from theunconscious mindfrom that comes a character structureand then this thing that we call theself right right but when it comes tobeliefs and internal narratives thoseseem to me things that people are prettywell aware of in fact the very examplethat people are asking me this all thetime how to change beliefs internalnarratives means they are aware of themit also suggests thatfor many people out there their beliefsabout themselves and their internalnarratives are not healthy or at leastthey don't feel are serving them well orthat they are intrusiveI don't know how open people are abouttheir beliefs and internal narrativeswhen they come to you in the in yourclinical practice butum if you could tell us a little bitabout beliefs and internal narrativesand uh whether or not they are importantto rewire and and resetthis part is extremely important rightso imagine for example that I'm sayingto myself over and over again that I'm aloser right or I'm not good enough rightI mean imagine trying to go through lifeand someone else we're saying that toyou all the time right I mean it's worsewhen it's inside your own head right sowhat's going on inside of us ourinternal dialogue our internalnarratives are extremely important andhere's where we run into a very bigproblem is that we live in an era and ina culture that is very attuned to Rapidgratification right and all of this thatwe're talking about can change but itdoes not change quickly and it's amazingto me me when you know you'll see underInsurance paradigms often right nomatter what's going on with someone theyhave 10 sessions of cognitive behavioraltreatment right if there's somethinglike we're trying to change beliefs it'sa guarantee of failure right becausebeliefs don't change that fast right soimagine for example that we you know youand I chose a word a random word and wedecided to say it 500 times right we'deach be saying it tonight right it's notgoing to be out of our minds by tonightbut because we what took a random wordand said it 500 times right so imaginethat there's something that's highlyemotionally Laden and we've said itthousands and thousands and thousands oftimes right that's not going to go awayquickly right but it can go away andduring the process of it atrophyingright our lives can get better rightthis is the opposite of hopeless rightit's actually very very encouraging butin a world that's rapid gratificationright like how do we fix this how do wefix this now that doesn't acknowledgethis we hear all the time that a personhas failed therapy right like this issaid all the time that person failed itwhat does failed therapy mean right Imean I think therapy failed that personright but we we label like oh a personisn't better right but there are thingsgoing on inside of us that could takemonths and months or years to makebetter now again that's okay if we'reaware of what's going on just the veryfact that we understand and we're makingchange right it helps us feel betterabout ourselves and more confident rightthat we can change all of this but wehave to approach it in the right way solet's say that I'm telling myself overand over againum you're not going to get there rightand let's say a place I want to goprofessionally right or no one's evergoing to really want you right if if I'mlooking for a romantic partner right soso imagine these things are going on andthey're going on over and over again andyou can imagine now that it's intrudedinto the unconscious mind it's going onin my conscious mind my defensivestructure is Shifting in negative waysI'm becoming more avoidant like nothingabout this is good and I want it tochange and I wanted to change tosomething that says like you can do itright or you're lovable right or you canbe a good partner to someone so I wantto change it right so imagine now when Istart to make that change I'm blazing apath right and and I'm blazing a pathwhere there wasn't a path before rightand I can blaze a path and I can gothrough that path but that path is goingto be nothing like maybe the four-lanehighway right adjacent to me where thething that I've been telling myself foryears and years and years born of traumaright is is you know is going back andforth right I mean it's got a four-lanehighway I'm cutting a path right butover time you cut that path more andmore you tread that path more and moreyou take energy towards that path itbecomes better now let's imagine likethe path is well lit and it's 12 feetwide and maybe we can pave the path somore more traffic so to speak goes downit and we're taking energy away fromthat four-lane Highway and maybe itstarts to be overgrown a little bit andthere are cracks in the road like we canchange all of that but we have tounderstand what's going on and andidentify it like what is going on insideof me uh what do I make of it right howdo I understand the process of changehow do I increase my empowerment duringthe process of change if we come at itthe right way all of this can be changedit's not hardwired in us it's just veryvery strongly reinforced the same wayour brains are

going on in thatperson's mind it's addressablebut you don't know what it is and how toaddress it until we ask the question ofwhat's going on inside right so if he'safraid that he's going to gain all thatweight back right and he has a historythat if significant negative thingshappen he throws self-care to the windright then we'd come at it through thatpattern right because he would have avery you know he'd have a good reason tobe worried right because of this patternof something bad happens and I can't Idon't take care of myself for six monthsyou know maybe someone I'm just makingthis up and maybe someone in his life isill or he's fearing a death you know andif it's just something that would saythat's a very legitimate fear to havelike let's let's talk about that likelet's look at where that comes fromright what got that person into thatpattern in the first place right byunderstanding the pattern and by workingtogether right can we can we Stave thatoff right but it could be different theperson might say well I'm really I'mhaving a lot of food cravings right andwe be like okay what does that meanwhere's that coming from or maybe he'sdepressed and when and he's gettingdepressed and when he's depressed hecan't stop eating more right so you knowyou would look or it might just be plainold fear like this is so good right thatthat I'm worried it will go away rightthen we might want

I'm not feeling good thedoctor better not do the same thingsright it says how are you not feelinggood okay let me understand that andthen let me map that also to youwhatever underlying state of health youmay have or diagnosis you may have thesame is true in mental health if we justapply that then it's remarkable the goodthat we do which I've seen veryconsistently across 20 years of doingthis not only in my own practice butlike who are the people who do reallyreally well trying to understand andtake care of people including sometimesnot doing too much and realizing likehey this person is okay like there's astate of health here but this person isworried how do we reassure them righthow do we help someone living a goodlife live a better life right if we'regoing to do all of this we have toapproach people as individuals it's justI mean the science tells us that andCommon Sense tells us that too but if wedo that that a person can get to theplace they want to be I'd like toaddress a different person as an example"

Etc but you know atsome levelwhy not just do what needs to be done inlife like the people that don't want toexplore the self you know because to meit seems so absolutely clear that justas it's important to have a certainlevel of endurance strength flexibilityso that one can extract the most joy andagency and gratitude and empowerment andhumility from lifethat it makes sense to explore the selfto ask you know where am I internallystrong where am I internally weak youknow where might I perceive myself asstrong where as I'm actually weak rightthese seems like these seem like veryimportant if not crucial questions toask but I know that there are certainnumber of people in the world thinkall of that is just kind of a waste oftime right it's all about doing stuffit's all you know why explore the selfyou know and um I thinkthe rest of us are looking at thatperson often and thinking well you'reexactly the kind of person that needs todo this because of the ways that yougrate on other people but but not alwaysright sometimes these people just appearto be just very effective they're allabout the outward expression of whatthey're doing and I certainly don't knowhow other people feel waking up in themorning and going to sleep at night andthroughout the day but to the personthatfeels like introspection and exploringmaybe even Excavating for trauma thatthey haven't been in touch with orhaven't dealt with yet but the personthat feels that all of that isit's kind of not really worth the effortand that's all about action you knowwhat can we say to that person or thosepeopleput differently does one need to changeand need to believe in the power ofthese sorts of approachesin order for them to work uh we oftenhear that people don't change until theywant to change and um and could we alsosay perhaps that even for the peoplethat feel like they're functioningextremely well in all domains of life Iknow no such people and I know some veryhigh achieving people as you do too Iknow no such people uh the only peoplewho seem to exist in that sphere are theNars the clear narcissists that to themjust seem like they're doing great buteveryone else can't stand them by theway narcissists no one else can standyouumwhat do we say to to those individualsbecause I think it's a big swath ofhumanity and I think it um it accountsfor a lot of suffering in the worldincluding their own suffering yeah so Iwould make an appeal to common senseright so imagine you take someone whodoesn't know anything about health theydon't know they don't know how toexercise don't know how to eat well theyjust don't know and they're very reallyunhealthy right they're overweight theyhave low energy they have sleep apneathey don't need to have any and and andyou why not just say to them well likejust go be differentlike in fact be different nowwhy aren't you different right now rightlikeof course we would never do that becauseit's a it's absurd oh and by the way italso would be cruel right so it's absurdand it's cruel so we would never do thatright let's say now you let's say wefast forward some period of months saymake it up right and we see that personand wow they are much healthier theyhave much more energy they've lostweight they're physically fita lot will have gone on in between thosetwo snapshots of that person that personhas to learn a lot right how does onetake care of oneself right then morespecifically how do I take care ofmyself right what healthy foods you knowwill I like what healthy foods will Iwill I eat how will I put that on thetable what kind of exercises can workfor me how will they work for me how doI strengthen muscle how do I strengthenthe heart how do I increase lungcapacity right there's learning there'sdiligenceum you know there's stick-to-itivenessright there's resilience that's how theperson gets there right it is nodifferent and it's mental health rightif we say wow you feel you feeldiffident across the board or you feelSuperior across the board or whatever itis like life isn't going well and youdon't have things you want and you knowthe self-talk is negative and we saywell look what just be different rightnow right I mean it's remarkable thatpeople will say that at times not justin a way that'sdenigrating an awful for others but tothemselves too right I mean I hearpeople say this most often to themselveslike why am I not just different right Iwant to be different or what's wrongwith me that I'm not and and like yeahit's like everything else like you haveto apply understanding and work andeffort like the good news is you can getto whatever change you want I mean aperson can get to whatever reasonablechangethat person wants like you know I'm 54years old I'm not going to climb MountEverest I'm not a mountain climber rightbut if I want to like I want to run toclimb some mountains I want to get outthere and do some things I can go dothat right the same thing is true withour mental health goals but not at thesnap of a finger not by Magic right it'sthrough applying the same science andCommon Sense a combination of Scienceand common sense that we apply to otherthings that's why we go through thisprocedure of unconscious mind consciousmind the structure and function of theself because that's how that's how it'sdone that's how the after snapshot looksdifferent than the before fundamentalHealth perspective as wellthat's very helpful and I think it'sgoing to be very helpful to a lot ofpeople in thinking about what to thinkabout what sorts of questions should toaddress maybe even whether or not to gettherapy and hopefully we'll remap theirNotions of therapy I mean of course thiscritically relies on the therapist beinggood to excellentum and I think in the previousum sit down we had around the uh in theepisode on trauma specifically youmapped out a number of the features ofquality therapy so we can refer peopleto that if they're thinking about it'stime stamped in that episode you knowwhat to look for in a therapist what howto assess whether or not it's going wellor not whether or not to move on or orstay put with that therapist and so on"

thefunction of self I realize it's beenwoven in here or there yesumcould you tell us about the function ofself the functions of self verb actionsI mean are these things that we are alldoing right now that reflect ourcharacter structureare these things that um we can changemore readily than trying to snap ourfingers and say okay I'm now going to bea more altruistic person because I candecide that right now but thenultimately I have to engage in somealtruistic behaviorsto to lend support to that again samewith the parallel that I can't just snapmy fingers and say lower blood pressureyou know I have to do some meditativepractices some cardiovascular trainingand things of that sort uh what what isthis function of self thing what goesinto the functions of self okay so sojust stepping back to the framing rightso there's these two pillars upon whichwe build our lives the structure of selfand the function of self and we've beentalking as you said more about thestructure which is more the nouns of itlike there is an unconscious what is inthat unconscious for example there aredefense mechanisms uh uh how are weusing them like it's not all nouns butit's more what are those things and thenwe start talking about how we put theminto practice the function of self ismuch more the verbs right so if thestructure is more nouns the function ismore the verbs right the actualengagement right so so that would startwith an awareness of I so a function ofself has to start with an awareness likethere's a person there isn't there is ame that is separate from others rightand I have responsibility for this eyeright like it is me no one else isguiding it like it's me I know there's ameokay then on top of that we start seeingdefense mechanisms in action rightbecause we're thinking about functionright we're aware that there's an eyebut the first thing that startshappening to that eye are unconsciousthings right so the defense mechanismsbecause we're not choosing them rightthey start doing things automatically soif for example I have a defense ofavoidance right then I'm not thinkingyou know if it's I'd like to meet a newperson but I automatically am shyingaway right then that's not it's not goodright it's a factor right but it's afactor I'm not aware of until I startthis process of introspecting right sothe defense mechanisms are then kind ofdetermining the lay of the land right soin that example I'm sorry to interruptbut it yeah it's starting to interruptbut in that exampleum the the Turning Away you describe asreflexive so you're talking aboutsomeone perhaps who would like to have aromantic partner or meet somebodyhave a companion and they go to thegrocery store and somebody sayssomething as they're reaching for themilk and you know there's that moment ofopportunity where they could saysomething back but instead they justkind of go oh yeah thanks and then theythey kind of move away and then they thenarrative in their head might be oh goshthat that was silly or but they don'treally think about the the alternatepossibility or there might be nonarrativethey had off to the produce section andthen they go home and and someone saysoh did anything happen if they're goodyou mean he went to the grocery store noright because it's all unconscious rightokay right now again we can can weexplore that and change that yes rightbut it's important to understand thatwhatever that nest of defense mechanismsis like that's what I've got right nowright and I'm living through that rightnow right that's it's performing afunction right just because it's anunconscious function does it mean it'snot a very very important function I cansee in that example how it protects theconscious mind from risk because there'salways the possibility of rejectionthere's a possibility of overinterpretation of what the other personis talking to them for right like is theperson interested in them or whether ornot this is just you know friendlybanterum the sort that anyone would have nextto anybody that is not special to themso I can see how the the uh theunconscious turning away is protectiveagainst all the negative possibilitiesand in some sense is pretty rationalbecause the the probability that thatone interaction could ratchet up to a alife of companionship and and romancewith somebody is in uh exceedingly smallreally although you could imagine a setof data points where you string togetheryou know like five second Clips you knowall like the time something like thathas happened right so maybe this is aperson that you know intermittently likepeople are interested in them or sayinghey they're saying hello or showinginterest you could string all thosetogether and the person hasn't noticedone of them right and then could have avery negative C nobody no one wants meno one's interested in me or whateverthe person is saying but but like it'sdifferent if you see from the outsidelike it's objectively different but thatperson doesn't know and that's why afterbeing an awareness there is an eye thenext thing that I think of in the in thefunction of self is is the defensemechanisms in actionwhat are some other examples of defensemechanisms in action because I think"

            "text": "there's immense interest in this youknow the idea that we haveunconscious processes in us that arereaching up out of the iceberg andpreventing us from seeing our life andourselves the way that it actually isoccurring and perhaps preventing us fromachieving these ideals of agency andgratitude empowerment and humility youknow I mean these seem like verypowerful and important forces and and Iand I know many other people out therewant to understand whether or notwhat we're doing and what we're feelingand experiencing whether or not that isserving us well or not so I think thethe place to start is to say thatthere's something very very complicatedgoing on right the the part of theiceberg underneath the surface rightthat biological supercomputer that'srunning at a million thoughts and amillion actions and a million internalprocesses a second right is constantlyshifting our defensive structure so soit's complicated and you can almostimagine that like one leaves and anothercomes in and they're shifting andthere's a little bit of one and some ofanother like so it's a very complicatedprocess but we can look at it andunderstand so so an example of a defensemechanism that's very common and cancause us a lot of problems is projectionright so give two examples of ofprojection so so one is the experienceof sitting in a car right and beingstuck in traffic being a little bit lateright and feeling beleaguered right Imean this has happened to me more timesthan I can count but at some point Istarted through my own therapy lookingat like what's going on in me right whenI'm doing this right so the thing aboutthe be feeling beleaguered right as ifwhat does that mean like there'ssomething called traffic that exists andhas a mind and wants to thwart me rightis it individual cars is it the peoplein the cars right what's going on isthat I'm having a perception ofhostility I feel beleaguered right butit's it's anger and frustration insideof me right I'm I'm the one feelingangry and frustrated there's there'sthere's no one and nothing but me that'sfeeling anything about this right but Ihave this sense of the world around mebeing hostile because I'm projecting myanger outward right now I think thisisn't good because instead of sitting intraffic and saying look maybe it totallymakes sense that I'm stuck in trafficand that I'm not happy like maybe I Ishould leave a little bit earlier and Iwouldn't be late or if I'm going to workshould I live closer to work I couldmake a whole set of decisions that I'mnot making right or maybe I know Ithought it was going to be a 15 minutedrive and like it was an accident rightand okay there are things that I can'tcontrol I'm not supposed to controleverything right if you think about whatcan I control being aware of that andwhat can I not control right then it canmake the situation much better so thisdoesn't happen with this frequency andit also takes away the anger and thefrustration right so I I think that's agood example because it it happens a lotit's very very common but projectionthen also happens with people right solet's say you and I work together andwe're we're going to do somethingcollaborative together andI'm just not having a good day andsomething negative happened before Icame to work and you know I'm not at mybest and I'm a little bit I'm a littlebit irritable and frustrated right thishappens all the time where then theperson sits down with someone and thenI'm being irritable and frustrated whichdoesn't feel good to you right and andyou may become irritable and frustratedright and then I say oh look he'sirritable and frustrated right but evenif you don't the fact that I feel thatway right that projection often wouldlead me to think that it's you who'sthat way here I come wanting to do thisjob and you're not at your best it's mewho's not at my best right but we dothis all the time and then we makeincorrect or inaccurate attributionsright so so projection is an example ofa defense mechanism that can cause us alot oftrouble right a lot of trouble anothercan be displacement where if I'm feelinganger or frustration say in a certainrealm then I the idea of feeling it atwork and then kicking the dog right likeit's not good that we do that we're notacknowledging what's going on inside ofus at work what we could change what wecould make better and the dog doesn'twant to be kicked right and the dog isoften you know also the family right andit could be physical or could be throughwords right but the idea that with thatthere's something negative beinggenerated in us but but inside we'rewe're perceiving that it's coming fromsomewhere else right I mean the thoughtis all things to lead us astray rightwhen they're negative defenses rightthere can be positive defenses too suchas altruism right that that someonecould do something negative to me rightand instead of me passing that along Icould decide no I'm going to dosomething I'm going to do something nicefor the next person I have anopportunity to do something nice forright like that's a defense andsometimes we could think of it anddecide that way but they're people whoreact that way like there's somethingnegative that happens and they respondwith something that's that's differentfrom that so defense mechanisms can workagainst us they can work for us they'recomplicated they're combinations of thembut we can look inside and say forexample if I'm using projection all thetime right and I think everyone aroundme is kind of always angry andfrustrated right and there's always badtraffic right but then as we start totalk about it more it becomes apparentthat there's a lot I'm angry about rightbut I'm not aware of it then thenreflection or therapy right or a goodfriend we're talking to can help us seeright that hey this is going on insideof me right and that can really help ussame with use of humor like if I'm usinghumor and um I'm kind of decompressinguncomfortable situations or things thatmake me feel uncomfortable maybe thatgreases the wheels of social progressbut maybe over time I come to you humorin a way that's self-denegrating rightwell that's not so good anymore but Imay not be aware of the shift justbecause I could maybe be funny incertain situations that I'm now notusing that for myself anymore I'm usingit against myself and by talking topeople by reflection like we can beaware of the defensive structure that'sgoing on inside of us and then there'snot an automaticity to it if you pointout that I'm using projection a lot Ican start to be aware of that just likeif someone let's say you were with me atthe grocery store right and someone sayssomething nice and I shy away and yousay Hey you know you didn't weren't evenaware someone said hello to you and thenI said I want to be more aware of thatlike I want I don't want that thing tohappen unconsciously so maybe now Ithink okay anytime someone I don't knowsays something I'm going to just stopand think like what's going on hereright is that person being friendly tome is it is are they just you know it'sjust a person exchanging money the cashrate so like what's going on so we takewhat's on unconscious and we make itconscious so that we can change itsounds to me like exploring and thinkingabout our reflexes is what's really key"

same thinguse sarcasmas a form of humor and it can be veryfunny but I have to imagine based oneverything I'm hearing from you todaythat there's a form of sarcasm which isan unhealthy defense I'm thinking of theperson that no matter what someone elsesays that's positive or or no matterwhat someone does that could be viewedas positive they find some way todiminish it by like through sarcastichumor right I I see this a lot and Ithink closely nested with sarcasm iscynicismin fact I have a family member I won'tname who they are to protect the not soinnocent who used to be very cynicalum and I want to ask you what is thething about cynicism and they said wellI have had a particular genre of ofschooling growing up a formal schoolingwhere if anyone behaved um too happyexpressed too much happiness rathertoo much delight they were viewed asstupid like as if to be happy is to umto be unaware of of the sophisticationand the importance of things in liferightum and I hope that this is unrelatableto most people listening butum I do think that sarcasm is is adouble-edged blade in this sense andthat cynicism is is perhaps um adouble-edged blade as well but that itmight even be worse than sarcasm becauseit's a way of really reflecting backwhat'sby definition what's not good about lifewhat's not good about what's happeningand and it does seem protective right itprotects one from disappointment ifyou're already disappointed how couldyou be further disappointed it's alsoseems to me like a bit of a power moveit's like you're gonna be happy well I'mgonna take that away forever fromeverybody like as something that's likefor myself I meanum does any of this actually hold in theinside of the clinical literatureum because again I enjoy a goodsarcastic joke yeah in fact there's acollaboration around a sarcastic joke itcan be truly funny to everybody butum sarcasm and cynicismum I feel like are often used to cutdown what would otherwise beum benevolence or or bonding experiencesabsolutely like I grew up in central NewJersey humor is a weapon right or itcertainly can be right and people can bevery aggressive through humor so soacting out which is just letting ouraggression flow right that's a defenseright so just being aggressive andpushing someone back right however thatmeans like if I don't feel good aboutmyself I want you to feel not so goodabout yourself right is where we startgetting into into Envy right and humorcan be used that way so so that thatsort of biting sarcastic humor is a formof acting out it's a form of aggressionright it's not humor as a healthydefense right we can call it the samething but we could also call itdifferent things it's just a Nuance ofour language right if if humor can be adefense like I trip and fall I make alittle joke people are laughing at withme instead of at me right hey humor is agood defense I made myself feel bettermade things flow flow more easily but ifI'm using sarcastic humor to assailsomeone right then that's not it's notthat thing anymore right you know nowit's a manifestation of aggression rightand the idea that cynicism you know isis more then we're talking about a worldview right like sarcasm is somethingthat can be done now like we can make asarcastic joke funny or not then it'sover rightum but cynicism is is a way of coming atthe world there's a different kind ofDefense right the idea that hey it'slike the fox and the sour grapes like Idon't I I don't think there's anythinggood to be had anyway right so you can'ttake anything away from me can't make mefeel worse right I already feel uh veryvery bad about the world and abouteverybody in it and I'm protectingmyself that way like that's then anunhealthy defense because what does thatlead to at least isolation at least tomistrust you know we we know that peopleare happy if they live through altruismand gratitude and they're well connectedwith others so so the cynical point ofview which again to some degree being inthe world builds some sentence in usright like that that's okay that's partof that's a part of awareness in somesense but I think what you're talkingabout is a very pervasive cynicism thatthen is an unhealthy defense that isvery harmful to others like the ideathat I feel lousy about everything andif you don't I'm going to try and bringyou down right like too much happinesswe'll label that as something right wecould label it as stupid right so nowit's like it's not okay to be happierthan some sort of cynical Baseline rightand again there's nothing about altruismand gratitude like that's not happyright I mean who's happy in thatsituation cynical the people who areoverly cynical are not happy and thepeople around them are not happynobody's happythanks for the clarification on NewJersey a good portion of my biologicalfamily is from New Jersey come outwell-armed I I adore them but it's truethere was once a moment at a familygathering where somebody said uh let'sum let's hug or something and thereaction was like oh we're gonna hug nowyou know it was like it was it was itwas entirely sarcastic and cynical andlike in the the hug that resulted fromthat was this like little like likedistant past kind of thing it was andnow I'm laughing about it it's funny andand they're very loving people butyou're right it's a it's a differentstyle of humor

I'm about to ask you forinsight onyou know I've never allowed myself tostay in a bad professional situation forvery long you know when things didn'tfeel right or when I sensed someone Iwas working with or for wasn't the rightsituation I got out despite if I were toreally think about it that could havebeen pretty severe long-termconsequencesfortunately it all worked out in fact somuch so that I would sayum you know I pay attention to whetheror not people I work with and four areof the sort that I want to be workingwith and if I sense a particular type ofdanger I'll look at that and I I'm 100so far uh knock on wood but 100 so faron recognizing later that it was a greatdecision to move on and on the flip sideof it I've made I believe excellentdecisions in terms of who to work within terms of my podcasting in terms of myacademic career Etc but I've had to moveaway from people that just weren't rightfor me I don't think they were truly Badactors but thank goodness I moved awayand thank goodness I found these otherwonderful people to work withhowever there are circumstances thathave been repetitive in my life whereI'vejust be honest repeatedly made not gooddecisions about who to be involved withover fairly long periods of time andthere can even be an awareness or Ishould say there has been an awarenesslike this isn't a good situation and yetI'm persisting in in seeking out thisand similar types of situationsso I consider myself a at leastpartially rational human being with somedegree of introspectionyou know when I look at this and I thinkokay this is a choice to focus onplacing myself in I have to assume itplacing myself into situations that arechallenging for mein a way that I know is preventing mefrom living in certain ways that I wantand from being happy in certain waysthat I want when you hear a scenariolike that like I can do it over here butI can't seem to do it over here in factI see myself doing it the wrong way hereright a little bit different than theexample you gave a moment ago becausethe guy was driving to work notlistening to music but it wasn't puttingtwo and two together about what wasgoing on but when somebody can seewhat's going on I think this might evenbe called the repetition compulsion orsometimes yeah sometimes yeah what isthat about are people trying to work outsomething specific or are theydeliberately creating some friction toaccomplish something else right I mean Irealize this could be infinitely complexand again I'm not trying to extract umuh uh the clinical insight for for myown sake I started that clock on thatthank youum but I think a lot of people do thisthey do what they know they shouldn't bedoingthey know they shouldn't be doing it duhI just said that two ways and but theydo it like it must serve them in someway you know you think aboutum when you get a dog and you talk to adog trainer they say you know dogs dowhat worksright they get a reward for doingsomething they're going to continuedoing it uh you apply that to the samesort of thing I'm describing for myselfand that I've observed in other peopleand you must say it must work for themyou hear this in kind of pop psychologylike it must work for them like you mustbe solving somethingwhy the hell do I do this why do peopledo this is it real pathology or is it aroundabout way to get to something elsethat's actually pretty adaptive I meaninstead of defining it as pathology Iwould not Define it as pathology I wouldDefine it as humanness if humanness isnot in and of itself pathological thenall you're doing there is is describingsomething that is common widespreadacross human beings now it doesn't meanwe can't understand it and make ithealthier right I work in a disciplinethat wants to put a number on everythingright label it as something and then dosomething about it that's more oftenthan not ineffective right because we'renot looking at things in a top-down wayof what is Human Experience what are thenatural aspects of human experience thatare less than ideal right that we canthen understand and make better if wecome at it that way then we see ah thisis a great example because here's wherestructure meets function right so on thestructure side we said okay there'sdefense mechanism we imagine thebranches right that are coming up fromthe unconscious mind right and here itmeets function right defense mechanismsin action on the function side thendetermining salience so what I wouldimagine in your example my image is thatyour defensive structure when you'redoing the thing that's effective rightthe professional decisions right itlooks elegant right like there's Harmonyto where those branches are theConsciousness is sitting in between ityou can see you can see the Elegance toit right that I can just imagineshifting right when when you're notdoing the thing effectively rightbecause now you're using an entirelydifferent defensive structure which isgoing to function differently and createdifferent salience and I imagine thatit's convoluted and you know that it'ssort of piecemeal that it's notsomething elegant right so you say okaywhat does that actually mean let'stranslate it into what are the actualdefenses so let's think about whatyou're not doing when you're making gooddecisions in the professional realmright you are not using denial oravoidance or rationalization orprojection or projective identificationor acting out right there are all thesethings that you are not doing that arethe sort of unhealthy defenses beckoningto us like oh wouldn't it be easier toKick the Can down the road right youknow wouldn't it be easier to just likeno no everything's okay everything'sgoing to work out okay wouldn't it beeasier instead of being angry at oneperson who is really intrinsic to theenvironment if you you know it'sactually somebody else you know are youdisplacing it projecting that's howpeople that's what we get ourselves intotrouble right and if that's going onthen that set of defense mechanisms inactionright creates something that obscuresthe ability to make good judgment rightbut with none of those things going onthen what are you doing what you'reapplying your intelligence you'reapplying your discernment right you'reapplying your desire to make thingsbetter you're able to look at it you'reable to bring diligence perseveranceright you're able to bring healthyaspects of self to the question anddecide like oh I don't want this and itshould be different right and thereagain what's going on there's acomplexity under the surface but nowwe're coming up towards Simplicity rightwe're coming up towards the things thatare healthier that are simplistic if welook then okay what's going on if you'remaking the same mistakes over and overagain well we could you know we woulddive under the hood and really look andsay okay what are you doing there but ithas to be an array of unhealthy defensesthere's no other thing it could be so wewould say okay are you using a are youusing avoidance maybe a little maybe alot what about denial what aboutrationalization what about projectionlike you know you go through theunhealthy defenses and and you see whatis it that you're bringing to bear thatis leading you astray and then and thenof course the goal is to use the therole modeling and you role model foryourself how to be healthy right solet's take that role modeling and applyit to the thing you're sort of carvingout and and treating differently andthat's the reason when people talk aboutrepetition compulsions you know that'sit's not a formal term becausebecause what we're really talking aboutis repetition right and we're interestedlike why why do we repeat things nowthat's one that's one reason rightbecause we bring an unhealthy set ofdefenses and then at the end of the daythings come out the same because we'rebringing an unhealthy set of defensesright there can be other motivationsthat are related to all of that andthere's again this complexity to it butbut the compulsion part can be that wecan re-enter situations that didn't gowell with the idea that we're gonnawe're gonna fix what happened in thepast we're going to make ourselves feelbetter we're going to take away the markof trauma because remember traumadoesn't care about the clock or thecalendar so that's why you'll seesomeone who has had say five abusiverelationships that looked very much thesame right and is about to enter thesixth right and he said it's not becausehopefully in most cases not because thatperson like wants to be hurt right Imean sometimes it's a different problemright but but there can be a driveinside of us to try and fix something ifI can make it work this time I won'thave to feel so bad about the other fiveright so an attempt to change the pastthrough one's current actionsright which is rooted in the limbicsystem and how and how trauma affects usand how again it's outside the clock inthe calendar so that kind of magic so tospeak can happen so the brain can seekthat magic but again their unhealthydefenses coming into play right therehas to be denial right otherwise theperson would map you know if the samething happened five times and this looksthe same it's probably going to happennow right so so anytime you think a aperson most often it's us right you knowis smart enough or worldly enough tolike know better which it happens allthe time right then look for the answerright you say well shouldn't that personknow better than to get into the sixabusive relationship the answer is likeyes right like because it's not thathard if you saw a set of circumstancesfive times to map that the six is goingto have the same outcome right theperson would do that in other scenariosright so then you say right that is trueso now let's look for why the person itdoesn't recognize that and again we godown into the structure of self and thefunction of self defense mechanisms inactions salience the things that we'retalking about now does that fit yeah itmakes sense and what what comes to mindis the idea of I'm getting into a carthat you know is going to get into anaccidentover and over and over again but beingquite cognizant of safety and itsimportance in every other domain of Lifeyes not even jaywalking right butgetting into like if certain Ubersarrived with a little flashing lightthat said this ride is going to have anaccident it's like getting getting intothat vehicle and I see this in others aswell yes and it raises all sorts ofquestions likeum is the person actually uhunconsciously afraid of the vehiclearriving where they want to go becausethenum like are people actually afraid ofthings working outum I mean this gets to something that uhI'm so sorry can I can I say yeah that'swhy you have to know the person rightlike who is that person right why dothey not want to get in that car rightare they afraid they're not going to getsomewhere are they afraid they're goingto get somewhere right but ultimatelywe're looking for unhealthy defenses andI I so want to emphasize that that youknow I will often think that the aspectof my education that's most most helpfulin me doing my job when I'm when I'm inthe job as a practicing psychiatrist isis actually my mathematics minor rightbecause there's a lot more math to thisright people tend to think oh mentalhealth it's all it's all esoteric andyou can sort of say anything you knowanything you you want and there's no wayof proving or disciplinary it's it's notlike that at all right there's amathematical aspect to it so if you dothe correct logical Common Sense thingright in all aspects of your life exceptone and you're like100 times more intelligent than you needto be to figure it all out right thenthen if there's a carve out we say lookthat's of huge interest right I mean theprobability that we're going to findsomething interesting there's a hundredpercent right because we know that youknow better we know that you do betterbut but why here so like that's sointeresting right like that's where thex marks the spot like let's go dig thereright so then when we go and dig therelike we're gonna find something rightand and we'll see like what is that likedo we find that like oh it's an array ofreally unhealthy defense mechanismsmaybe we find that do we find thatthere's a deep unconscious motivationright like we might find that too rightthere we might find a lot of thingsright but we're going to find them if wego back to what is the structure of selfwhat is the function of self if we goand look like that x marks the spotmeans there's Pay Dirt there right andthen when we figure that out then we gothrough and we can make things change soif it's a deep sea needed trauma-drivenunconscious motivation that is resultingin an unhealthy array of defensemechanisms well let's go look at thatright let's look at the trauma let'stake the thing that's unconscious andand bring it to Consciousness right thenwe can make that better and that arrayof unhealthy defenses again we're notgoing to change it overnight but can wechange it very very significantly prettyrapidly probably yes and we can almostentirely change it across time sothere's a mathematical aspect of thisthat I think is so important to pointout because you know mental health ifthis even as a field right just meant weall want to be mentally healthy likethere's a rhyme and reason to it thatyes it follows science and yes it alsofollows common sense and if we applythose things we get to answersit's very reassuringthank you"

            "text": "thinking about the functions of self andagain just to remind myself and andother people it starts withself-awareness involves defensemechanisms in action then there's thesaliencepeace but paying attention to what'sinside of us as well as what's externaland then you're now describing a lot ofyour choices choice making and behaviorand action in the worldI have to assume that for for the persontrying to improve themselves and get toagency and gratitude uh that payingattention to all of these is isimportant but of course if a defensemechanism is unconscious we can't simplydecide okay I'm gonna see theunconscious defense mechanism does thatmean that we should ask ourselves aboutwhat is most Salient to usum or should we be focusing on ourbehavioral choices I mean in the exampleI just gave I'm aware of my behavioralchoices making certain decisions toengage with certain people and and notwith othersuhbut should I be asking for instance youknow what saline like like what are thethoughts leading up to that decisionum in other words how does salience ofinternal and external uh cues andprocessesum relate to behavior and which of theseshould we be paying attention to if ourgoal is to eventually change ourBehaviorso so if you think about what we'restarting right we're sort of starting atthe bottom right so we're starting withokay there is an I right and that's justnot just an apprehension right there's alot to that right so so for example Iknow someone who who is doing somemirror meditation staring into themirror right looking back itself withinit with a desire to be aware like thereis a me like this me is in the worldright this is the first I've ever heardof such a practiceum except when I was in elementaryschool or maybe it was the ninth grade Ihad a teacher who talked about gave usan assignment to look in the mirror andask ourselves questions but if Iunderstand correctly you think there'sutility to people spending a few minutesor more looking in the mirror andthinking about oneself in the eye as away to build up this self-awareness do Ihave that right if you want to take thebest care of yourself that you can rightyou want to understand yourself the bestyou can you want to make your life thebest it can be right then if they'reanswers right and let's say the answersare in five or ten different cupboardsright look in all all of them right Imean that's that's the idea right thatif if we want to know something lookeverywhere for it and also realize whatwe are building right what we arecreating maybe a recipe there may bethings from different cupboards thatoverlap so the way to translate thatpractically is to say to find theanswers to what what is either ailing uswhy we're repeating things we don't wantto repeat or even if things are goingokay but we want them to be going betterbecause we don't quite feel the peaceand contentment we want to feel thenlook everywhere so in this the functionof cells and the function of self startwith the I right there are ways ofincreasing self-awareness you know theycan range from contemplation of self tomeditation to looking in the mirrorright there are things that we can do tomore strongly emphasize to ourselvesthat there is an eye and this eye isgoing through life right then we knowthat there are defense mechanisms andthat they're present that they're actingin us right we can't just see that thembecause they're unconscious but if westart thinking about them we can learnabout them right and that's wheresalience comes into play salience kindof points both ways right sailings canpoint us towards the unconscious mindright oh I I realize I'm doing this overand over again or I'm saying this thingto myself over and over again where isthat coming from we start becomingcurious about ourselves and we look tothe unconscious mind and then we alsolook to the conscious mind that's whyafter salience is behavior like what amI doing right and a lot of times wedon't know just examples of we don'tknow why we're doing things rightsomeone who wants to lose weight butalways goes to the grocery store andcomes home and he's like has some senseof surprise that there are things therethat they don't want to eat right likewhy am I behaving in a certain way whydo certain things bother me when otherthings don't right why am I reallytouchy about one thing and not anotherwhy might there be things that botherothers and not me or vice versa right soso you know we're looking at what'sgoing on inside of us us and then how werespond right because how what may beupsetting me or what's going on insideof me both conscious and unconsciousright is then determining how I'm actinghow I'm behaving in the world around meif I want a better job but I never takean interview for another job I'm notgoing to get another job if I want aromantic partner but I automaticallyturn away from anyone who Smiles at meI'm not going to have a romantic partnerright if I want life to be better andthere's a certain thing I repeat and Idon't want to repeat that I want tounderstand myself better so I can changethe behavior and that's why the the thefunction of self ends with strivingsright the stripings are into the futureI know there is an eye I know there's anetwork and web of defense mechanisms inaction I know that there's saliencegoing on inside of me and I'm only goingto pay attention to a few things fromthe thousands I could pay attention to Iwant to be aware of that and have morecontrol over that then I'm enactingbehaviors I'm engaging in the worldaround me and ultimately I want thingsright I want life to be better I want tohave that feeling that you can get to Iwant to be in the state of of agency andgratitude so again these two pillarsstructure of self function of selfthat's where all the answers are sothere are all the cupboards right thereare these five covers in the structureof self and five in the function of selfand I know there'll be a you know we'llhave it out there in a PDF right becauseyou can go back there and that's wherethe vast majority of answers are to bothunderstanding and routes to changewhat you just described is incrediblyhelpful it's absolutely apparent to me"

at the level ofbehavior you know I think this is thethe just do it Mantra well just do theright thing right you know you you'renot finding a romantic partner like youknow schedule three dinners with friendsand ask them to invite over people whoare looking for part it sounds reallysimple right butum much as with the example of my friendwho lost all this weight throughbehavioral change that the fear stilllives within them very very strongly andso clearly there's some some stuffhappening underneath there nowfortunately he did lose the weight andhe's kept most of it off but it's clearto me that until he addresses some ofthese other issues of salience and uhdefense mechanism self-awareness Etcthatum the fear he's still experiencingmakes total sense because the foundationof that change is not near really asstrong as it could be maybe right ormaybe it doesn't have to have the fearbut he's not going to learn either onewithout the explorationso he won't if there is risk he won't beable to avert the risk and if there'snot risk he's then sort of laboringthrough life which is difficult enoughwithout being worried about somethingyou don't have to be worried about rightso the process of inquiry will alwaysmake that better it's clear to me thathis fear of regaining weight isabsolutely sapping his enjoyment and hisproductivity in other domains of life soWarren's attention right because becausewe're deciding in that sort ofmathematical way like it doesn't have tobe that way it doesn't mean it canchange overnight but it can beunderstood and it can be changedwell it's for that reason and many otherreasons that I'm very grateful that youexplain these two pillars structure ofself and function of self and how theseflow up to empowerment and humility andhow those flow up to agency andgratitude you've given us a a set ofideals and a road map of how to getthere and one that we're going tocontinue with in a moment hereum I did want to reiterate what you saidwhich is that there is a pdf version ofthis the structure or this road map ofideals and how to get thereum that's been provided as a link in theshow note captionsum so people can refer to them there invisual form if they like if you'reinterested in understanding yourself andin having goodness in your life as muchas you possibly can then you'reinterested in the structure of the mindand this means that you're interested inthe unconscious mind in all the thingsthat go on a million things a secondthat we don't know or understand one byone but that we can explore andunderstand better in total we're alsointerested in the conscious mind inbeing self-aware or interested in thearray of defense mechanisms and whetheror not they they're elegant and lightpasses clearly through them or whetherthey're distorting light and creatingmisperception if you're interested inthe structure of the mind then you'realso interested in the characterstructure right like what is yourcharacter structure what is the nestaround all of it how do you interfacewith the world and then you'reinterested in the self that you growfrom that phenomenologically meaningwhat is your experience of self how doesit feel to you these are all importantparts of this pillar of health andhappiness the other pillar is thefunction of the mind and of coursethere's overlap there are differentcovers but the cupboards all containdifferent ingredients that together makethe recipe right so if we're interestedin the function of the mind then we wantto pay attention that there's an eyelike we want to be self-aware and wewant to cultivate self-awareness we'realso interested in how those defenseMech mechanisms work when they're inaction right what's Salient inside of usand outside of us what are we payingattention to how are we behaving whatare our strivings do we feel hopefulabout ourselves and the world around usand if we're interested in all of thesethings we can't help but be respectfulright of just how complicated this islike life is difficult in understandingourselves is is difficult you knowWonderful Joy can come of living lifebut it is hard and it's hard day by dayand trying to understand ourselves goingto these places these pillars that holdthe answers right they they can't butmaking us a respect for all of it rightand the respect for ourselves for othersbrings with it humility right when wecome to this point of looking atourselves and exploring then yes webecome empowered right because we'vegained a lot of knowledge right we'redigging where the Pay Dirt is and we'refiguring things out and along with thatempowerment comes humility arespectfulness for how difficult all ofthis is how complicated we are how wecan make happiness in our lives but howit certainly isn't easy and we take withus the empowerment and the humility andwe express them right and if we'reexpressing empowerment and humility wecome to living through agency andgratitude so here both are active wordsso agency it's easier to see it it's anactive word where I'm aware of myability to to project myself into theworld around me I know that I can'tcontrol everything right but I'm reallytrying to understand what can I controlright how can I control it what do mydecisions now lead to in the future soagency is very very active rightgratitude is active too right becausewe're bringing an active sense ofgratitude since of the amazingness thatwe're here and and pride in ourselvesand others for being here and and tryingto move forward as best we can and thenwe bring that to our interactions we'remuch more likely to have a kind gesturetowards others instead of being angrywe're much more likely to have somethingcompassionate to say including toourselves than we are to have somethingangry to say that gratitude accompaniesagency their their active words andthey're active together and if we'reliving life through agency and gratitudeI mean there's a lot of wisdom aboutthis there's a lot that's been writtenand researched about this and if youlook at what is it telling us rightremember things are getting simplerright as we're getting higher up the thelevels here right the unconscious mindis most complicated now we're at hey canwe live our lives with agency andgratitude at the Forefront and what doesit bring for us and I think it bringswhat we are seeking that we might sayokay we're seeking happiness and thatcan mean lot of things you know a lot ofdifferent things it can be a very activething am I happy in the moment and wecan use happiness sometimes to distractourselves like happiness is importantbut words when people really think likewhat is it that they want or what is itthat they have right if they're they'reOverjoyed to be alive right they'refinding a sense of Peace they're findingcontentment they're finding Delight theability to be delighted right this iswhat people want are are human historyand our our searchings tell us this inour own experiences tell us this and andnow it could lead a person to think wellokay what's going on I mean is is thissomeone who's you know levitating at thetop of a mountain like is this just astate is this a state that people are inand and the answer is no it'll besometimes we could be in that statewhere we can feel peace there's notension inside of us right I can feel Ihave times when I don't feel tensioninside of me there's contentment there'speace I don't have to drive towardsanything right but it's not the passiveexperience of it because we are livinglife it's that that feeling goes hand inhand with a drive within us that we'rewhen we're in this healthy place we areliving life the decisions that we'remaking what is putting the rubber to theroad it is a generative Drive within usthere is a drive to make things betterto understand and to explore and it'sthat drive that we access and cultivateand synonymous with happiness is it'snot just the the state when people wantto be happy and that very very generalway yes contentment peaceDelight right but but they're happeningas we're living life right as we'reenacting a generative Drive where we'relooking at ourselves and the worldaround us and we're interested inunderstanding

that so aggression can beuh it can be active violent aggressionfor example but aggression can also be asort of a sense of agency right theinaction of agency like I want to dothings I want to change things I want toI want to make the world a differentplace right that that all of that comesunder this drive so so aggressive anaggressive drive is not a bad thing ifwe had no aggressive drives the thoughtswe've just lie down and nothing elsewould happen and then we'd all be goneright so so there's a way in which thisdrive within us moves us forward rightand of course extremely complicated theways we can manifest too much of it ortoo little of it or how our defensemechanisms can intertwine with the drivebut the drive is there it's like it'sfuel within us that comes with ourexistence and then how that fuel movesus forward how much of it there is nothat is determined by the meshing of thedrive with how we're living life rightand the same would be true of pleasureyou know the pleasure Drive doesn't justmean like we all want to be hedonistsright inside it means that we wantthings that are gratifying right we wantto feel good right this isn't just youknow the drive towards physical pleasurelike a sex drive or or eating food orhaving Comfort like all of that can bepart of it but it's a drive for Reliefright the idea that we don't want to bewhite knuckling life right searching forpleasure so having aggression within usas we White Knuckle life and we searchfor some pleasure and relief right thesedrives within us can be healthy they canbe unhealthy you know they can beanything right they're they'reWellsprings within us that then fuel usforward and there's controversy to theidea of is there a generative drive andthere's certainly at parts of the fieldthat do not think so right but therehave been strong thinkers in the fieldthat have thought we do have agenerative drive that it is within us tolook around us to be curious to beamazed right to think like how how can Iengage with this and make this better orhappier to think outside of ourselvesright to think if I if if I feel goodand you're in pain can I make you feelbetter right having nothing to do withme right the idea of altruism coming tothe fore and having industriousness withus within it right and and the idea thatthere is a generative drive it'sstrengthened when you look at how humansbehave when you know we're notstruggling right that people areinterested in learning you know youthink about how how much of people giveof themselves to learning right or toserving others like there's so much ofthis goodness in the world around us nowif we shut people away right they haveno you know imagine you know God forbidsomeone is in a solitary confinement forwhen they're the moment they're born youknow then there's not an opportunity forthe generative drive to thrive right andwe see so many so many situations whereit doesn't Thrive enough right you knowviolence in people's surroundings lackof opportunities right that we cansquelch a generative Drive anyone'sgenerative drive but if we giveourselves opportunities if you know ifwe're healthy that we're not weigheddown by trauma and illness andmisperceptions of self when we can livelife in a way that brings us to agencyand attitude now we're aligning with thegenerative drive that I absolutelybelieve is within us I think just lookat life look at human beings we observethat we have this drive within us and ifthat drive is at the Forefront and thatdrive then naturally of course allieswith agency and gratitude then I thinkwe're at the place that is the place wewe ultimately seek right and that we canfind it for brief periods of time so soby really pursuing this at like reallystrongly in my own therapy andreflection and attempts to understand Ican have periods of time where I canfeel that way I can feel outward growthand interest in the world and and I feelgood I'm not trying to answer somequestion of like why am I alive or likeI'm doing things that I feel good aboutand I feel good about doing those thingsand about being in the world and and Ithink this is not uncommon you know itmay be far more common in societies thatare allegedly less Advanced right thatis have less distractions or maybe youknow less uh knowledge of of all theawful things in the world that canhappen to us that are constantly fed tous like there's a whole bunch of otherquestions and topics about it but butthis this you know I have this absolutebelief that there's this generativeDrive in us that wants to Ally withagency and gratitude and that we allhave it within us to bring those to theForefront and to find that thing that weseek whether someone this person saysit's Nirvana the other person says it'sJoy or happiness or peace or numbing youknow whatever it is there's there'ssomething to it where we're not feelingthe tension within us we're not feelingthe anxiety the pressures but we'refeeling a sense of goodness the wayyou're describing it um makes perfect"

thatapproximately a half hour after I wakeup I start to feel more physicallyenergized I'm not somebody who just popsout of bed and is ready to go exerciseor do mental workbut about 30 minutes or so after wakingmy mind starts to wake up and I'venoticed that if I read a scientificpaper or if I read a chapter in a bookor if I do something that feels a littlebit difficultcognitively difficult in particular thatum the sense of satisfaction that I getfrom that is immense and it's notnecessarily the case that I have tolearn something that I'm going to usethat day but for me learning and um andoften learning and sharing what I learnwith the world whether or not they wantto hear it or notum is part of my uh pleasure Loop and umand I've learned that if I don'tcapture some new knowledge in a waythat's challenging in the morning timeum I I feel like the gears are stillturning but but I start to lose energywhereas if I find something interestingin particular and and write it down andand I feel like I own it that's what Ienjoy so much about learning it's likeit's in there maybe it'll be useful atsome point maybe it won't but it's likea it's like a animal finding a tool thatit can maybe use to forage more moreeffectively later in life I I get such asense of satisfaction that then I findthat I have immense energy to dowhatever is next like whether or notthat's exercise or learn more or preparea podcast or write a grant orum or work on a paper and this featureof my mental life has is so prominentthatum I almost have to force myself to doit each day and there are so manydistractions in the world nowadays thatI've come to a place where I almost haveto force myself todo what I know works for meum but when I do it feels like a almostlike a chemical Rocket Fuel and itdoesn't make me manic or crazy I don'tneed to pick up the phone and callsomebody or tell everybody about herpost it on social media it's more of adeep sense of satisfaction and and I getenergy from it is that the generativeDrive well it's great that that worksfor you what you're saying is that foryou like you can prime your generativedrive that way right and then you primeit you prime the pump it gets revved upright like and then and then you knowit's it's really manifesting itselfinside of you I mean there's manydifferent manifestations of thegenerative drive as there are peopleright so something's going to work forsome person other things are going towork for a different person right butbut but you're saying that hey I knowthis thing works for me and even thoughsometimes it's not easy to do I do itand then look what it gets for me rightand that's that's really healthy rightit's like no knowing that this thingworks for you and then you becomecommitted to it because your generativeDrive is is is reallystrongly supported by it right and thenyou have this sense of Good Feelingright so then you have you have thepeace and you have the you know just theoverall sense of goodness right the youknow peace and contentment and Delightyou're getting that and learning and inteaching so so you you're figuring outlike hey this works for me right andagain you don't have to figure it outthrough this lens it's if we find partsthat aren't working then we go back andwe figure them out right maybe a goodexample maybe is um so let's say youtake someone whoacrylic enjoys gardening and getssomething out of gardening right sothere are as many generative drives andhow they're measured out as there arehumans but there can be common outcomesof them right so the enjoyment of offostering plants growing a garden islike that's not uncommon in humans rightso imagine someone who hasn't been doingthat right they really want to they havea drive to do it there's a plot of landin the back that they used to cultivateright so if they're not doing it for anynumber of reasons maybe maybe they weredepressed and they needed mental healthtreatment maybe they just got away fromthe path that they were on maybe theirdefense has shifted a little bitwhatever the case may be they go back tothe pillars and they figure it out rightand now they're in accord withthemselves right and they're livingthrough agency and gratitude and theyfeel like wait I can go back out thereand I can till that land I can I can getthe hoe out I can you know I can makethe plus I'm going to put the seeds inI'm going to nurture like I can go go dothat and I can do it even what eventhough I was depressed even thoughsomebody assaulted me five months agoyou know even though I lost my job eventhough even though even though rightthey overcome the even those right andthe sense of agency tells them right Ican go do that right and the sense ofgratitude no one who's miserable and andnow is you know is in such an awfulposition about life because they wereattacked or lost their job or somethingbad happened whatever it may be orthey're lost in cynicism there's nogratitude there right it's a gratitudefor being in Life or having thecapability of going back and andplanting seeds in that Garden that's thealliance between agency and gratitudeand then the person goes and does thatright so think of what's going on therethey do this thing they feel good aboutthis thing they can have they can lookout at the Garden feel some peace rightfeel some contentment to them bedelighted by what they did remember howmuch they loved it before how much itmeans to them so yes that goodness comesthat goodness suffuses us and it raisesup the generative drives that says rightit's it's good we breathe some life intoit right enough to get that Garden donenow the generative Drive is furtherfostered forward by the goodness theperson feels so so the example and thedifference between the person who's likewants a garden feels terrible aboutthemselves that they're not doing it andit feels lousy every time they look outthe window and there they are lookingout the window right the differencebetween that and having made a gardenlooking out the window at it is a nightand day difference and the the personwho's looking out the window at theGarden that they build overcomingwhatever was inside of them because theythey went and addressed it and andproved to themselves that they couldthat's what we're after in life rightit's we all know this it doesn't looklike somebody levitating at the top of amountain right that's what it looks likethe person looking out the window at theGarden and thinking about what theyovercome came to create the garden andseeing the goodness of it all yeah I'mglad you said the word creating becauseit seems It's about creating things itreal tangible things but that theprocess to get there is every bit asimportant we're not what's created whenyou create knowledge that that'stangible right like you you createknowledge maybe that that person looksdown the row of beautiful flowers andhas the same sense of goodness inside ofthem that you do when you're we're likeright I just I just went and learnedsomething as you described that I I'mthinking I I certainly hope so becausefor me it's it's an incredible sense ofsatisfaction and andum one that I enjoy so much that Ialmost don't want to look at it too muchbecause to me it it sits in this um uhrare domain of perfect like it's just itjust feels so good and thatum and that I can get back there is veryis very comforting to me right andthat's all of this that it feels so goodthat's what all this is It's thegenerative drive right it's a it's theGratitude it's the contentment it's likeall that coming together and it'sinteresting we could contrast that to towhen you talked about a repeated cyclethat's negative right then you're notfeeling that right so so think about thelearning that can come from it rightthat you you can you can achieve thisand feel this and be in this state inone aspect of your life like what canyou learn from that to bring to theother place and more yes that'simportant it's more it's often startingwith what's going on in the place that'snot doing well right like I said why therepetition right so this is how we wecan have what we're seeking in parts ofour Lives even if we don't in others butif we can have it in parts of our Liveswe can have it in others too and we canbecome role models for ourselves we canlearn from ourselves we can learn fromwhat brings the good to how to raise upthe things that about us in our livesthat aren't there yetI often get the question from thegeneral public how can I stop"

your thoughts on thatthinking can be wonderful if we're usingthinking to learn right to figure thingsout so when thinking is doing thatthinking is great but a lot of thinkingis just in the service of something elseright and a lot of thinking worksagainst us so imagine the person makingthe garden right look at the person hasto think about it if you think aboutwhat seeds to make they have to thinkabout where the the tools are they haveto think about what they're doing whenthey're planting when they're wateringthere's a lot to do but the beauty of itisn't in the thinking right the thinkingis in the service of what is generativeright so so that's a different kind it'sit's just thinking in the service ofsomething but a lot of our thinking isthat you know it's it's planning it'sprojecting we tend to glorify theplanning and the projecting and and itcan be great when we're learning whenwe're figuring things out but a lot ofthat is is there so that we can do thethings that are good for us to do rightthe planning and the projecting aroundmaking the garden where the point of itis the garden it's not the thinking partright we can also use thinking againstus so much thinking is repetitive andand not just not just unproductive butharmful right that person who's lookingout the window at the Garden may bethinking I mean sometimes they're justpauses in our thinking but you know alot of times the person must be thinkingand and what often goes on there is justrepetitive negative thinking it'syou know gosh I used to have a garden Iremember when that was beautiful or youknow remember beforesuch and such a person passed away andthen we stopped making the Garden orI'll never be able to make a gardenagain or gosh it's too much you knowit's just something that's negative andunproductive I mean what else is thereto think if the person's actuallylooking out the window at the Gardenright and they're in this sort of stuckstate they're not in a generative Stateand the thinking becomes becomesrepetitive and it furthers all thenegative right she said The more wefurther the negative the more we take ifthere's a four-lane highway that we wantto atrophy unless I make it into asix-lane highway you know but but we dothat when when we have this repetitivethinking which then can evolve into thenarratives the things that we say toourselves right so so your thinking iswonderful it's wonderful but it can alsojust observe something else and it canalso be used against us so what we'retalking about here doesn't glorifythinking I mean it does if it's in theservice of the generative drive but itdoesn't in and of itselfI think many peopleumset a time say you know 9 30 a.m or 10a.m when they are going to begin doingsomething that they want to do or knowthey should do that's a little bitchallenging it could be exercise couldbe cognitively demanding workand then 10 o'clock rolls around theysay okay 10 15. and they're distractedby often social media texting these daysI think those are the main culpritsreallyum I don't know too many people that getdistracted by exercise and reading bookssome doum and doing complex puzzles or math butum you know social media is a little bitlike mental chewing gum except that Iwould add to that that's the kind ofchewing gum that um really does shakethe appetite in a way that prevents youfrom eating nutritious food unless usedcorrectly rightum and then people feelbad about themselves because the wholemorning went bynow it's noon then they require somefood like any uh typical person rightand they eat then they might need alittle nap for the Post perennial dipand energy and then the afternoon andthen it goes on and on I mean I I hearthis all the time I've experienced thisbefore so I'm not immune to this myselfthat's why I try and capture that earlywave of energy whatever it might beadrenaline nor adrenaline uhsome combination the way you describethinking and its potential relationshipto generative Driveit seems to me it's so important that wecapture those moments of potentialcreation however small the action mightbe to remind ourselves that we arecapable of moving things from point A topoint Bbecause in the description I just gaveof the person that lets the morningEscapethere's there's reallyum no external barrier except thesedistractions but differently all thetools exist within most all of us to beable to create what we want to create orat least to create something right Imean that rightum and yet many many people just don'tfulfill thatum that right that they were and thatwe've all been given right so let'sthink about what's going on there rightso so the person that I'm going toexercise at 10 o'clock right now andpush it back to 10 15 and they dosomething on social media or they pushit back to 10 30 it'll be okay I'll getit all in what they're doing is they'rethey're engaging in is unhealthy defensemechanisms right so if we go back to thethe pillars right the the structure ofself the function of self there may beother reasons for it but let's justidentify the unhealthy defenses ofavoidance and rationalization right andthen there's no thinking going on aboutthat right religious unconsciousprocesses and you kick it down you knowyou kick it down the clock 15 minutesright they're not thinking about itthinking then is subserving somethingdifferent right the thinking issubserving the avoidance if I'm going togo look on something and read a coupleof things reply you know I'm thinkingI'm planning right I got to get themaybe I got to get the phone out I gottatap you know my code into it I got to goto a certain website like you were doingsomething that we're thinking about it Ithink about what I'm going to write backbut the thinking is all in the serviceof the unhealthy defenses right so thenby understanding ourselves better we canwe can bring that right to a healthierPlace how by by actually using thinkingfor what helps us right so let's thinkof like what okay what's going let's sayif you're doing that okay what's goingon when you're doing that right so so doyou you really want to exercise rightbut like it's not easy to exercise andsometimes maybe just problem solving areyou doing a thing you like maybesomething you like more there's lowerbarrier Etc but let's say a we're justworking within the psychological rightthen you can come at that a couple ofways like I don't want to do that thingthat thing's hard right I mean I thinkthat about things in my life sometimesand it always makes me happy makes meweighty and unhappy right I may as wellput 20 pound weights on either side ofme right I mean I can look at it thatway right or there's a different way oflooking at it that actually fits muchbetter which is like I'm not daunted bydoing difficult things and I can get outthere and apply myself and you know andI feel good about that when I dodifficult things it's like part of myidentity right it's like part of how Isee myself so right I'm gonna go do thisthing and I'm going to feel good aboutit and isn't it amazing that I get to doit right like look here I am I'm aliveI'm healthy right I can go do this thingmy health is is good but I want to makeit better right by working out or I'm atleast alive and if I lose a little bitof weight I'll feel healthier like comeon this is good right and then I'll feeldifferent about that right and like thetruth is one or the other it's like ohboth can be true now what will be trueis what you choose right and if youchoose the negative then yes theunhealthy defense is perpetuate and evenif you get yourself to do it today it'sharder to do it tomorrow that's whysometimes I'll say to a person like justtake a look at it and decide if you wantto do it or not if you don't want toexercise just decide you don'tright and then okay there's a trade-offfor everything maybe you're okay withthe trade-off right but what am I tryingto do there right is is bring toConsciousness that that person is makinga choice right do you want to do it ifyou want to do it if you want to do itit's great to just do it right and ifyou don't it's great to not do it unlessyou're being honest and clear withyourself and you're not wasting all thattime when you keep kicking it 15 minutesdown the you know down the clock youknow until it's too late does does thatmake sense that's I think how thestructure here really does it worksbecause it's it's pulling together whatwe know from the biology to thepsychology of like how to understandourselves and how to understand whenthings aren't the way we want them to beso that we can make them the way we wantthem to be it's not magic it's it'sfollowing this sort of mathematicalaspects of you know going to the factorsassessing them making changes and andthen of course we see the outcome wewant to see the way you describe it doesmake sense and I appreciate it because Ithink ultimately it seems to ratchetback to actions to verbs to bring us tothese feeling states that you know Ithink are what people are seeking youknow peace contentment Delight you knowthrough agency gratitude as active termsright yes you know I think these areUniversal desires and again you'reproviding this um wonderful road map forpeople to arrive there thank you I dohave a question about some of theunderpinnings of generative Drive

things out theyoften do create great lives forthemselves in in work and relationshipEtc I've also observed that these peopleoften don't have the best relationshipto themselves or that they run upagainst barriers or frankly sometimesstraight into brick walls in certaindomains of their life perhaps as aconsequence of having too much of thisgenerative or aggressive Driveand at the same time I know that thereare people in the world many that havewhat seems to be a low generative DriveI don't know if that's the case or notbutum that theyum they seem to have a hard timeengaging like in doing things and andoften you get the impression that theysomewhat are completely given uplike it's just like life is just toohard orum sometimes it's even more subtle likeI know someone who they like their jobbut they've ever come to the place thatum you know like it's just work likeit's a paycheck and that might be enoughbut they're always talking about it so Ihave to assume that it's not enough theyaren't able to slot their work into onedomain and just focus on the other uhaspects of their life that are goingwell it doesn't compensate for them tothink about the other aspects of theirlife that is soum is there a Continuum of generativedrives that exist in us are theseintrinsic I realize there are nearinfinite number of conditions that couldgive rise to one or the othercould be hardwired could be nature itcould be nurture but what is therelationship between kind of um I wantto say arousal or a potential forarousal and aggressive drive and uh andthese things that we're seeking yeahyeah so if it's okay I I I'd like tostart like the first principles of thedrives right so the theory of drivescame about when when people wereobserving very closely like human beingsand human behavior individuals uhsocieties cultures right and andidentifying that hey that you can boil alot of things down to to a drive that wecall aggressive right there's somethingto like impose myself out there on theworld around me right it explains a lotof what people do right and then theother identified Drive was pleasureright who was you know so enjoyment evenrelief of unpleasantness right that thethoughts like you can describe a lot ofhuman behavior and and that tounderstand like what's going on insideof us that means that we're here rightyou see that through the lens ofaggressive and pleasure drives and likethat's the answer to it to how wesurvive but I think that is not theanswer to it that if it were justaggressive drives and pleasure drivesthere's not a value system around thatlike you know somebody who's veryindustrious can build or destroy rightand we see this in historical figureslike being very intelligent and veryindustriousness has nothing to do withwhether you're building or destroyingright so if it were just an aggressivedrive and a pleasure drive then wewouldn't be having this conversationright because the species would havewould not have survived right so if youbelieve that and I believe that then youlook for something else you say maybe welooked and we found two things and thereare more things right and then we startthinking about learning for learning'ssake altruism things that are notexplained right unless there's aself-referential will you feel gooddoing something for someone else sotherefore it's selfish like there's alot of gyrations around that if youreally observe humans you do seealtruism altruism you see learning forlearning's sake you see people beingbenign when everything about a situationwould say that they could would orshould under society's rules not bebenign right and then we start to seethat there is another drive that how doyou explain that we're here yeahaggression pleasure and generativenessregenerative Drive the drive to makethings better that's why we build morethan we destroy we destroy a lot rightbut we build more than we destroyotherwise we wouldn't have clothes onour backs let alone have the thetechnology to sit here and to be able todo this so it's the generative drivethat that is most realized in thehealthy person right and the healthyperson has the strong generative drivenow as you said there are other factorsand this is sort of what you were askingabout they're probably they're naturallevels of aggression or pleasure seekingor generativeness that differ acrosspeople right because we're a product ofyou know the complexity of our geneticsand you know all the complexities ofNature and nurture so we're going to getto a place where where some of us havemore some of us have less right the thethe the the conclusion though is for allof us the generative Drive being at thehelm is what what leads us to be to livegood lives right to live to the thingsthat we aspire to the peace andcontentment right so we want thegenerative drive to Rule the Day rightwhether a person is studyingNeuroscience or growing gardens rightthe importance is about being generativethen then aggression and pleasure cansubserve the generative drive right andthen the question you're asking I thinkwhich is well what if there's too muchaggression too little aggression rightor too much pleasure seeking too littlepleasure seeking that's when we we cansee problems right and the problems thenlead us back to the pillars to figureout the problems so too much aggressionultimately becomes Envy right too muchaggression means like I want I I want toimpose myself on the on the world aroundme more than I can more than isreasonable more than I can do withoutimpinging upon others right that whatyou end up doing is taking from othersright too much aggression becomesdestructive right maybe a persondestroys tear something down right takesfrom others uh says that the the nastycomment when it wasn't necessary and noweveryone feels bad right right there'sthat too much aggression start itbecomes Envy right and envy isdestructive right the same thing withtoo much pleasure seeking if I say okayI want you know I want my fair share ofpleasure and you know relief of distressand all that but if I start if I rely onthat too much right we're now instead ofaggression eclipsing degenerative drivenow it's pleasure eclipsing thegenerative drive then I want morepleasure and more pleasure and morepleasure and how long before I want yourpleasure right so so then it's nothealthy right what it becomes is enviousright it becomes destructive because nowthen I become Covetous of your pleasureor if I can't get it but I could bringyou down then I'll feel better aboutmyself that's Envy right so too muchaggression eclipsing degenerative drivetoo much of the of pleasure seeking to apleasure Drive eclipsing the generativedrive and we end up in places of envyand envy is destructive and now we're introuble I've never thought before aboutthe relationship between aggression"

that guy'sbusiness card has been his and how hehates him so much he ends up killing theguy yes in very violent and sadisticfashion that's aggression overgenerative that's right right and so andthe whole movie is aboutum this one uh aspect of culture at thattime's ability to impose their will onever everyone at at their whim you knowbasically Bell just does whatever thehell he wants at any point goes returnsvideotapes in between and you know andthere's so much woven into it and uhthat is relevant and so much that'swoven into it that's just purely forpeople's kind of sick entertainment umuh but that I believe it was Brett BrentEaston Ellis that wrote that and youknow it's tapping into the theaggression component the pleasurecomponent but the Envy component isreally what resonates as as you come tothe end of the movie is like there's nosatisfying this guy he could kill her orsleep with as many people as he wants inthe movieum and he can have as much wealth as hewants he can have entire buildings infact I think he's living in an entirebuilding at some point he takes overpeople's Apartments after he kills themit's it's it's wild and disgustingum but it really speaks to the extent towhich Envy is woven into absolutelyaggression and pleasure seeking and it'snot something that had really sunk infor me until you describe it nowum because I think for most people theyimagine okay when somebody has X numberofmillions or billions of dollars thatthey'll reach this place of Peacecontentment and Delight right they'llhave enoughum and in the movie Wall Street there'sthat onescene where someone says you know what'syour number like at what point is itenough and the guy says more that saysall sorts of things about thedopaminergic system of reward systems inthe brain Etc but I think it says a lotmore about envy and just what and what apit of despair Envy is for everybodyinvolved right right look Envy may notbe the root of all evil but Envy plusnatural disasters Maybeso muchevil and destruction arises from envyand it may be that it's at the root ofall of it and we so under appreciatethat right we so underappreciate whypeople are destructive right which iswhy the roots aren't always in traumabut but a significant uh uh aspect of ofwhere Envy arises from can often betrauma creating a sense of guilt andshame and vulnerability but but wherevera person may come by it and it's alarger discussion of envy and where itmay come from is it drives destructionand if the aggressive Drive is greaterthan the generative drive or if thepleasure Drive is greater than thegenerative drive or if both are greaterthan the generative drive it will drivedestructionand that destruction the vast majorityof times if you look deep enough youfind at its roots envy that Envy mayarise from guilt and shame within theperson but as soon as it becomes aboutanother right I feel guilt and shame andinadequacy inside of me but then I feelEnvy of those around me it drives thevast majority of Destructiondo you think that's what's happeningwhen we see these um sadly ever morefrequent examples ofum active Shooters and school shootingsthings of that sort yes there are thereare other people who have liferight and that person doesn't feelthat they do so they want to go and takeitaway from them right that's why as longas we have human tribulation and a lotof Guns is is going to happen it's it'sa it's a logical conclusion of enoughpeople being in places of Despair andhow Envy can be cultivated within us andthen ultimately how it blinds people itcreates such a desire for Destructionthat then people will take life awayfrom others and often if people willsometimes take their own life whichwhich I think really brings to theForefront like that that person doesn'tfeel that they have a life certainly nota life worth preserving so they're thengoing to take the lives of others and Ithink we're seeing that is as Starka portrait of where Envy can lead Ithink as we can find on a one-personbasis we can go we can look at Wars andtheir destruction on a societal basisbut I think that's that's the ultimatein understanding where and we can drivea personwhat about the other end of the spectrumwhen aggression and pleasure seeking are"

notthenimposing themselves or believing thatthey can in in much of any way on theoutside world and that creates a senseof isolation understandably right asense of powerlessness and vulnerabilityand isolation and that then becomesdemoralizing which is not the same asdepression I mean you know we knowdepression is a it is there's aneurochemical imbalance right whetherthat imbalance came purely biologicallyor came psychologically or because ofexternal events there's a neurochemicalimbalance you know here we're nottalking about an illnessState as identified by modern Psychiatrythere's not a number in the in the bookof diagnoses that goes along with withbeing demoralized right but why becauseit's a state that humans can be in andtoo low of an aggressive drive right andall the things that come of that it'sisolating and it's demoralizing the samewith too low of a of a pleasure drive soan example that may be relatable isum to some people is you know knowingsomeone who who has had a couple ofreally bad breakups and and then says ohI'm not you know what I'm done with thatthere's no more Romance I'm going to besingle right and you know like thatperson has a drive in them like you knowthey're an interconnected person likethey they want romance so they these arethings that are important to them butthey they make a decision I'm I'm notgoing to have that in my in my life whatwould be called in some psychodynamicsenses inviting death into life a littlebit of death by by swearing offsomething that that the person has adrive towards right the pleasure Driveof companionship and of romance rightthat that then becomes demoralizing aswell so sure those things demoralizationcan predispose to depression butdemoralization is a thing in and ofitself is where then there's a sense ofhopelessness there's a sense of you knowthe goodness then is inaccessibleanymore and that's the other side ofEnvy can low levels of aggressionand the resulting demoralizationbe coupled with high levels of pleasureseeking so I'm thinking about the personthat um you know is like very overweightclearlyum headed for health issues if theydon't already have them andyou know perhaps would like to removethat weight would like to feel morevigorous doesn't want type 2 diabetesand an early death but at some levelthey've given up but because the thepleasure of eating is something theyreally enjoy they really love it and yetit has a component to it in their lifewhere they either self-soothed with itor they're just trying to hit Baselinelevels of satisfaction with it and andum they allow themselves to effectivelybe sedentary and and then the othersorts of trouble start to show up youknow sleep apnea from carrying excessiveweight and then they're feeling tiredduring the day and then who can exercisewhen they're too tired when you got towork and maintain other life demands andyou can kind of see where this couldarise and makes perfect senseum you can also see whereum if there were just a little bit moreaggression it could all be turned aroundbut they don't have it so is thescenario describe something that you'veseen clinically I certainly observe itin my non-clinical stance out there inthe world a lot right well I think themost important thing you're pointing outis that aggression and pleasure on thehigh end right we we know can Trump thegenerative drive right but that this canalso happen on the low end right soyou're describing a situation since it'sa great example right because it's notuncommon in the world around us so theaggression meaning the fuel to putoneself out there in the world right toutilize the sense of agency right sothis is going to be a person who's lowagency right the aggressive drive it hasas little fuel than to give the sense ofagency it's further squelched bynegative by you know negative sense ofself and negative self-talk now you findwhere the the aggressive Drive is is toolow and too low low can also Trump thegenerative drive right because then thatperson can't take care of themselves agenerative drive would say there's a lotof life to live in there can be greatthings in life and take better care ofyourself and by the way they're likepeople that you love and people thatlove you or or if not you know there'san animal regarding you love right so sothe generative drives is saying thatright but it's not winning the daybecause the the aggression or you knowaggression is one word we could put tothat drive you could call it anassertion drive you know we call it anagency drive but that's you know we'reusing agency in a different way but thatthing is too low so it wins out over thegenerative drive and then in the exampleyou gave it's not surprising that thepleasure Drive goes the other way maybethere's a predisposition to thatgenetically maybe it's just reinforcedbecause a person in that place could saywell think of what what this the theself-conception would be right I'm inthis terrible placeum it you know means I'm a terribleperson I can't make myself better or I'mnot good enough to get better no onecares about me I can't make anythingright so so therefore like I don't Idon't matter it's no reason to take careof myself so why would I not do if I eatthat one thing that I enjoy and it givesme pleasure even it gives me pleasurefor two minutes then I'll eat anotherone like in a sense so what well becauseI don't feel that I'm worth preservingor that I can preserve myself rightthere's a nihilism to it that then kindof makes it make sense to overindulgethe pleasure Drive whether it's awhether it's biologically predisposed orone is just arriving there but the thereason all that is badis because the aggressive Drive is toolow and in fact it's low enough thatit's outweighing the generative drivethen the pleasure Drive is going to comeinto you know one place or another ifit's also really low the person does notmuch of anything and wastes away whichtragically happens a lot in our societyright or if the pleasure Drive is highmaybe that person overindulges in thingsthat provides short-term gratificationand then that causes a different set ofproblems but but what's deterministicthere is whether whether aggression orassertion again we could put differentwords to that drive but what we've beencalling the aggressive drive and thepleasure Drive are they is one or theother or both high enough to Trump thegenerative drive or low enough to Trumpthe generative drive and and I think allproblems that we see like everythingfits into this model because it honorswhat we know right it honors what weknow about human behavior and insightsinto human behavior over hundreds ofyears right over thousands of yearsright the wisdom that really bringsforward and it honors the science andthat's why it fits together because Ithink it honors who we are as what arespecies is what we areum and you know what it's like what lifeis like as as we try and engage with ityeah I've seen cases of demoralized"

seems to changedespite multiple interventions from acaring standpoint from Friends EtcI've also seen examples of people whoare demoralized who seem to band withother demoralized people sort of try torecalibrate the standard that they feelum oppresses them you know that they andthis isn't necessarily just in the realmof physical fitness this is also in therealm of like School demands I I went toa very demanding High Schoolas I've talked about before on a coupleof podcasts I barely finished highschool I was not an attentive student Iwas my umaggressive and pleasure drives went intoa non-academic Endeavors and I regretthat you know I had so much making up ofof learning to do by time Iunfortunately got to college eventuallycaught up butum my experience of high school was thatthere were these you know kids scoringperfectly on the s.a.t and the earlyadmission to Harvard and early admissionto Yale and all these places and thenthere was you know a distribution in themiddle and then there was a collectionof of kids who were not doing well knewthey weren't doing well and kind ofbanded together around the idea of notdoing well I I didn't consider myselfpart of that group because I I franklywasn't there that often and andum I was focused on other things as Imentioned but butwhat came of that group was actuallyquite tragic not just for them but for alot of other people they uh eventuallyengaged it wasn't a school shooting typescenario but they eventually you knowset off explosives in the on the schoolcampus this was after they had graduatedum I don't know where they are nowadaysbut things did not go well for them andtheyum exerted a lot of uh destruction toother people around them but before theydid that there was this kind of bandingtogether around their the fact that theydidn't fit in that they and they weren'tbullied as I recall that I could bewrong about this but I've seen this inother forms too like you know if youcan't meet the standard band up withother people and change the standard andthen you don't feel as demoralizedperhapsum I can understand I can rationalizewhy this would be a a reasonableapproach butumI'm seeing this more and moreum I'm also seeing by the way you knowthe other end of the spectrum people areoverly aggressive and pleasure seekingand things of that sort but for for themoment I'd like to um your thoughts onyou know how demoralization can splitoff into different Expressions dependingon howum people feel and who else they'rerelating to yeah yeah well I think theplace I would start is to say like oursociety Russia's headlong forward in away that causes our society to tramplepeople who are vulnerable and vulnerablepeople are demoralized peopledemoralized people are vulnerable peopleand our society often tramples them andthen they're not here with us any longerand that is tragic but at times theydon't get trampled they get cast asideright they they they're injured rightand cast aside and from that placetragic things happen right people thenstay isolated you know I think it's atragedy that we don't all band togetherand go door to door right to like seekpeople who who aren't coming out ofdoors right you know in the sense oflike we let people be so so isolated andand oftentimes that's that's the tragicend of someone's story rightum sometimes people do engage righteither demoralized but they can engagein in ways that involve an affiliativedefense so sometimes people who aredemoralized can affiliate they can bandtogether in in ways as I think you werealluding to that can that can makethings better so if people aredemoralized because say they're a agroup in society that that ischronically very mistreated right thenit can be very powerful to band togetherboth because there's what's called anaffiliative defense that if I feel badabout myself about something and I'malone it's highly likely I'm going tocontinue feeling bad about myself aboutthat thing right but if you feel badabout yourself about the same thing andthen work together right we help eachother feel better we don't feel solonely we don't alone we don't feel soisolated we don't feel so ashamed rightso an affiliative defense can helppeople to to say wait a second like I'mnot there's nothing wrong with me andI'm not gonna take this lying down orsomething right and then and to to makeassertions that create better rights inthe world around us so so like very goodthings can happen from from affiliationin the context of demoralization butvery bad things can happen too rightbecause people can also affiliate aroundthings that are very destructive I meanif I am hateful of society and I wouldlike to be destructive and I'm aloneokay I could do destructive things alonebut if I band together with a coupleother people who feel that way and nowI'm empowered to feel that way rightinstead of maybe I feel that way and oror there's racism or Prejudice and Idon't feel like I can say that right butthen when it's permissive right becauseother people are are in the same placethen people can accentuate the hatredwithin you know within them soaffiliation is very very powerful andpart of society rushing so headlongforward and either trampling ormarginalizing people is that we thendon't pay attention or not enoughattention to what happens with theaffiliative groups right how do youguide people towards towards being ableto affiliate in ways that are productivehow do you give them routes of beingproductive right how do you try andprotect against the ways thataffiliation can lead to destructiveBehavior so I think you know a lot ofthis is these are the natural thingsthat happen within us but a lot of whatwe're talking about now gets impacted alot by society and societal standardswhich we of course all together you knowyou determine right and arise from usbut they they start to sort of transcendbecause it's now people interacting witha whole social systemgoing back to the other end of thespectrum"

you know whatare we to make of of that sort ofexample I mean I I like the idea that ifsomeone has a strong aggressive drivethat they would Channel it toward good Imean I have no reason to think thisperson is doing anything but good in theworld for themselves and otherscertainly not harming anyone at leastnot to my knowledgebut that seems like a rough place tolivefor me it seems like a rough place tolive and at the same time I'll offer avery brief anecdote that you know at onepoint in my career namely when I was apostdoc I was in a position by virtue ofhaving left a laboratory in the natureof the field at the time where the workI wanted to do was directly pittedagainst the work of another verypowerful Laboratoryexcept that I was alone postdoc workingin a laboratory essentially on my own onthis problem and I remember going to mypostdoc advisor the late Ben Barris andsaying you know I think it might justmove to a different problembecause I don't really want to go upagainst this Goliath and he said uh youknow this is the best uh you know I cancapture Ben's voice he said they'reabsolutely not like there's no way youlove this stuff you have to do itbecause you love it and he kept tellingme how much I love it and he reminded methat indeed I did love the questions andonce I was able to tap back into thelove for and the Curiosity around thequestionsI was able to push aside the theconcerns enough that we did wellum in publishing certain papers they didwell but those five years frankly were alot less pleasureful than they couldhave been I think because much of thescript in my head was that I was infriction with this like you know atleast in my mind this oppressive forceit was it was purely competitive and Itruly believe that we can't be at in ourmost creative state when we arecompeting with someone else bydefinition because then you're you'recreating against a standard as opposedto Raw Creation right soum in both cases a lot of aggressiveDrive frankly I I have some of that andI had thatum but a desire for Revenge a componentof friction mixed in you know orintegrated with this aggressive drivelike this picture like even as Idescribe it is you know causing therelease of a little little bit ofadrenaline it's it's not a comfortableState it's not it can't be a state ofHappiness right so as you said peoplecan do good in the world they can do notgood in the world like we're not makingvalue judgment about what the person isdoing because that's not what thequestion is about right like how arethey feeling how are they doing rightwhat's going on inside of them right andthat can't be happy right that can't behappy because if if if you're built tobe pretty good at competition right soyou can size up what are the factors youknow you can strategize right so aperson is built to be really good atcompetitionthen you know it sounds pretty good tomake everything a competition rightbecause you you have the highest winningpercentage right and but that's that'sgood to achieve some end right thatdoesn't have any feeling intrinsicallyassociated with it right and if allyou're doing is a series of competitionsand what you're doing then is winningright and like winning is something likeyou know winning is like I won I beatyou whatever that is like that that canbe part of happiness but it doesn't haveto be right that's not happiness rightso so yes that kind of I'm I'm reallybuilt to compete well and I'm gonna justsee a series of competitions in front ofme that's it for for expedient forwardprogress right that's very effective butagain expedient forward progress is isnothing to do with peace contentmentdelay like it's it's not you know itdoesn't have anything to do with that inorder to have anything to do with doinggood or bad right and I think theexample you gave in your own in yourcareer is like it's such a good exampleright because you know if you thinkabout it when the way that you were sortof framing it inside is like there's aquestion I'm asking there's a questionthey're asking right and there's acompetition right and again it has to betoo too to compete right so so there'salmost an automaticity right that likeyou're studying the same thing maybe youknow they feel competitive or certainpeople there too they were were and aredefinitely competitive they know whothey are they're extremely and verysuccessful okay so then so thenI'm in a competition now again but younever decided to be in a competitionright but but automatically right I meanit's interesting right to understandyou're acting as if you're in acompetition because I don't want thiscompetition right because like they'rebigger than me it's gonna be unpleasantit's going to take you away from reallythinking about what you want to do rightit's going to make it harder to do agood to do the job you want to do rightbecause now you're embroiled in you knowsomething that's you know that hasaggression behind it right so so youchoose no I don't I choose not to dothat right and then Ben Barris reframesit to the truth and says well this thisisn't this is not a competitionbecause you're not choosing to competeright because Ben pointed out what wasimportant to you was the questions rightso it's like almost as if Ben remind youno no this is not through the aggressiveDrive look at it through the generativedrive that's what wins out in you rightand thenyou go and apply yourself to it yeah andbless him for doing it because uh fromthat point forward I I've made it myum firm mission to always do things froma place of what I was thinking about asDelight you know curiosity Delight thethings that give me energy and that giveme more energy from doing themum it wasn't a coincidence I believethat in those five years when I wasoperating from a mix of generative driveand the competition would then resurfaceand you know I couldn't hold it constantthat um I was absolutely exhausted bythe end of that phase I just in a waythatum sucked a lot of the pleasure out ofit I still derived some pleasure butthen as I mentioned fortunately I wasable topivot back to doing things out of loveyou know and and and getting back to uhpeace contentment and especially Delightright you know right and I absolutelymake a value judgment about that rightthat what you did is better right sowhat if you did what if you weredifferent so think about if we talkabout it through this accurate lens whatif you were different at that time andthe aggressive Drive in you was greaterthan the generative Drive in you rightwhich would be an unhealthy state to bein but let's say you were in thatunhealthy State then you probably wouldhave still done what you did but youwould have done it through the lens ofaggression like I'm gonna get them rightnow you're competitive with them there'sthere's anger in you there's you knowthere's aggression right that you'reenacting in fantasy as you're you knowyou're thinking about them and howyou're going to win like all sorts ofthings go on inside of us and I wouldsay there's no way on Earth you couldhave done the science as well as you didright it couldn't be because all thatstuff is distracting right it's you knowthat kind of negative yeah affect poolsfor energy and time from you and alsowhat seeds would you have planted in thethe microcosm that you operate in rightmore more competition right morecompetitiveness more Badness right solet's look at what you did do rightbecauseyou're healthy or this particularquestion about this particular thing weknow for sure because your generativeDrive eclipses the aggressive drive thenyou set yourself to the work in a waythat's going to be more effective rightyour brain isn't clouded you're notwasting energy you know plotting somerevenge or plotting what you're going todo if they come take something from yourlab I mean whatever it is you know likeyou're not living in any of that soyou're going to do a better job at whatyou're what's so important to you to doand what seeds are you sowing then rightyou're sowing seeds of collaborationright and even then if someone could saywell what does even that matter rightsay well it doesn't matter because whatyou're doing then we just follow for themath of it right is contributing tounderstanding that's contributing tohuman health right and the betterunderstanding we have of human healththe more people stay alive and the morepeople stay healthy which could mean anyone of us just like any one of us couldbe the vulnerable person that Societytramples or casts aside we all have itin us to be that or have been that atstages of our lies right we also allhave it in us to be the opposite of thatright we have it in us to be generativewe have it in us to make good we have itin us to contribute to health tosurvival and that I place a valuejudgment upon it's why doing good isbetter than doing bad why creating isbetter than destroying and whyultimately it's the generative drivethat has to Trump the other drives andwhen it does we're happy we're healthywe make the world a better place we Allywith and are suffused with the Gratitudeand agency in us are fully active andwe're suffused with peace contentmentDelight as you said that's the place tobe from that place we get this thingthat we want and we help to make theworld a better place which helps us tokeep the

apsychiatristum which I think it's only fair toconsider in particular the way thatum at least from my outside non-clinicalunderstandingum these sorts of situations of highlevels of demoralization or excessiveaggression or just people not being inthe place or being able to exert theirtheirum their actions in the world the waythey want or not get the results theywant is they'll start asking questionslikeum you know maybe I have a chemicalimbalance or or maybe they'll go to aclinician maybe a cognitive behavioraltherapist orum or psychiatrist andmore often than not it seems they'll getyou know prescription for X number ofmilligrams of some serotonergic Agonistor uh dopaminergic agonists in it ofcourse as a neurobiologist I I you knowI applaud the exploration of underlyingbrain mechanisms and the involvement ofneuromodulators like dopamine andserotonin but what you're describingtoday is is very different I I thinkthenum what most people are can expect ifthey go to the typical psychiatrist ortypical psychologist which is part ofthe reason we're having thisconversation but um I'd love yourthoughts on thatum and I don't want to make this aboutme I only offer this anecdote as a wayto round out a little bit of the earlierdiscussion I'll I've never shared thispublicly but when I was a postdoc andgoing through that very hard phase ofcom competition that I didn't want andhaving a hard time staying in touch withthat and there were some otherdevelopmental things starting toresurface just by virtue of moving backto the town I grew up inEtc there I recall getting to thestairway of the building I was workingin at the time which is the same onewhere my laboratory exists now actuallyand realizing I couldn't go up thestairway I've always been reasonably fitum and just being so exhausted and thendriving home that day on 280 andthinking you know like none of thismatters like what am I doing like noneof it matters I could have beenexhausted I don't know what it was butwhat that ultimately resulted in was metalking to a psychiatrist who gave me alow dose of uh of a um of a serotonergicantidepressant I took that low dose ofserotonergy antidepressant I don'trecall which one it was maybe it wasCitalopram would that make sense and umspent that evening staring at my plateof Thai noodles for about two hours ithit me really hard and and I hated thatfeeling and then just stopped taking thedrugum now I'm not this is no knock onCitalopram or the use of serotonergicagents in the proper context they'vesaved lives so the problematic too but Ijust you know that wasn't the route thateventually got me out of it it was itwas mainly talk therapy and andself-careum but I just offer that because I youknow I even as a neurobiologist iperhaps especially as a neurobiologist Ithought okay here's the solution rightit's going to shift some internalmodulatory system and I'm going to feelokay about the situation I'm in andthank goodness it didn't work even for ashort while becauseum the while I didn't do all the thingsthat you're describing here of exploringthe function of self because no one hasever laid this out for me Ium I took the route of of talk therapywhich I find immensely beneficialtakes time but immensely beneficial sowhat are your thoughts on the currentstrategies for diagnosis where thosesucceed where they fall short and andthe role of medication in navigatingthis you know simple and yet complexlandscape right we are so dramaticallyover reductionist you know it's almostto the point of unbelievable right Imean think aboutgetting a medicine getting some saycitaloprambecause of what happened rightit can't possibly workright now maybe a judiciously chosenmedicine could provide a little moredistress tolerance and you could sort ofthink about it more and you could findyour way through it but clearly it wasan issue of self right like you're in asituation that was high stress and areyou going to have to have thiscompetition or not is it going to begood for you and you know you don't wantthat but can you avoid it like there'ssomething going on that makes you not beable to walk up those stairs right so soagain I'm not criticizing I don't wantthe person what kind of conversationsyou had about it with the person but theidea that a pill will fix that is likethat's insane right now medicines canhelp smooth the way so so let's say youyou initially when the first time yousee someone they say okay we have totalk about this right what's going on inyour life and you know because normallyyou can walk upstairs and go to workright why can't you now like we need tothink about that we need to talk aboutthat let's say you start doing that andyou're having a lot of trouble with ituh or you're just having really highlevels of anxiety we might say look atmedicine can kind of take thetemperature down a little bit you knowgive you a little more stress toleranceand then you know we can you can thinkabout it better inside of you and we cantalk about it better but it's medicinein the service of understanding nowsometimes medicines are doing thingslike medicines that can help preventbipolar episodes right like they'redoing something that is purelybiological but we use so many medicinesfor things that are not biologicalthey're psychological but we we're soover reductionist that we could actuallyover reduce the problem that you saidright like a clear wow that'sfascinating right like how many timeshave you gone up those stairs and nowyou can't it's so interesting the ideaof like let's just give you a pill Imean it it really makes no sense but ifwe're over reductionist enough you couldsee how that's the logical endpoint ofan illogical process right and I'll giveyou another example and this is reallyit's a true story of uh a woman whoyoung woman comes into the emergencyroom and she says she can't sleep andyou know she looks anxious and she feelsvery very anxious uh you know by herdescription that's why she can't sleepand and she gets a sleeping medicineand she goes home and then she comesback she comes back a couple days laterand she's very very anxious and shecan't sleep and she looks like she didbefore like nothing seems to bedifferent and she hasn't gotten anysleep at all sothe doctor in charge gives her a higherdose of the sleeping medicinethen she goes homeand then she comes back yet again andnothing is any different she's still notsleeping she's still anxious and thenthe doctor concludes that she's drugseeking because she wants more and moreof the sleeping medicineokaywas actually going on was she wasgetting hurt at homeshe was terrified to go homeof course she couldn't sleep right likebad thingswere happening right but no one askedthe question right they thought shecannot sleep we'll give sleepingmedicine instead of asking why right andthen she gets home to send home and whenthe medicine doesn't work well nowthere's something wrong with herright and you put that label on her nowshe's drug seeking right then she's notgoing to get any help right so I'm notagainst medicines I mean I I usepsychopharmacology as part of mypractice and I think from a from abiologically based perspective aboutmany things but we have to know whatsomething is the answer for and whatsomething is not the answer for and inthe in the overly reductionist world ofthroughput in in Healthcare Systemspeople are even being trained these daysthat don't know any different right I'mtrying to be overly critical ofpractitioners because oftenpractitioners are working in impossiblesituations where the goal is throughthroughput and that's more efficient inthe short term right it's more efficienttoday right but it's of course not goodin anything but the today term and it'sinteresting because it's never good forthe person even today it's like nevergood for the people in it right but butoften these decisions are being madebased upon business and money and Iunderstand business and money I'm I'm acapitalist I'm interested in thesethings but the way that we have letthings get the business and money withthe short-sighted short-term perspectivethen bonds with the over reductionistways that we approach medicine and thenwe have these bizarre things happen andthese kind of bizarre things and livesright it changed the courses of liveslike fortunately you you know you gotyou got what you needed and you figuredthings out but if you hadn't would youhave the career you have like we don'tknow right or if if someone else hadn'trealized like let's talk to that womanand see what's going on they'll wouldshe have survived I mean we don't wedon't know but the point of that is likelots of bad thingshappen right as we're rolling the dicetoo many times with too many people andit doesn't have to be that way and theway that we're doing it now is not onlyinefficientfinancially right the thing is that weseem to be caring about most it leads tobad outcomes and it also makes no senseright we're looking at it through thissort of bizarre lens then we may findwithin us the strength to change thatand to change it in a way that actuallyfits the science and fits the commonsenseand I have to imagine that both forpeople who require medication in order"

at the pillars and things are notgoing so well and and you see thatwhenever that person has a bipolar manicepisode while things get really reallydamaged and like it's very very hardthey can't recover from that in the waysthey want to then we'd say well let'swe're going to use medicine to help thisright now of course there are otherthings to use behavioral changes forexample right but there's but there's aclear biological role just like we usemedicine to stop seizures right butpeople also have to make sure they'renot super sleep deprived there's anotherpart to it too we can use medicine toprevent bipolar episodes but there'sanother part of self-care involved toobut it's it's a role of medicine rightjust as if anxiety levels aren't comingdown too much say for the person to getat the trauma right they know there's atrauma they've talked around it you knowfor 20 years they know it's beenimpacting them they're not sure how it'shard to go there they're with a trustedtherapist but it's still it's hard toput words to it and now you know they'remaybe having a panic attack right theythink okay let's we can use medicines totake the temperature down to sort ofeither ease that person's Way Forward sothat they can understand something rightthat then provides a resolution in thatpart of the pillar and then you knowthings are set in a better place so sothe biological aspect you know andspecifically here we're talking aboutmedicines has its place but the ideathat medicines are a substitute forunderstandingthis makes no sensewell you've provided us an incredibleframework thank youyou know this framework really speaks toall of us right you know that thecomponents that make us who we are youknow that as youput it the structure of the self youknow everything from the unconsciousmind conscious mind defense mechanismscharacter structure self and thefunctions of selfyou know these components ofself-awareness defense mechanismsreaching up from that Iceberg under thewaterwhat we pay attention to our behaviorsand hopefully our strivings and sense ofhope and how those two pillars flow upinto empowerment humilityagency and gratitude again as actionterms as active termsand eventually to peace contentment andDelight in this notion of generativedrive as well as some of the pitfallsand andum challenges that can pull down ongenerative drive or occlude generativedrive and you very clearly pointed us towhere we should all lookin terms of understanding ourselvesbetter and where we could do better andbe better in the worldbecause this is a series we have thewonderful opportunity toum have you tell us even more about howthis structure plays out both in termsof its healthy expression and in termsof its unhealthy expression you know indifferent pathologic conditions that youknow most of us are familiar with atleast in name and and I'm sure you'regoing to tell us more about you knowwhat the what the realum both underpinnings and expressions

go soum first of all I want to say and thankyou really an immense thank you for foroh you're so welcome for defining thestructure and making it so clear to tome and to everybody else and and as yousaid it it has its complexity there's infact immense complexity down there atthe bottom but thatflows up from complex to to very simpleideals and a road map to get there andagain the PDF is available to people asa link in the show note captions umshould they want to see this in visualform I also want to thank you forassembling the structure not just as atutorial but because at least to myknowledgeno such structureor summary of these structures it existsanywhere in the world and certainly notin any form that the the non-clinicianand not you know highly trainedpsychiatrist could ever access orunderstand so this is both an immenseresource and an immense gift to us allthank you so very much you're so welcomeand thank you for having me here whichis a giftum to be continued in the

    "episode_summary": "This is episode 1 of a 4-part special series on mental health with psychiatrist Dr. Paul Conti, M.D., who trained at Stanford School of Medicine and completed his residency at Harvard Medical School before founding his clinical practice, the Pacific Premiere Group. Dr. Conti defines mental health in actionable terms and describes the foundational elements of the self, including the structure and function of the unconscious and conscious mind, which give rise to all our thoughts, behaviors and emotions. He also explains how to explore and address the root causes of anxiety, low confidence, negative internal narratives, over-thinking and how our unconscious defense mechanisms operate. This episode provides a foundational roadmap to assess your sense of self and mental health. It offers tools to reshape negative emotions, thought patterns and behaviors \u2014 either through self-exploration or with a licensed professional. The subsequent three episodes in this special series explore additional tools to further understand and improve your mental health.\nFor the full show notes, including articles, books, and other resources, visit hubermanlab.com.\nThank you to our sponsors\nAG1:\u00a0https://drinkag1.com/huberman\nBetterHelp: https://betterhelp.com/huberman \nWaking Up: https://wakingup.com/huberman\nMomentous:\u00a0https://livemomentous.com/huberman"
