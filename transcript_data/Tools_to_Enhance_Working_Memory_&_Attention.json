            "text": "discussion by comparing working memoryto other forms of memory that mostpeople are more familiar with or atleast when most people hear the wordmemory they typically are thinking aboutlong-term memory like one's ability toremember the capitals of states orcountries the different continentsdirections from one location to anothereven one's name all of those things areexamples of long-term memory now I wantto emphasize that long-term memoryreally has two components there are whatwe call declarative long-term memoriesso these are the things that we candeclare things like facts aboutourselves or the world or others andthen there are procedural long-termmemories procedural long-term memoriesas the name suggests are aspects of ourmemory that allow us to perform certainprocedures they are literally actionsteps that we take to for instance ridea bicycle or drive a car which by theway we might not be conscious ofourselves doing after we learn that isafter we pass information into ourprocedural long-term memory but evenonce those things become reflexive theyare stored in our long-term memory now adiscussion of long-term memory is notthe focus today but me being aneuroscientist and I like to think youall generally being interested in theunderlying biology I'll just mentionthat there's a key structure within thebrain that is part of a larger neuralnetwork that is a collection ofstructures which is absolutely essentialfor the formation and storage oflong-term memories and that's thehippocampus which in Latin meansseahorse and it does look a little bitlike a seahorse but you actually haveone on each side of your brain so we sayhippocampi plural and so what we know isthat if people have damage to theirhippocampus of any kind that people havetrouble accessing or forming long-termmemory sometimes both and there's a lotmore that we could say about long-termmemory indeed I did an entire episode ofThe hubman Lab podcast about theformation and storage of long-termmemories including some tools to improvelong-term memories we'll touch on a fewof those tools later today but you canaccess that episode if you go to hubmanlab.com and just put memory into thesearch function and you'll find it therein the meantime if we want to understandworking memory we not only have tounderstand how it's different fromlong-term memory but also how it'sdifferent from short-term memoriesshort-term memory is a capacity that weall have that as the name suggestsrepresents a short-term memory bank forinformation that may or may not getpassed into long-term memory so forinstance if you've learned anything andof course you have if you can understandwhat I'm saying you've learned Englishlanguage if you can write you've learnedhow to write Etc well in order to learnthose things and to commit them tolong-term memory the informationrequired to do those things and to havethat knowledge needed to be held inshort-term memory and short-termmemories are the sorts of memories thatwe maintain for somewhere between a fewminutes and potentially a few hoursmaybe a little bit longer but only acertain percentage of that is passedinto our long-term memory so forinstance if you listen to this podcastor you go to a course lecture uh whetheror not that lecture is about cognitivematerial or whether or not it's aboutlearning a new physical skill regardlessof what you learn you're only going tolearn a certain amount of thatinformation but were we to examine howmuch of the information you just heardor that you're hearing now you rememberimmediately after this podcast episodeas compared to say a week later we knowbased on gosh millions of scientificpapers and studies that you are going tohave more information in your short-termmemory stores shortly after beingexposed to new information then you willlater in other words only a smallpercentage of what we perceive what wesee what we hear Etc gets passed intoshort-term memory and then only afraction of that gets passed intolong-term memory now the neural circuitsfor short-term memory and the passage ofshort-term memories into long-termmemory involve a lot of different brainstructures but here again we canimplicate the hip hi campus Because theactual passage of short-term memoriesinto long-term memories occurs in partwithin the hippocampus and then a lot ofpeople don't know this some of thememories that we think of as long-termmemories are actually distributed intothe neocortex which is the outer portionof the brain now the point here is lessto fill your mind with different namesof things and nomenclature but rather toget you thinking about what's involvedin creating short and long-term memoriesand equally important that even thoughthe hippocampus is critically involvedin the formation of short and long-termmemories that the formation of short andlong-term memories is really a networkphenomenon in fact among the moreimportant themes that comes up again andagain on this podcast anytime that we'retalking about Neuroscience or actuallybiology in any case is that rarely ifever is there one location in the brainwhere something happens typically it's anetwork phenomenon meaning it's thecollaboration of a bunch of differentbrain areas passing information from onelocation to the next and storing it in akind of distributed way way now anotherkey thing to understand about working"

            "text": "memory and how it is different fromshort and long-term memory is that theformation of short and long-termmemories almost always involvesneuroplasticity neuroplasticity is thenervous system's ability to change inresponse to experience now there aredifferent types of neuroplasticity sooften when we hear about neuroplasticityin the popular sphere people don'temphasize that there are different typesof neuroplasticity and it's worth payinga little bit of attention to what thosedifferent typ are there is for instancewhat we call long-term potentiationlong-term potentiation or ltp as theacronym goes is the strengthening ofconnections between neurons as aconsequence of their repeated firingvery closely together in time okaythere's a lot more to it but if you'veever heard the phrase fire together wiretogether sometimes that is misattributedto Donald Hebb who did talk aboutneuroplasticity by the way Donald Hebbwas a psychologist up in Canada whotalked about neuroplasticity in thecontext of lots of different forms oflearning but that fire together wiretogether phrase was not actually statedby Donald Hebb it was stated by Carlashatz my colleague at Stanford and shewas referring to ltp but other forms ofneuroplasticity that occur mainly indevelopment when neurons fire veryclosely in time and thereby strengthenthose connections which can include ltpokay so for now think of ltp as anytimethat some small group of neurons couldbe two neuronscould be 2,000 neurons are very activeclosely together in time and they haveaccess to one another physically and theconsequence is often not always but it'soften ltp that is the strengthening ofthose connections such that after thatbarrage of activity subsides thoseneurons can speak to each other they cancommunicate through electrical activityand chemical activity much more easilytheir communication is more robust it'slike removing a wall between a aconversation such that the conversationcan take place more fluidly now thereare other forms of neuroplasticityincluding LTD longterm depression whichunfortunately the name often calls tomind ideas about depression as apsychiatric or a psychological symptombut has nothing to do with thatlong-term depression is simply theinverse of ltp it's actually theweakening or the removal of connectionsthat we call synapses between neurons Iwant to emphasize that both ltp and LTDare both critically involved in lots ofdifferent kinds of learning and both ofthem tend to be involved in theformation of both short-term memoriesand long-term memories and this is veryimportant in the removal of short-termmemories and long-term memoriesliterally forgetting of certain thingsbecause as we all know there are manythings that we will never forget andthere are also things that we almostalways forget now there's a third formof neuroplasticity that's involved inthe formation of short and long-termmemories that's important for us todiscuss just briefly but I do want toemphasize that there are not just threeforms of neuroplasticity there are manyother forms dozens if not more thingslike Spike timing dependent plasticypaired pulse facilitation and on and onbut the third type of neuroplasticitythat I'd like to mention now isneurogenesis neurogenesis is theformation of new neurons nowneurogenesis is robust in the developingnervous system we know this it's robustin the developing nervous system ofanimals and humans however neurogenesisthe literal formation of new neurons inthe brain is a very exciting idea and itdoes occur and it's very exciting in away that has motivated lots of popularpress Outlets to talk about or todiscuss papers that have discoveredneurogenesis in the adult brain becauselet's be honest what's more excitingthan the idea that your brain can addnew brain cells later in life and indeedthat has been shown even in people wellinto their 80s and 90s however it's veryimportant to know that the total amountof neurogenesis that occurs in the adulthuman brain is infantes small as amechanism for neuroplasticity andlearning as compared to the other formsof neuroplasticity that we discussedsuch as long-term potentiation andlong-term depression so I don't want toyou know throw cold water on the topicof neurogenesis it's an incrediblyinteresting and important topic but alltoo often they tend to eclipse the muchmore common mechanism for the formationof short and long-term memories whichare those other forms we just talkedabout ltp LTD Etc so the point here isthat yes indeed there are new neuronsthat can be added in the adult brainmaybe even in the adult human brain andthere is some evidence that some ofthose new neurons are added to thehippocampus in fact a particular regionof the hippocampus called the dentategyrus of the hippocampus and there'sbeen a lot of controversy about how muchneurogenesis occurs or doesn't occur andwhether or not it occurs after pubertyor not there's a whole field of peoplebattling over this now for severaldecades ades but one thing is very clearneurogenesis while it's very excitingand intriguing is not the main mechanismby which the formation of short andlong-term memories occurs when you learnnew information as you are right now thestorage of that information in yourshort-term memory networks which is thenpassed on to your long-term memorynetworks and that can be recalled thatallows you to State certain facts aboutfor instance the existence of this thingcalled a hippocampus hopefully you willremember that going forward or yourability to perform any kind of motormovement that you learned now or wayback inchildhood most of that is theconsequence of the strengthening ofparticular connections and the weakeningof other types of connections those arethe two major forms of neuroplasticityokay so I don't want you to get the"

is I'mactually going to give you a workingmemory test this is the sort of workingmemory test that you would take if youwere to go into a psychology laboratoryor a neuroscience Laboratory and theywere studying working memory in humansnow there's another advantage to usdoing this in real time right here asyou're listening or as you're listeningand watching and that's because you'regoing to get data you're going to getinformation about what your Baselineworking memory capacity is and you'regoing to want to keep those data in yourshort-term memory stores maybe even yourlong-term memory stores but certainlyyour short-term memory stores becauseshortly later in this episode I'm goingto talk about different ways to improveyour working memory depending on whereyour Baseline working memory startswhich by the way turns out to be apretty good proxy for the levels of aneuromodulator called dopamine withinthe neural circuits that control workingmemory so right now let's take a workingmemory task we're going to do thispurely through audio form because Irealize some people are watching andlistening to this on YouTube and othersare just listening to this episode sothere are not going to be any visualcues or slides that I present and that'sperhaps what distinguishes what we're todo most from what would happen in alaboratory typically in a laboratorythere would be some visual presentationof what I'm about to say but herebecause of the format that most of youare consuming this information by we'regoing to do this purely by Audio so thefirst test of your working memory isvery simple I'm going to read off aseries of letters and your task is toremember as many of those letters as youcan the first string of letters is J K kz pi okay just to make this really easy I'mgoing to say it twice although typicallyin a working memory task it would justbe said once but I'm going to make thisextra easy j k z pi okay now you in your own head can tryand recite back those letters if youlike okay second string of letters r r om k le I'm going to make this extra simpleand do it again not typical for aworking memory task but there are someworking memory tasks where that happensr o m k le okay now a third string of lettersthis one's going to be a little bitlonger so queue up that working memoryandattention w a c q v dn I'll repeat that again w a c q v dn how many of the letters I just readcan you remember okay so depending onhow many letters you can rememberperhaps you have a low moderate or highdegree of workingmemory keep in mind that some of you areperhaps doing other things you'reattending to driving or other taskswithin your home or your office and soperhaps you weren't able to pay fullattention so there'll be some variationthere but nonetheless after reading eachof those strings of letters you wereasked to recall those letters in yourmind and if you wrote them down andyou're rereading them yes that'scheating but how about this what if Iwere to ask you now about the simplestfirst string of letters the one thatconsisted of only five letters how manyof you can remember any of those fivelettersnow okay I can't hear you if you'reshouting them out uh I can't see you ifyou're raising your hand but chances aremost of you have forgotten the firstseries of letters even though it wasquite short and you could remember itearly on that ability to remember thatstring of letters when you first heardthem and indeed I read them twice so I'dbe very surprised if any of you couldn'tremember that string of letters afterhearing them twice but I also read yousome other letters in the interim okayso that now just a couple minutes laterI'm asking you to remember that firststring of five letters and assuming thatyou didn't write it down you're notcheating chances are you rememberanywhere from two to zero of thoseletters in that first word which is aperfect example of your working memorynothing got committed to short-term muchless long-term memory rather yourworking memory was able to work withthat information hold it in mind forjust as long as you thought you neededto know that information but then thankgoodness that information was discardedyou didn't know that I was going to askyou for that first string of lettersagain after reading you the longerstring of letters but I did thatdeliberately to show you how yourworking memory works so in some sensethe working memory task is a bit unusualin that it's a test of yes memory in thevery very short term but also a test ofyour ability to forget to discardinformation that's not critical and thatgets us back to the original definitionof working memory which is our abilityto attend to specific small batches ofinformation remember it for just as longas we think we need to and then todiscard that information and by the wayif you want to know what those firstfive letters were they were j k z p iI'd like to take a brief moment andthank one of our sponsors and that's ag1"

            "text": "and the neurochemistry of working memorynow it's important that we do thisbecause in a few minutes you're alsogoing to learn that people generallyfall into two broad bins of having ahigh or low Baseline of a certainneurochemical in the brain that affordsthem either high or low working memorycapacity now in reality it's adistribution in fact it's what we call anormal distribution so it really isn'ttwo bins but during today's discussionand in fact in a lot of laboratorystudies we can actually bin people intothese two groups the neural circuitryunderlying working memory involves a lotof different brain locations that is alot of different neural networkscollaborating to create this thing wecall working memory however there are acouple of key hubs that is locationswithin the brain that are especiallyimportant for working memory the onesthat I'd like to focus focus on todayinvolve the prefrontal cortex so this isneural real estate that resides justbehind the forehead and the neurons inthe brain stem so further back in thebrain that manufacture dopamine and thatsend their little wires that we callaxons up to the prefrontal cortex torelease dopamine dopamine is aneuromodulator many people are familiarwith dopamine and familiar with it inthe context of motivation and drivesometimes people mistakenly think it'sonly involved in pleasure but dopamineis involved in motivation and drive whendopamine systems go Ary that is if theirlevels get too high that can createmanic States it can create addictiveStates when dopamine levels are too lowyou can get movement challenges such asin Parkinson's which is a deficit or aliteral destruction of the neurons thatmanufacture dopamine there are a bunchof different areas of the brain thatthose dopamine neurons in the brain stemproject to but for right now we're goingto focus almost entirely on the dopamineprojections from the brain stem to theprefrontal cortex which is called themisoc cortical circuitry I'm not goingto get into the origins or the meaningof the misoc cortical versus otherdopamine projection systems I did thatin a couple of episodes about ADHD andattention and dopamine in particular andyou can find those at huberman lab.comjust put dopamine and circuits into thesearch function and it will take you tothose particular time stamps where Idescribe that but since we want to keepthings fairly top Contour at the levelof neural circuit here just know thatthere are a bunch of neurons thatmanufacture dopamine back in the brainstem that send their axons those littlewires up to the prefrontal cortex andthat the amount of dopaminereleased per unit time so in a certainamount of time strongly dictates theextent to which working memory capacityis going to be high medium or low now Iwant to be very clear because I'm goingto come back to this a little bit lateragain andagain it is the case that when dopaminelevels are lower that is either thereare fewer neurons that have thepotential to release dopamine in thefrontal cortex or for whatever reasonless is being released in the frontalcortex that working memory performancetends to be lower as compared toconditions where dopamine release or theavailability of dopamine is higherhowever it is not the case that moredopamine is always going to equate toimproved working memory this is soimportant that I'm going to say it againit is not always the case thatincreasing the amount of dopamineTransmission in the frontal cortex leadsto improvements in working memory thereis a specific criteria that allows us topredict whether or not it will improveor maintain or actually degrade workingmemory performance so before you head tothe end of the podcast to try and figureout ways to increase dopamine to improveworking memory please keep that fact inmind don't just commit it to yourworking memory commit it to your shortand long-term memory because that's veryimportant if your goal is to improveyour working memory with that said I dowant to describe just a little littlebit of research showing the relationshipbetween having a low working memory spanas it's called the ability to onlyremember a few letters or numbers orshort batches of information as comparedto a high working memory span meaninglonger strings of letters longer stringsof numbers which of course in the realworld translates to being able to carryout shorter versus longer actionsequences as described earlier in thescenario where you're getting up in themorning and you're making coffee andyou're heading out for run etc etcpeople do differ in terms of theirworking memory capacity and there's aclassic study done by kols and despositoand colleagues this was published in2008 where they had a way to label theamount of dopamine that is available forrelease in the frontal cortex in humansubjects they did this by the injectionof a specific Dy that Dy gets taken upspecifically by the neurons in the brainthat manufacture dopamine then they wereable to image the brains of those peoplewhile those people were Wide Awake usingsomething called positron emissiontomorrow graphy again the specific toolisn't necessarily important but sincesome of you like to know and what theyfound is that for people that had a highworking memory span that is couldremember long strings of numbers orletters or other information they tendedto be the people that had more dopamineavailable for release in the frontalcortex either because they had more ofthe dopamine neurons themselves orsimilar number of neurons but thoseneurons had more dopamine to releaseokay and they also found the converseindividuals that had a low workingmemory span and ability had lessdopamine available for release so thatestablishes a correlation but it's notcausal a different study which is also aclassic was carried out by brazowy Brownroswold and Goldman and this is a reallyimportant study because in this studythey were able to introduce smallamounts of dopamine directly into thecortex and evaluate working memorycapacity now anytime working memory testis done the same pattern always emergesthis is regardless of any dopamine beinginfused into the brain which is peopleand animals for that matter are verygood at remembering short spans ofnumbers letters or other types ofinformation so if you tell them onething like the letter a and then you askthem do you remember the letter almosteverybody remembers that but if you givethem a string of 10 letters theyremember fewer of those 10 lettersthat's sort of obvious but it's animportant point to emphasize nonethelessand so there's a kind of a dropping offcurve of performance as one progressesfrom fewer to Greater number of items tobe remembered in this study whendopamine was introduced to the frontalcortex the number of things thatindividuals could remember simplyincreased it was a very straightforwardresult more dopamine introduced allowedlonger letter number and informationstrings to be remembered and of courseforgotten because that's what workingmemory involves remembering and thendiscarding of information shortlythereafter now the findings I justdescribed complement what I said beforewhich is the naturally occurringexperiment bring people into the labmeasure their working memory span lookat how much dopamine they make higherdopamine better working memory lowerdopamine lower workingmemory the experiment I just describedwas one in which dopamine is introducedshowing that dopamine is very likely therate limiting or the capacity limitingit's probably the better way to put itthe capacity limiting neurom modulatorfor improving working memory that's afancy nerd speaker way of saying moredopamine allows for better workingmemory but a critical feature of thisexperiment is that they did a number ofexperiments where they didn't introducedopamine but instead they introducedother neuromodulators to the prefrontalcortex such asnorepinephrine or serotonin and theinteresting finding is that the additionof norepinephrine or serotonin which ofcourse are other neuromodulators thatcan change the firing patterns ofneurons in the prefrontal cortex butelsewhere as well it's just that in thiscase they were added to the prefrontalcortex had no effect on working memoryit neither improved nor degraded workingmemory when those neuromodulators wereintroduced in other words dopamine andperhaps only dopamine seems to be thedominant neuromodulator for regulatingthe degree that is whether or not youhave small medium or large amounts ofworking memory capacity in theprefrontal cortex and of course therehave been a bunch of other experimentsthat are worth mentioning briefly inthis context such as taking people thathave a high working memory capacity andindeed have their brains imaged and onesees that they have high levels ofBaseline dopamine especially thedopamine projecting to the prefrontalcortex and then they're given a drugthat depletes dopamine within theprefrontal cortex and their performancedrops and so what's so nice about theliterature around working memory is thatwhile I'm not covering all of thatliterature exhaustively it all tends toJive it all points in a directionwhereby the levels of of dopamine beingreleased in the prefrontal cortex duringworking memory tasks correlates verystrongly with capacity to performworking memory tasks lower dopaminelower working memory span as it's calledhigher dopamine higher working memoryspan okay so next we're going to do"

memorycapacity is and by extension yourBaseline levels of dopamine or at leastthe levels of dopamine that are likelybeing released into your prefrontalcortex while you do these working memorytasks in other words we're going to tryand figure out whether or not you are ofthe low medium or high working memorycapacity and of course we're doing thatin part to try and establish whether ornot you likely have low medium or highamounts of dopamine available forrelease in the prefrontal cortex ofcourse we're not putting you into apositron Omission tomography scanningdevice we aren't able to do that forobvious reasons but keep in mind thatwhat we about to do is very similar andin some cases identical to laboratorystudies where the researchers weretrying to determine what people's levelsof dopamine within these particularneural networks we've been discussingthe misoc cortical pathway are likely tobe in other words performance on TheWorking memory task that we are about todo is a decent indication of what thedopamine levels that are available forrelease in your prefrontal cortexperhaps might be now I say perhaps mightbe because I don't want to cause anyunnecessary alarm if for instance youfall into the low working memory spangroup in fact if you fall into the lowworking memory span group there areactually some terrific tools that youcan use to improve dopamine Transmissionin those Pathways and improve yourworking memory I also don't want peopleto get the impression that somehowperformance on this working memory taskis reflective of some larger dopamineissue in the brain and certainly it isnot I repeat it is not diagnostic ofParkinson's or any kind of neurod deenergenerative condition although I will saythat deficits in working memory arecommon in patients with Parkinson forobvious reasons those patients havedeficits in dopamine neurons not onlyproduction but the number of dopamineneurons it's one of the Hallmarkfeatures of Parkinson's but also inthings like traumatic brain injury Etcbut the working memory task that you'reabout to take when given to a generalpopulation or a group of undergraduatesor you know so-called normals or typicalcontrol subjects which all of you areokay so unless you're dealing with witha traumatic brain injury or you know youhave Parkinson's we know that the datathat you're going to get back right nowis very similar to the data that peopleget back when they do these sorts ofstudies in a laboratory that is it'stypical for some people to have a shortworking memory span some people to havea medium working memory span and somepeople that have a high working memoryspan and today we're actually just goingto divide into two bins short workingmemory span and high working memory spanand we can have some degree ofconfidence that correlates with theamount of dopamine available for releasein the front Al cortex but and this is avery important Point as we progressalong this discussion of working memorythe neural circuits dopamine Etc I wantto make clear something that I saidearlier which is that it is not the casethat increasing the amount of dopaminethat's available always increasesworking memory spin in fact there's acommon circumstance whereby people witha relatively High degree of workingmemory capacity increase their dopaminelevels even further using pharmacologyor other methods that we'll discuss andtheir per performance actually candegrade okay so if any of that isconfusing now we'll make it all verysimple going forward so that if youdecide to implement any of the protocolsdiscussed in this episode that you areaware of what you can expect and whetheror not you in the category of peoplethat should or perhap should notincorporate those protocols okay let'stest your working memory again this timethe working memory task is going to be alittle bit different than the one youdid previously this working memory taskinvolves me reading six differentsentences to you and your job is to payattention to these six sentences becauseyou're going to be asked someinformation about these sentences in afew moments the first sentence is realestate costs are goingup the second sentence is the AtlanticOcean is warm insummer the third sentence is there's alot of interest now in electriccars the fourth sentence is somereptiles eat only one once ayear the fifth sentence is kids nowadayslook at screens more than 60% of theirWakingLife and the sixth and final sentence isfootball can mean different sportsdepending on thecountry okay so I read you six sentencesthey were moderately long I confess yourjob for the working memory task is nowto recall as many of the final words ofeach of those sentences as you can I'llgive you a few moments to do that nowbefore I tell you what the final word ofeach of those sentences actually is Iwant to remind everybody that workingmemory capacity follows a normaldistribution so some of you will be ableto remember the final word of perhapsfive or even six of those sentencesalthough I must say that is exceedinglyrare some of you are going to be able toremember three to four of the finalwords of those sentences and that's moretypical that actually represents theaverage or the mean as we call it andthen fewer people although still many ofyou will only be able to remember one ortwo of the final words of thosesentences okay so now I'm assuming thatmost of you have tried to call to memorythe final word of as many of those sixsentences as you can and maybe you'vewritten them down or you've typed theminto your phone or you have some recordof what you recall those six final wordsof those sentences are now I'm going totell you the actual final word of eachof those sentences the final word of thefirst sentence was up because as you mayrecall the sentence was real estatecosts are going up the final word of thesecond sentence was summer because thesentence was the Atlantic Ocean is warmin summer the final word of the thirdsentence was Cars because the sentencewas there is a lot of interest inelectric cars the final word of thefourth sentence was year because thesentence was some reptiles eat only oncea year the final word of the fifthsentence was life because the sentencewas kids nowadays look at screens morethan 60% of their Waking Life and thefinal word of the sixth sentence wascountry because the sentence wasfootball can mean different sportsdepending on the country okay so behonest with yourself and tell yourselfand you don't have to tell anyone elseif you don't want to how many of thefinal words of those six sentences youcould remember correctly it's importantthat you remember them correctly againthe number of words that you can recallthat is your working memory span isgoing to vary from person to person butwe can take the normal distribution ofthose scores and sort of draw a linedown the middle and say that if youcould remember three to six of the finalwords of those sentences correctlyyou're going to fall into the highworking memory span group whereas if youcould only remember one or two or maybezero of the final words of those sixsentthen you're going to be in the lowworking memory span group again I don'twant to alarm anybody this doesn't meanthat you have any Global memory deficitsor dopamine deficits but it is importantespecially if you plan to apply any ofthe protocols to improve working memorythat you Faithfully that is youaccurately report your working memoryperformance at least to yourself now asyou recall whether or not you have lowor high and here we are just binninginto low and high there's no mediumwe've divided right at that line we'resaying if you can remember 3 to sixwe're calling that high working memoryspan at least for this discussion and ifyou can remember fewer than three evendown to zero of the final words of thosesentences that's low working memory spanwe're dividing it in two we divided youinto two groups and we do know when thishas been done in large numbers of humansubjects and some in some cases all ofthose subjects have their brains imagedfor the amount of dopamine available forrelease in their prefrontal cortex thatshort workking memory span correlateswith lower amounts of dopamine whereashigher working memory span or longerworking memory span whatever you want tocall it correlates with more dopamineavailable for release in the prefrontalcortex now this is where things getreally interesting and frankly really"

ADHD andare struggling to maintain focus andattention and carry out working memorytasks throughout their normal everydaylife not in the laboratory but justmoving through life because these dayswe hear a lot a lot a lot about peoplestruggling with focus and attentionperhaps we don't know perhaps in partdue to overuse of smartphone socialmedia Etc although there's not yet adirect causal relationship that's beenestablished the data that are emergingsuggests that indeed overuse of thosethings can cause problems but regardlessof the source there does seem to be moreADHD both in kids and in adults andsubclinical challenges in focus andattention and here's where things getreally interesting as it relates to theneural circuitry work from desposito andcolleagues and other Laboratories aswell have shown using the similarParadigm that I described before givingpeople drugs to increase their Baselinelevels of dopamine above their initialstarting point of short or long-termmemory span capacity and then had peoplecan perform different types of workingmemory tasks that tap into two differentaspects of attention in working memoryup until now we've been talking aboutworking memory it's kind of just onething but working memory actuallyinvolves two things or at least twothings the first is that in order tocarry out a working memory task into toattend to something to really focus weneed the ability to rule out distractorswe need to be able to not pay attentionto things that would otherwise distractUs in addition to that we need to beable to switch from one context to thenext right making the cup of coffee toputting on one shoes and heading out thedoor and in some cases layeringdifferent contexts together talking onthe phone while tying one shoes and soon and so forth what this work shows usis that the ability to task switch andcontext switch that is to shift aroundwhat it is that we're paying attentionto and interleave different things thatwe're paying attention to somethingthat's so critical for moving throughour daily lives is largely dependent onthe dopamine projections to a structurein the brain called the basil gangliawhich is a structure I've talked aboutbefore on this podcast but if you didn'thear about it we can just broadly Definethis structure as being involved inmovement generation and stoppingmovement generation in fact it's oftendiscussed as the neural circuitry thatgenerates go as in do commands and noodon't do commands so the basil gangliaare involved in task switching and theyinvolved in task switching in part bysending certain commands to go docertain things and no go to not do otherthings okay task switching stop doingthis start doing that start doing thatstop doing this and sometimes to varyingextents right I mean we could take anyreal world scenario of tying one shoeswhile talking on the phone and we couldmicro analyze it in the context of thisbut I think uh if you think about itjust a little bit you understand that inorder to perform daily task we need tobe able to task switch and that's notalways a start one task end start a newtask end often times we're interleavingdifferent tasks to varying degrees nowthe other aspect of working memory andattention is to eliminate distractionsto not pay attention to the irrelevantstuff in one's environment or even theirrelevant stuff on your own body likeyou can't get distracted by you know abutton that you know might be onlypartially buttoned or maybe some littlesomething on your sleeve if you'retrying to do something else at thatmoment okay and people with ADHD andpeople who have subclin clinicalchallenges and focus really have a hardtime with this right you know the thesort of stereotype is you know the ohlook a squirrel that whole thing butreally this typically exists as a moresubtle and challenging phenomenon forpeople where they either can't rememberwhat they were doing or they're simplydrawn down different trajectoriesdifferent thought trajectories or actiontrajectories and then they have a hardtime making it back to the originalthing that they were trying to focus onand we know based on these studies ofdopamine and neuroimaging thateliminating distractors is largely theconsequence of dopamine neuronsprojecting to the prefrontal cortex okaynow why am I telling you all this neuralcircuitry stuff well yes there are abunch of studies showing that if youselectively activate the neurons thatsend dopamine into the basil ganglia youimprove Tas switching ability without animproved ability to rule out distractorsor if you selectively increase theamount of dopamine from neuronsprojecting the prefrontal cortex thatyou're able to selectively improve theelimination of dist tractors withoutimproving task switching ability forpractical purposes in this discussion wewant to pay careful attention to whetheror not the data tell us that thoseparticular protocols those particularapproaches are globally increasingdopamine that is increasing the activityof dopamine neurons projecting to thebasil ganglia and the prefrontal cortexor selectively to the basil ganglia orselectively to the prefrontal cortex andwhat I can tell you now is thatfortunately there are several prot someof which are behavioral some of whichinvolve specific over-the-countersupplements and some of which involveprescription pharmacology that can tapinto each of these systems independentlyas well as globally increased dopamineto improve focus and working memory atlarge I'd like to take a quick break toacknowledge our sponsor element element"

entireepisodes devoted to optimizing andregulating dopamine and of coursedopamine comes up within the context ofthe ADHD episodes and episodes as welland again if you have specific questionsabout dopamine or any other topic forthat matter if you go to hubermanlab.com that website has been engineeredso that you can put one word such asdopamine but also multiple keywords soperhaps dopamine exercise or dopaminecold plunge Etc into the search functionand it will take you to the specifictimestamps of multiple episodes wherethose topics were discussed as well asnewsletters where some of thatinformation has been condensed intoshort PDF form Etc so we certainly aregoing going to cover some material aboutimproving dopamine for sake of improvingworking memory now but if you'regenerally interested in the science andpharmacology of dopamine and protocolsto modulate dopamine levels all of thatcan be found at huberman lab.com okay solet's say you have a short workingmemory span or a moderate working memoryspan and you want to experiment withincreasing levels of dopamine for sakeof improving working memory now thereare a lot of different ways that onecould imagine doing that let's startwith the behavioral tools known toincrease dopamine stores that is shownin peer-reviewed studies to increasedopamine stores within certain circuitsof the brain that are relevant forworking memory performance and theprotocol that immediately leaps to mindis the use of certain non-sleep deeprest protocols now non-sleep deep restor nsdr is actually a term that I coinedbecause there is a practice that's beenestablished for many hundreds of yearscalled Yoga Nidra which actually meansyoga sleep whereby individualspotentially you if you decide to do themlie down listen to to a script that islisten to an audio script whichgenerally instructs you to do longexhale breathing to deliberately relaxyour musculature of your face and ofyour body and Yoga Nidra typically alsoinvolves doing certain intentions andthe instruction always given at thebeginning of Yoga Nidra is that youshould try to not fall asleep now somepeople sometimes fall asleep some peopledon't fall asleep but the idea and thereare data to support that Yoga Nidra putspeople into kind of a shallow pattern ofsleep um certainly not deep sleep s andnot rapid eye movement sleep but it's avery interesting and unusual brain statefor which we're starting to understandmore and actually I have some plans inthe not too distant future tocollaborate with Matthew Walker theauthor of the book why we sleep and someother colleagues to try and figure outwhat exact patterns of neural activityare taking place in the brain and restof nervous system during Yoga Nidra andthis similar protocol which I callnonsleep deep rest the differencebetween Yoga Nidra and non-sleep deeprest is that nonsleep deep rest doesn'tinclude any of the intentions andremoves a lot of the kind of opaque orsometimes called mystical language fromthe protocol now a great thing is thatyoga needra scripts or protocols as wellas nsdr scripts or Protocols areavailable totally zero cost you can findthem certainly on apps like waking upbut also on YouTube for instance if youput nsdr and my last name there's a10-minute nsdr script there there are alot of yoga NRA scripts if you prefer afemale voice there are a lot ofdifferent excellent female voices outthere one in particular particular thatI like very much is Kelly boy first nameKelly last name b y s she has both yogaNRA and ndr scripts of various durationsof anywhere from 8 minutes all the wayout to I believe 45 minutes why am Itelling you all this well there havebeen several studies but in particularone and I do realize we're talking aboutonly one study but the results arereally intriguing as it relates to whatwe're talking about today in this studythey had individuals do effectively annsdr protocol they call it yoganidra andthe protocol they used was essentially ayoga Nedra script they had people liedown and listen to a yoga Nedra scriptand to perform yoga Nedra and theyevaluated the amount of dopamineavailable within the brain both prior toand after performing this yoga NRAscript and what they discovered was thatafter performing a Yoga Nidra protocolthe Baseline levels of dopamine that isthe amount of dopamine available in thebasil ganglia and a few other structuresof the human brain of course these arehumans was increased by as much as60% as compared to individuals that dida different protocol not yoganidra notnsdr now did that study evaluate lots ofdifferent durations of yoga Nedra AKAnstr no they looked at fairly long hourplus Yoga Nidra sessions however there'ssome other data that have explored YogaNidra AKAnstr in the context of cognitiveperformance and a few othercircumstances all of which point to thefact that cognitive performance and inparticular cognitive performance tasksthat have a working memory element tothem so they weren't the exact workingmemory task that you did earlier butthey have a working memory element tothem that is subjects had to keepcertain small batches of information inmind and then discard that informationin order to be able to perform the taskwell all of those show significantimprovements in task performance sowhile something like nsdr or Yoga Nidramight sound kind of mystical or kind ofyou know wishy-washy or I guess as thekids say weak sauce uh to some of you itis anything but weak sauce it is reallypowerful stuff and it's powerful stuffas it relates to the very neurochemicalsand neuros circuits that are involved inworking memory so if I were to take astep back and just say okay what aresome zeroc cost very low if any riskprotocols that one could perform inorder to improve dopamine levels withouthaving to ingest anything take anythingand really do much of anything at allexcept lie there do this progressivemuscle relaxation there are a few otherthings involved in nsdr as well whichyou'll learn if you decide to try themand improve or increase the levels ofdopamine availability in the brainsignificantly well then nsdr and YogaNidra really are the first line tools ifone wants to do that I think it'sreasonable to say that and as Imentioned before there's no reason tothink that there's any risk of doingnstr yoga NRA you know provide thatyou're lying down in a safe place asopposed to like in the middle of theroad or something but assuming you do itin a safe location I would encourage youto try it for really for 20 to 30minutes when you first explore itperhaps you do longer although Ipersonally have a hard time doing longyoga needer scripts regularly a fullhour is a big commitment I don'tgenerally have that much time I oftenwill do a 10-minute nsdr have there beenbrain Imaging experiments done for eachand all of these yoga needra scripts todetermine the amount or if there's anydopamine increase within the brain nobut I think that we can safelyextrapolate from that wonderful studyout of Scandinavia that showed that whenhuman subjects do this yoga NRA protocolthat there's a significant increase inBaseline dopamine levels within

            "text": "taking a cold shower or provided you cando it safely getting into a cold oceanor a cold lake can significantly maybeeven double or even triple yourcirculating dopamine levels and indeedthat is true it has been shown that whenpeople get into cold water typically upto their neck and that cold water by theway can range in temperature anywherefrom low 40s to low 60s depending on howlong you stay in that there is asignificant increase in the so-calledcirculating catac colomines what are thecatac colomines the catamin are dopaminenorepinephrine and epinephrine now theevidence for the catac colomine increasein response to cold water mainly stemsfrom two studies and in particular oneand in that particular study they hadpeople get into I wouldn't say supercold water it was in the low 60\u00b0 and bythe way I'm speaking in Fahrenheit hereand they had those human subjectssubmerged in water up to their neck Ithink they actually had them sitting inlawn chairs on the bottom of a pool uhbut again their heads were above waterso they could breathe and they stayed infor quite a long while you know 45minutes or longer and it was observedthat there was a big big statisticallysignificant increase in epinephrinenorepinephrine in dopamine that lastedseveral hours or more this is one of thereasons why if you've ever donedeliberate cold exposure as it's calledit often is uncomfortable when you getin but then when you get out you feeldifferent you feel really good in mostcases provided if you're me you take awarm shower afterwards yes I like to dothat I realize if you want to increaseyour metabolism perhaps it's better tonot warm up afterwards I like a nicewarm shower or to get in the saunaafterwards that's just me butnonetheless deliberate cold exposureclearly induces a state shift of mindand body that most people provided theydo it correctly and they don't go intowater that's far too cold for them fortoo long they report as pleasant and Ithink it's reasonable to assume thatsome of that is the consequence of theseincreases in catac colomines which iswhy many people opt for a cold showerwhich if you're me cold shower followedby a warmer or hot shower or a coldPlunge in the morning or maybe even justonce or twice a week many people likethem typically people like getting outof them and the feeling that they haveafter they do them although some of yousickos really like the feeling ofgetting in and being it but not me thepoint here is that if we were to take alook at the landscape of zeroc costbehavioral Tools in fact behavioraltools that could potentially save youmoney meaning reduce your heating billthat are known to increase the veryneurochemicals AKA dopamine that areinvolved and improving working memory Ithink it's reasonable to assume that acold shower about 30 to 60 minutes priorto doing any kind of working memory taskor any kind of activity that wouldrequire increased Focus could be okay wedon't know this specific Studies havenot been done but could be in theory itmakes sense mechanistically it'slogicallysound could be done after deliberatecold exposure and indeed many peoplereport not just feeling a bit of youknow mild Euphoria or feeling good afterdeliberate cold exposure but also anincreased capacity to focus in fact somuch so that a lot of people who dodeliberate cold exposure say that theydon't require as much caffeine in orderto maintain their alertness and energywhich shouldn't be surprising to us atall right I mean it's increasing cacolameans we know this so that's anotherprotocol that you could explore as wellis there an important difference or notbetween deliberate cold exposure done bycold shower or deliberate cold exposurein a cold plunge or the ocean franklythere haven't been a lot of studiescomparing those but I think it stands toreason that if you have access to a coldplunge or a cold body of water that youcan safely get into up to your neck for30 seconds to a minute if it's 50\u00b0 orless right if you get in colder water weknow for instance if you get into say 45Dee water and you only get in for 30seconds you're going to get a bigincrease in the catacol amines perhapsas big as the catacol amine increasethat you would get from being in 60\u00b0water for 45 minutes most people don'thave 45 minutes to sit around in waterup to their neck so most people opt for30 seconds to as much as 3 minutesdeliberate cold exposure in a shower orcold plunge or other body of water againonly do this if you can do it safelynever ever please for the love of Godplease never ever do any kind ofhyperventilation breathing or breathholding while doing deliberate coldexposure because you can pass out youcan die don't combine breath work anddeliberate cold exposure just don'tseparate those two things completelyokay but deliberate coal exposure weknow is a very reliable way to increasethe catacol amines which includesdopamine so if you want to exploredeliberate cold exposure protocols getinto the Nuance of temperature andduration Etc you can find thatcompletely zero cost go to hubmanlab.com go to the menu tab scroll downto newsletter and go to the coldexposure news letter where it detailsall of that in short PDF form now someof you are probably asking hey what if Iwas in the high or long working memoryspan group I ought to have high Baselinelevels of dopamine should I not do YogaNidra or nsdr should I not do deliberatecold exposure well there you're justgoing to have to experiment againthere's essentially zero risk to doingyoganidra nsdr as I mentioned beforedeliberate cold exposure there's alwayssome risk getting into water cold waterpeople always want to know how cold wellthe newsletter gets to this but I'lljust tell you right now as well theideal temperature is the temperaturethat you can safely get into and stay infor a duration of 30 seconds to 3minutes before getting out some peopleop to go longer but I think 30 secondsto 3 minutes is a good duration to workwith for most people especially ifyou're going to do it frequently so thetemperature should be safe for you tostay in for that duration butuncomfortable enough that there's someimpulse to want to get out that you haveto of work to stay in there that youhave to kind of overcome that adrenalinerelease and the impulse to get out okayso for some people that's going to be45\u00b0 for some people be 40\u00b0 depends onhow cold adapted you are depends on howrested you are there is no specifictemperature you have to really gauge foryourself and so airor on the side ofcaution and you can experiment providedyou experiment within the margins ofsafety so if you found during theworking memory task that you took todaythat you have a very good working memoryI don't think there's any reason toavoid yoganidra nsdr and deliberate coldexposure in fact there may be reasons toincrease your dopamine and other catacolamines by way of nsdr Yoga Nidradeliberate cold exposure perhaps forworking memory performance maybe itcould increasefurther perhaps it would decreaseperformance in which case there you gotyour answer you don't have to do thoseprotocols again and you certainlywouldn't want to do them before anythingthat involves a lot of working memoryand attention but of course thoseprotocols have other benefits as well sothere's no reason to avoid them entirelyjust perhaps avoid them within thecontext of trying to improve workingmemory however if you're somebody thathas challenges with working memorychallenges with attention challengeswith Focus well then I think that theprotocols I've been talking about upuntil now would be an excellent firstforay into the sorts of things that youcould do to increase dopamine and ofcourse those other catacol amines as away to see whether or not it augmentsyour focus and attention and workingmemory capacity now some of you areprobably shouting shouting shouting whatabout exercise does an exercise increasedopamine it does yes there are otherthings that increase dopamine it's notjust exercise there are activities thatincrease dopamine some people are sayingwait doesn't playing video gamesincrease dopamine sex increases dopaminechocolate increases dopamine yes yesindeed those things can increasedopamine what's interesting andimportant about the protocols I've beentalking about however nsdr yoga Nedradeliberate cold exposure is not justthat they increase dopamine but theduration over which they increasedopamine okay this is very important ifyou want to

            "text": "compounds that are known to increasecirculating dopamine that canpotentially improve working memory andthat indeed have been shown inpeer-reviewed studies to improve workingmemory by way of increasing circulatingpresumably brain levels of dopamine wellI can think of two specific categoriesof supplements that is over-the-countercompounds that at least at this point intime are legal in the United States thatcan increase dopamine levels those twoare El tyrosine which is an amino acidprecursor to dopamine and Muna purineswhich is a believe it or not it's the uha velvety Bean or the outer component ofthis velvety Bean that contains or isequivalent to99% lopa L Doopa is a key component inthe biochemical Cascade leading to theproduction of dopamine in fact lopa isoften prescribed for Parkinson patientsas a means to increase their dopaminelevels there are at least three studiesthat I am aware of of the use of Munapurines to increase dopamine for thetreatment of Parkinson's in other wordsMuna purines increases dopamine levelsand yes it has been shown to improvesome of those symptoms of Parkinson'spatients we're not talking abouttreatment of Parkinson's today I want tocaution people against any sort of useof supplements to treat Parkinson's orother conditions without consulting yourdoctor all right that's very verycritical to point out if we're talkingabout ways to increase dopamine for sakeof improving working memory by way ofsupplementation I think we should startwith El tyos because El tyrosine unlikeMuna Pines is a bit further up actuallyit's way further up the biochemicalCascade leading to dopamine productionhowever it has been shown in severalstudies that El tyrosine supplementationcan indeed increase dopamine andmoreover and here I'm quoting the titleof a study published in 1999 which Irealized is a few years back but ofcourse there's some excellent studiesfrom a few years back or more tyrosineimproves working memory in amultitasking environment now thisparticular study from Thomas at all hassome interesting aspects and someaspects that made me go a little bitwide-eyed but not necessarily wide-eyedbecause the results are so dramatic infact when one looks at all of the datain this paper what you find is thatsupplementing with El tyrosine as theydid in this study did indeed lead toimprovements in working memory undermultitask conditions as the titlesuggests those improvements weresignificant but they weren't enormousokay they were statistically significantbut they were not enormous increases nowwhat was enormous and the reason I gotwide-eyed and still get wide-eyed isthat the dosages of of tyrosine used inthe study are really big they hadsubjects take 150 milligrams perkilogram of el crystalline tyrosine Ihad them take it in applesauce forwhatever reason or Placebo and they dida number of different control conditionsto make sure that whatever effects of eltyrosine they observed were in fact dueto El tyrosine supplementation why am Igoing wide-eyed When I See This 150milligrams per Kilof tyrosine well I weigh 220 lb that'sabout 100 kg so if I weigh 100 kilg andit's 150 milligram for every kilogramthat means that if I were a subject inthe study that they would give me 15,000milligram that is 15 gram of el tyrosineprior to doing these cognitive tasks now15 grams of tyrosine to me seems like avery very high dose and I frankly can'tin good conscience recommend that whywell maybe I'm just hypers sensitive toEl tyroine but I've taken 1,000 or500milligrams of el tyrosine and I'vedefinitely experienced an increase inalertness from taking 1.5 gram not 151.5 grams of el tyrosine and in fact ata subjective level I can feel ameaningful increase in alertness andfocus from 500 milligrams of el tyrosineso I can't in good conscience suest thatpeople replicate the exact do protocolswithin the study nonetheless the studyas the title suggests shows thatsupplementing with El tyrosine canindeed increase working memory capacityespecially in a multitasking environmentwhich in many ways carries over to thesorts of requirements for working memoryand attention capacity to get throughlife in a very focused for lack of abetter word way in a very regimented dothis do that task switch multiple thingsinter Lea that's what moving throughone's day or at least work day oranything that requires cognition andfocus entails so first of all I'll justsay what I always say when discussingany kind of compound or prescriptiondrug never add or remove any supplementfrom your supplement regimen if you haveone without consulting with your healthprovider first to make sure that you aresafe to take that particular supplementnow many Physicians MDS are not familiarwith most supplements so you'll probablyneed to bring some literature um to thephone call or to the visit but of coursethere are many Healthcare Providersincluding some MDS that are open tosupplementation especially these days umas supplements have become uh I wouldsay generally more accepted I mean thereare certain ones like vitamin D3 thatand fish oils and things like that thatare more common than El tyrosine butthere are many Physicians who are opento discussions about supplements such asEl tyrosine if you know that you cansupplement with El tyrosine safely andyou opt to do so what dosages would youpotentially take well here we have tolook at the dosages used in thesestudies I think it's only fair it's onlysafe that we acknowledge that these dosejust are really really high and I thinkthe logical the safe thing to do wouldbe to start with the minimal effectivedose so if you weigh 50kilograms rather than start right offwith you know the equivalent dosage tothis study maybe you start with 250milligrams of el tyrosine if you weigh abit more like me or 100 kgrs or 75 kilgmaybe you take 500 milligrams of eltyrosine and see whether or not youexperience a significant effect onworking memory attention and performanceso the idea here is to establish theminimal effective dose I should alsopoint out that some people not all butsome people experience a bit of a crashafter El tyrosine supplementation suchthat they feel more alert more focusedbetter ability to perform working memorytasks move about their day but thenthree or four hours later experiencekind of a drop so you need to be mindfulof that in fact you need to be mindfulof any kind of pharmacology where you'reincreasing dopamine this is one of thereasons why I like the behavioralprotocols that we talked about earlierbecause they're known to create big butlong lasting and slowly tapering offincreases in dopamine and other catacolamines now for those who are curiousabout and perhaps even want to try Munapurines please absolutely talk to yourdoctor first Muna perin is essentiallythe equivalent of lopa lopa is aprescription drug as I mentioned beforeand Muna perin potently increasesdopamine what dosages of Muna Pines canincrease dopamine well typically instudies of Parkinson's patients but alsostudies exploring typical people whodon't have Parkinson's in tasks or insports performance have exploredanywhere from 1 to 5 gr of Muna purinsMuna purin again is a very potent way toincrease dopamine and here if yourhealthc care provider approves it andyou decide to try it I would suggeststarting with a very very low dose againto to find the minimal effective dose somaybe even just 500 milligrams not evengoing to the one gram dose maybe even250 milligrams and really evaluating howmuch Muna pance can produce a meaningfulimpact on working memory and attentionfor you so Muna pan is kind of a bridgebetween over-the-counter supplements and"

            "text": "prescription drugs I say it's a bridgebecause it is Oho similar to thatprescription drug L Doopa and of coursethere is a long list of prescriptiondrugs that are known to be dopamineAgonist several of which many of whichin fact have been shown to improveworking memory you already learned aboutone of those before which isbromocryptine now you need aprescription from a physician to getbromocryptine but bromocryptine we knowbased on that work from despositocolleagues that I talked about earlierincreases dopamine it does so in about90 minutes it achieves Peak levels ofdopamine about 90 minutes and improvesworking memory in individuals that startoff with a low working memory span andwe know from neuroimaging those are theindividuals with lower Baseline levelsof dopamine so should you run out andask your doctor for bromocryptine maybemost doctors won't prescribebromocryptine for that reason I shouldmention that work from desposito lab andother Laboratories has shown that one ofthe Hallmark features of traumatic braininjury especially frontal lobe injury aswell as certain neurod degenerativeconditions like Parkinson's but otherforms of dementia as well as ADHDinvolve deficits in working memory andattention which makes sense given whatwe know about the symptoms of thoseconditions and that bromocryptine hasbeen prescribed off Lael for thetreatment of those conditions to somedegree of success however those are offLael circumstances right now as far as Iknow bromocryptine is not prescribedspecifically for those conditions at akind of whole population level it's notone of the drugs on the lookup table forADHD or TBI but certain well-informedneurologists and Physicians do prescribeit for that reason there are otherdopamine agonists that are relevant inthis context the ones that I think mostof you will be familiar with are thedrugs that increase dopamine andnorepinephrine for the treatment of ADHDand I did an entire episode of Thehubman Lab podcast about those compoundsthings like adderal things like rellinwhich by by the way is quite differentthan Aderall in terms of how muchdopamine relative to norepinephrine itcauses the increase of I cover all thatin those episodes again you can simplygo to hubman lab.com put ADHD Aderall orADHD riddlin and I talk about otherthings as well I also took a little bitabout modafanil which is a entirelydifferent category of drug known toimprove cognitive performance in somecases in ADHD but in everybody so thereare a lot of different drugs that canimprove working memory most of those doso by increasing transmission ofdopamine or availability of dopaminesomehow changing dopamine levels in thebrain by increasing them so if you'resomebody that has challenges withworking memory focus and attentionplease see those episodes and pleasetalk to your doctor about potentiallyusing pharmacology to increase dopaminehowever and this is very important manypeople who have challenges with Focusattention and working memory and fallunder the category of subclinical levelsof ADHD and even some individuals with88 she young and old manage theirsymptoms and in some cases improve theirfocus through the use of Behavioraltools nutritional tools supplement basedTools in ways that either allow them toreduce their total prescription drugdosages and in some cases come off thementirely now I am definitely not sayingthat people should come off those drugsentirely and in fact I want to take areally firm stand here because I knowthis is a bit controversial but I'm justgoing to tell you having evaluated thewhole literature several times over nowI do think I personally believe thatthere is a strong case for certainchildren and adults to take thesecompounds that increase dopamine andepinephrine yes those compounds aredifferent forms of amphetamine but thosecompounds we know can increaseneuroplasticity the rewiring ltp LTD Etcwithin the neural circuits that controlFocus attention and working memory andso they do have their place for certainindividuals we don't want to rule thoseout are they over prescribed my feelingis that yes they are probablyoverprescribed however there are anumber of individuals that stronglybenefit from them as well so if you aregoing to explore the use of thosecompounds for sake of improving workingmemory certainly if you're going toexplore them for sake of improvingworking memory and focus in young kidsplease please please talk to yourphysician because they're prescriptiondrugs you would need to talk to aphysician anyway but regardless ofwhether or not you're trying to improvefocus and working memory in a child inan adult someone with TBI someone withParkinson'sI think it stands to reason that youwould arrive to that conversation withsome knowledge of not just theprescription drugs that are potentiallyavailable but also some of thesupplement based tools some of thebehavioral tools because as we know andas a good friend of mine who's anexcellent physician says Better LivingThrough Chemistry still requires BetterLiving meaning yes prescription drugscan have a positive impact on theseaspects of brain function in a way thatcan really improve lives but thatbehavioral tools also work in fact theycan collaborate in a very synergisticway to increase the amount ofneuroplasticity in the relevant circuitsso I'm of the mind and I think more andmore people out there I like to thinkare of the mind that behaviors nutritionsupplement based tools and prescriptiondrugs all can have their place tovarying degrees depending on thecircumstances and the individual okay sotoday we talked about working memorythis incredible capacity of our brain infact a specific set of brain circuitsdesigned for us to absorb absorbinformation that is perceived in ourenvironment use the relevant parts andthen Chuck it just get rid of it forgetit so very different than short andlong-term memory which we also discussedand we talked about a few of themechanisms as well I think you'll agreethat working memory is one of the moreincredible aspects to brain function Imean if you think about this is a set ofneural circuits that engage the samealgorithm over and over in differentcontext in order for us to be able tonavigate new environments familiarenvironments to interleave differentactivities these different strategies totask switch to rule out distractors it'soh so critical to every aspect of ourWaking Life and fortunately there arealso zeroc cost and lowcost
