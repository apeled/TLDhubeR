            "text": "Andrew Huberman: [Music Playing] Welcome to the Huberman LabGuest Series, where I and an expert\nguest discuss  science and sciencebased tools for everyday life.I'm Andrew Huberman, and I'm a Professor\nof Neurobiology and Ophthalmologyat Stanford School of Medicine.Today marks the third episode\nin our four episode seriesabout mental health with Dr.Paul Conti.Today's episode deals with the topic\nof healthy relationships, how todefine what a healthy relationship\nis, and how to achieve healthyrelationships of all kinds, including\nromantic relationships, interpersonalrelationships at work, friendships with\nfamily, and of course, with oneself.This episode builds on the framework\nof the psychology of self and mentalhealth that was established in the first\nand second episodes of this series.However, even if you didn't listen to\nthe first or second episode in thisseries, today's episode will still\ncontain a lot of information andprotocols that you will find valuable\nfor improving your relationships.That said, if you have the opportunity to\nlisten to the first and second episodes inthis series, I think you'll find those to\nbe tremendously beneficial at any point.During today's episode, Dr.Conti discusses what makes for\na successful relationship ofany kind, as well as tools to\nimprove those relationships.He discusses various types of bonds,\nincluding healthy bonds and traumabonds, not just in the context of\nromantic relationship, but in thecontext of all types of relationships.We also discuss different challenges\nthat people face in relationships,including abusive relationships, and\nwe discuss the role of power dynamics,anxiety, and boundaries in relationships,\nboth from the perspective of unhealthyrelationships, but more importantly\nfrom the understanding and protocolsto cultivate healthy relationships.While there is an abundance of opinions\nand information out there on the Internetthese days about relationships both\nhealthy and unhealthy, today's discussionapproaches the topic of relationships\nthrough an entirely different lens, whichis the lens of the self in terms of one's\nconscious and subconscious mind, and howmultiple conscious and subconscious minds\nthrough different individuals, interactwith one another in ways that we can see\nand ways that we can't see, and all ofthat framed within the actionable steps\nthat any of us can take to improve ourrelationship to ourself and to others.Before we begin, I'd like to emphasize\nthat this podcast is separate from my"

            "text": "teaching and research roles at Stanford.It is, however, part of my desire and\neffort to bring zero cost to consumerinformation about science and science\nrelated tools to the general public.In keeping with that theme, I'd like to\nthank the sponsors of today's podcast.Our first sponsor is BetterHelp.BetterHelp offers professional\ntherapy with a licensedtherapist, carried out all online.I've been doing therapy\nfor more than 30 years.While I confess that initially I was\nforced to do that therapy as a conditionfor being let back into high school,\nover time I learned that therapy isa tremendously valuable practice.In fact, I consider doing regular\nweekly therapy just as importantas doing regular physical exercise\nin order to improve one's health.The beauty of BetterHelp is that it\nmakes it extremely easy to find atherapist that's excellent for you.And we can define an excellent\ntherapist as somebody who's going togive you a lot of support, but in an\nobjective way as well as somebody withwhom you can have excellent rapport,\na nd that can help you arrive atpositively transformative insights\nthat you wouldn't have otherwise had.And with BetterHelp, they make\nit convenient so that it'smatched to your schedule and\nthe other aspects of your life.If you'd like to try BetterHelp,\ngo to betterhelp.com/huberman,to get 10% off your first month.Again, that's betterhelp.com/huberman.Today's episode is also\nbrought to us by Waking Up.Waking Up is a meditation app that\noffers dozens of guided meditationsessions, mindfulness trainings,\nYoga Nidra sessions, and more.By now, there's an abundance of data\nshowing that even short daily meditationscan greatly improve our mood, reduce\nanxiety, improve our ability tofocus, and can improve our memory.And while there are many different\nforms of meditation, most peoplefind it difficult to find and stick\nto a meditation practice in a waythat is most beneficial for them.The Waking Up app makes it extremely\neasy to learn how to meditate andto carry out your daily meditation\npractice in a way that's going to bemost effective and efficient for you.It includes a variety of different types\nof meditations of different duration,as well as things like Yoga Nidra, which\nplace the brain and body into a sort ofpseudosleep that allows you to emerge\nfeeling incredibly mentally refreshed.In fact, the science around Yoga Nidra is\nreally impressive, showing that after aYoga Nidra session, levels of dopamine in\ncertain areas of the brain are enhancedby up to 60%, which places the brain and\nbody into a state of enhanced readinessfor mental work and for physical work.Another thing I really like about\nthe Waking Up app is that it providesa 30 day introduction course.So for those of you that have not\nmeditated before or getting back to ameditation practice, that's fantastic.Or, if you're somebody who's already a\nskilled and regular meditator, WakingUp has more advanced meditations and\nYoga Nidra sessions for you as well.If you'd like to try the Waking Up app,\nyou can go to wakingup.com/hubermanand access a free 30 day trial.Again, that's wakingup.com/huberman.And now for my discussion\nabout mental health with Dr.Paul Conti.Dr."

            "text": "Conti, welcome back.Paul Conti: Thank you.Happy to be here.Andrew Huberman: Today we're going to\ndiscuss relationships, and that willoften focus on romantic relationships,\nbut also relationships between friends,between family members, and inevitably,\nthe relationship to self, which is whatwe really focused on in episodes one\nand two of this series, episode onebeing all the things that go into a\nhealthy self and how to understand whatis unhealthy and healthy in all of us\nand make adjustments to the unhealthyaspects of our unconscious and conscious\nthrough really specific proactivebehaviors and patterns of thought.So really a roadmap to these\nideals that we call mental healthand understanding of the self.Today we want to talk about\nrelationships from the perspectiveof, of course, how people relate.But I have a feeling it's going to have\nsomething to do with, or perhaps almosteverything to do with our relationship,\nto understanding ourselves first.Paul Conti: Yes.Andrew Huberman: So, just to make\nsure that we're all on the same page,regardless of whether or not people\nhave seen episodes one and two, andcertainly people do not need to have\nseen or listened to episodes one and twoof this series in order to understand\ntoday's discussion, could you pleasetell us what is a healthy person?And how can we ask ourselves the sorts\nof questions that allow us to determinewhether or not we are healthy and where\nto look in terms of making adjustmentsif we want to be healthier than we\nalready are, which I have to believealmost everybody, if not everybody,\ncertainly wants to be the healthiestand best expression of themselves\nso that they can do the most forthemselves and for others in the world?Paul Conti: So, the linchpin of it all,\nis the agency and gratitude as verbs.That's the top of the mountain.There's a lot of climbing we do\nto get to the top of the mountain.Once we're over the top of the mountain,\nthen things are in a better place.And even though there are two words,\nagency is, of course, a word, gratitude is a word, b ut it doesn't\nmean that they're separate concepts.Approaching the world through the lens\nof agency and gratitude, thought of asone thing because they come together\nand they come together as verbs.That's what we're aiming for, because\nthat's the thing that we can work towards.If you think about what comes\nunderneath that, it takes us back tothe two pillars and the 10 cupboards.And if we're looking in there enough,\nwe're mInding, like what is in myunconscious mind I might not be aware of.Let me generate some curiosity\nabout my defense mechanisms andmy character structure and think\nabout what's salient inside of me.If we're doing all of that, then\nwhat we're doing, we're buildingempowerment, we're building humility.And then ultimately, the expression\nof all of that is the agency andgratitude, and it's something\nthat we can't have enough of.Like I say, what's the\nbest amount of that?The most that's possible, right?Because we're going to engage in\nthe world in the healthiest way.Because agency and gratitude doesn't mean\nlike, we're happy about everything, right?If there's something negative\nand we can change that, thenwe don't feel happy about that.The sense of gratitude in me\nmakes me more likely to feelthat I can change that, right?Or to take the chance of\ntrying to change that.And then the agency part of that\nconcept can come more to thefore and I can make the change.So it's not about bliss, it's not\nabout forgiving self and othersfor all sorts of things and not\nworking to make things better.It's about being in the world and\nbeing as aware as I can possiblybe, including being aware that\nthere are things I'm not aware of.So sort of having a healthy respect and an\norientation to the world that values truthand values understanding and exploration.If we do all of that, then we\nreach the top of the mountainthrough the agency and gratitude.And then what builds upon that or\nwhat comes from that is the peace,the contentment, the delight, the\ngenerative drive being strengthenedlike that all comes together.And then the aggressive, or we\nsay aggressive because that'sthe traditional term, b ut the\naggressive or the assertive.The assertiveness or assertion drive,\nhowever, whatever word we want to putto that, that drive exists in us in a\nway that subserves the generative drive.The same thing with the\npleasure drive in us.It exists in us, but it's\nsubserving the generative drive.And then all those good things come\ntogether and they come togetherto help us be as healthy as we can\nand to stay healthy, including whentribulation or difficulties come our\nway, so that we stay as best we canin the agency and gratitude as verbs.And again, there's nothing\ntheoretical about this.It's a way to live, and there are a lot\nof people who live some of their lives,or parts of their lives through that.And we can aspire to it and we can work\ntowards it, and if we're the best thatwe can be, then we're going to be in\nour relationships the best we can be.Think about it, like, you and I\nhave a relationship, we know eachother, w e're working together.If I can bring my best self to\nyou, to thinking about you, tounderstanding you, if I can bring\nthe agency and the gratitude,then I'm going to do right by you.I'm going to mentalize this\nidea of thinking about what'sgoing on inside of you.I'm going to bring the\nbest o f all of that.And then, because we have a\nrelationship, t here's also an \"us.\"There's a me, there's a you, there's\nsomething that happens between us.That's the relationship, that's the \"us.\"And I will also bring my best self\nto that thing that is no longer justme or just you, but that is an us.And that applies to all relationships.You can apply that to seeking health in\nevery single relationship in our lives.Andrew Huberman: What you're saying\nreally speaks to the importance of"

            "text": "it, and therefore anytime we're\ntalking about relationships, romanticrelationships or otherwise, we're\ntalking about the intersection oroverlap of those maps in some way,\nmaybe even the synergy and the outgrowthof those maps becomes its own map.I think we'll get to\nthis a little bit later.Paul Conti: Yes.Andrew Huberman: When I and most\npeople hear the word relationships, inparticular romantic relationships, I\nmake a couple of automatic assumptions.First of all, I have to assume\nthat people are either in arelationship or out of a relationship.There's probably a third category out\nthere of plurals and other things,but we'll keep it relatively simple.And most people, I assume, when they\nsearch for or enter, or entered arelationship, they thought about whether\nor not they had resonance with theperson, whether or not there was an\nintellectual or mutual interest resonanceor a physical resonance, maybe something\nabout family history, common goals, etc.That's typically what people think about.And then perhaps if people will have a bit\nmore of a psychological understanding, orthey're reading some pop psychology books\nthese days, some of which are pretty good,they might understand something about\nthemselves or the other person being abit more anxious or a bit more relaxed.So you'll hear things like\nanxious, attached, secure,attached, things of that sort.If we could just step back from all\nof that for a moment and examine itthrough the lens of the maps as you're\ndescribing them, which exist in all of us.And that really are the map to\nbeing the best version of ourselves.If we look at relationships in terms\nof lists of where people went toschool, if they went to school, are\ntheir parents married or divorced?Do they have trauma that they're aware of\nor not aware of these kinds of things, Iguess we could call those, and here I'm\nborrowing language that you used earlieroff-camera, so I want to acknowledge that.Points of compatibility,\nI think that seems like areasonable place to start, right?Do people want the same thing?So if you could, could you talk a\nlittle bit about points of compatibilityin a relationship and how those\nshow up, for better or for worse?When you encounter people in the clinical\nsetting, when you see somebody who's ina relationship that's really working for\nthem and is healthy versus if they're in arelationship where it's really unhealthy,\npresumably there's some knowledge aboutpoints of compatibility, but I'm guessing\nthat's not always intuitive, right?Paul Conti: I think the place we\nstart there is acknowledging whatwe can know and what we can't know.So this idea that there are levels o\nf emergence where things at a lowerlevel come together and create something\nthat's new, we see this throughoutscience, from subatomic particles\nall the way through to culture.So someone could know theoretically,\nlots and lots and lots about youand lots and lots and lots about me,\nbut they don't know about us, right?They don't know how we interact.They don't know if we have shared\ninterests, what we talk about.They don't know that.No one knows that.We don't know that about\nthe combination of people.We can't know it in advance, but\nwe often believe that we can, whichthen leads to a lot of false metrics\nof trying to figure things out.So when we're looking for compatibility,\nthe thought will be just very basic,tangible things, like in romance,\nfor example, if there's someone whoabsolutely wants to have a family\nand there's someone who absolutelydoes not want to have a family, okay,\nthat would be a reason for those twopeople to not choose one another.So there are these factors, but\nthe factors are all, in a sense,very evident and very concrete.If we go beyond that, we say,\nokay, we can see the obvious.Then what we're looking for is really\na compatibility of generative drives.And then that tells you, can\nthese people then get along?Maybe one of them is from one s ide of\nthe world and the other i s from theother side of the world, or one's an\naccountant and the other is a musician.And it doesn't mean that they're built not\nto get along or that if they're doing thesame thing they're built to get along, or\nif they went to college in the same place,or they went to college versus not going\nto college, there's so much there that wetry to build a story on, and then what we\ndo is we miss the forest for the trees.And the trees, I think, are\nthe factors that don't matter.So again, let's think about\nthe factors that do matter.Person wants to have a family,\nthe other person doesn't.That's relevant.But the trees that mislead us might be,\ndo they have the same level of education?Do they have the same\nfamily structure growing up?Are parents still together?What do they enjoy?Are they creative or\nscientific or whatever?Or creatively scientific.We could look at all of that,\nbut I think then we're making abunch of trees that mislead us.If you say, look, do these people come\nat the world through how much agencyand gratitude is there guiding them?How high is the top of that geyser?\nHow high is it uplifting that?How strong is the generative drive?If we match people upon that,\nthen we see, oh, those people gotalong and those people didn't.And then there are all the other factors,\nlike pheromones, a nd things that we can'tunderstand or reflexive first impressions.We could let things develop, honoring\nthe truth of what we can't know.That when you put two people\ntogether, you get something that'sdifferent from the sum of both people.It's not an overlap of maps, i t's a\nnew map, a nd the map is informed bythings that are on each individual's map.But what we're looking for are maps that\ndon't have very significant differencesaround just clear, concrete things.But once we get beyond that, the maps can\nsynergize in all sorts of beautiful andunpredictable ways, and if both are coming\nfrom the perspective of a generativedrive that is at the forefront, great.You put those maps together\nand see what happens.Maybe nothing happens.Okay.Those people don't go\nout on a second date.Maybe something happens, but it\ndoesn't develop in certain ways.Okay, those people dated\nand stopped dating.Like, this happens all the time, r ight?But we set the odds in our favor that\nthe generative drive in each that isat the forefront means that their maps\ncan synergize in ways that can then bebeautiful and ways that can maybe bring\nto both people that which they want.And I think there's a simplicity\nto that, that I think if we honorit can be very, very helpful.Whether it's romance, it's friendships,\nof looking at what the truth of itis instead of the factors that we try\nand gain a false sense of securityif we're using them to select upon.Andrew Huberman: You mentioned several\ntimes the generative drive, and I"

            "text": "definitely would like to learn more\nabout that and spend some time therein the context of relationships.But just to drill a little bit\nfurther into what we've all heardso often, and you touched upon a\nfew of these themes around points ofcompatibility, but also where sometimes\nwe can respond to the wrong thingswhen thinking about compatibility.Again, we're framing this mainly\nin the context of hypotheticalromantic relationships, but certainly\nit pertains to other sorts ofrelationships, things like, is one\nperson educated with an advanceddegree, and is the other person also?We tend to assume that people\nwho are, are somehow a bettermatch than people who aren't.That's sort of an implicit assumption\nthat's often made, not always.Or that if two people really love music,\nthat they will enjoy music together,and therefore the sum of the whole\nis greater than either of its parts.Paul Conti: And I think those\nthings are utterly irrelevant.Andrew Huberman: Interesting, and I want\nto hear more about this because I thinkthat if you think about, which I'm sure\nyou don't, but, like dating apps, forinstance, like what's listed out there\nor first or second dates, which consistsof learning a little bit about somebody\nand what they're doing and maybe even alittle bit about their history and maybe\nan activity and certainly an intentionalawareness to how the other person is\nbehaving in the context of differentthings, like a waiter or a waitress and\nhow they're treating people, and you.And then you hear about things like...this is not something I'm familiar with...oh, right, the love languages.People are like, oh,\nwhat's their love language?It's like gifts or, like acts of physical\ntouch or acts of service or something.I met someone recently, and she told me\nmy love language is all of them, which Ithink is the most honest answer, right?Because, sure, there's probably some\nweighting around what people valuemore or less, and in the absence\nof the things they value the most,it would probably feel a bit like\ndeprivation in any relationship.But as I'm describing all\nthis, I'm realizing more andmore, yes, all of that matters.Anxious, attached, secure,\nattached, love languages, etc.But it really doesn't get\nto the heart of the matter.It really doesn't get to this, as\nyou're describing it, this generativedrive in individuals, and whether\nor not those match up well alongthe points of compatibility with\nthe other person's generative drive.And I haven't run a controlled study\nfor this, but the best evidence I haveis that there, fortunately, are many\npeople out there who are in happy,healthy relationships, but there\nare many, many people who are not,either because they can't find them,\nor they're in them and they're nothealthy, or they're not happy, etc.So if you could elaborate a bit\nmore on the generative drive, againreminding us what the nature of that is.We covered this a bit in episodes\none and two, but what the natureof that is and some different ways\nthat that's expressed and how thatshows up in healthy relationship.Paul Conti: Yeah, I think we really\ndisprove the idea that some ofthese factors that I think are\nsuperficial in the context o f whetherpeople are going to be compatible.They're not superficial things,\nbut they're not germane.So let's say you think about music,\nand say two people are contemplatingromance, and they both really like music.W ell, that could go very, very well.Let's say they both have\na strong generative drive.Those pillars are pretty healthy,\nand the geyser of the agency andgratitude is riding upon it, and\nthey can find peace in themselves.They're strongly generative, then\nthey could become interested inthe music the other person likes.There's not going to\nbe a complete overlap.Even if people generally\nlike the same thing.But let's say they like different things,\nlike just liking music, or even likingthe same music, there's still difference.So the person has to go beyond themselves,\nand say, okay, I'm interested in what youthink, even about the music we both like.What factors do you like?There are places of learning\nand of growth for both.And you could see how both liking music,\nwhether it's the same or differentmusic, that sounds great, right?But you could also see how\nthat could not be great.If the generative drive is too low\nand the aggression drive is toohigh, then I'm going to think, I like\nmusic, my music is better than yours.People then start, they'll fragment,\neven though they have the same interest.Or if the pleasure drive is too high,\nthen they think, I want to listen tomy music, not yours, I'm familiar with\nit, instead of, hey, I'm interested inthat music because you're interested\nin it, and I'm interested in you.Which leads us to the second part.Let's say you have someone who really has\nno interest in music and someone who does.Well, there can be an openness of saying,\nif I'm interested in this person andthis person is really interested in\nmusic, I have some interest in it, right?I want to learn something about it.I want to experience some\nof it with the other person.And let's say that person then\nfinds, hey, that's not my thing.It's not the thing we connect\non, then, why would that bethe end o f the world, right?P lenty of people, one person goes\nto concerts, the other doesn't.So we try to find these points of\ncommonality, because I think weget over reductionist, and then\nwe think, oh, here's a bunch offactors that we will identify.And what they do is they obscure us\nfrom the primary factor, which is thegenerative drive, which, of course, will\nthen induce open mindedness mentalization.If I don't like music and you do, instead\nof saying, what do you like music for?I need a friendship with\nsomebody who likes music.You think, hey, that's interesting.If I'm interested in you as a friend\nand I have respect for you and what youthink, then why would I not have some\ninterest in what you're interested in?So this idea of compatibility revolves\naround the health in each person.It doesn't revolve around factors\nthat are anything but the concretelogistical factors that would\njust keep two people apart.Andrew Huberman: I love the idea that\nhealthy relationships center around thefactors that really matter within the\nself, in particular the generative drive.And I love the example of someone being\nable to be curious about somebody'sinterests, about their partner's\ninterests, even though they mightnot share those from the standpoint\nof agency and gratitude, because theagency component there is really key.I think that a lot of people feel\nas if they aren't really good atsomething or really knowledgeable about\nsomething, then it's not for them.Which is the opposite of\nhaving agency and gratitude.Because gratitude is\nclosely tied to humility.How could we know everything?It can be good, certain\nthings, and not others.So the way you describe it includes\naspects of openness, of humility, butalso the agency side, the empowerment.Like, if I'm going to learn\nmore, then perhaps we couldenjoy more of that together.Perhaps not, right?I think this is what I'm sensing, and I'm\nalso sensing that the words like-minded,like-minded people has so much more to do\nwith their generative drives and how thosematch up as opposed to the activities\nthat they prefer engaging in and the sortsof foods they like or the movies they\nlike, which makes sense at some level.But I think it is still counterintuitive\nfor a lot of us who just kind ofreflexively think, oh, they like the same\nthings, or maybe even they met at workbecause they like the same type of work.They like to live in a certain\narea of the country, andtherefore, by proximity, they met.And this raises all sorts of\ninteresting ideas, perhaps, aboutthe statistics of what we see.Like two musicians together, we\ntherefore assume that musicians belongtogether or two scientists together.I know loads of scientist-scientist\ncouples or scientist-physiciancouples, but of course, the numbers\nare skewed because they were workingin environments where it increased\nthe probability they would interact.So this is actually a vote for online\ndating in some sense, because it breaksthrough all those, sometimes even\ngeographical barriers, but certainlythe traditional barriers of culture.Paul Conti: Right.And if you think about it, we're\ntalking about relationships, soI would like my relationships to\nlast as long as possible, right?That means now we're talking about\nmy lifespan and my health span.That then becomes part of that discussion.And of course, we're very interested\nin lifespan and health span.And we see people do much, much\nbetter when they're interconnectedin the world around them, when\nthey're still learning new things.We know that's true, that people often\nwill tail, they sort of trail off of whatthey're learning, whether it's music,\nit's literature, it's the world aroundus relatively early in our lifespan.But the person who's interconnected\nlearning new things has a muchgreater probability of living\nlonger and living healthier.Right?So think, what's that about?It's about a generative drive.It's about, you know what, I've learned\na lot of things over the course of mylife, and I'm 80 years old now, and\ngreat, that there's more to learn, right?And that's what you see.It makes me think of a woman who's\naround 90 years old in my practice.She's always learning new things, she's\nsuper interested in things and I'm alwaysstruck by how she seems so much younger.And there, that's not just a selection\nbias, like, oh, I just happen tosee that in that person, she has the\nfactors that predispose to aging inthe way that's healthiest and happiest.So it really comes down to, the root\nof all of it, in ourselves, in ourrelationships, in the quality of them\nover time and how long we get to have themreally arises from a generative drive.And that's the thing that makes us\nthen undefended, and lets us findinterest in things about other people\nthat are different from the things inus, which also comes about naturally.I think it's interesting that we\nhave this sort of bias, like I said,that musicians belong together.Well, why?They're familiar with\nthe same things, right.I guess they have the same interest,\nsame thing with scientists.But then a lot of people\nlike different foods, right?I love different ethnic foods.Why?\nBecause it's different, right?It's an appreciation of difference.I don't want to eat just like I\ndid growing up and many, many,many people are like that.That's an appreciation of\ndifference, of diversity.So sometimes we'll kind of harness that\nand we'll look at it and we'll say, oh,that's present in us, but for whatever\nreason we become very reductionistabout relationships and now we're\ntrying to match based upon sameness,and sameness is not the point of it.I mean there are even thoughts\nabout people then in some wayseeking difference, and maybe\npheromones are telling us that.I actually know very little about\nthat, but I certainly know thatstriving for sameness doesn't make\ngood things happen in relationships.I've been doing this for over 20\nyears and I don't see that thealleged factors of sameness matter\nagain unless they're so concrete.Like if this person is absolutely going to\nlive in North America and that person isabsolutely going to live in South America,\nlet's not potentially put them together.But once we get away from almost that\nlevel of concreteness, let's lookfor something different, and then\nlike everything else, it simplifies.The higher we go up the ladder,\nthe more simple things get.If you're looking at the pillars,\nstructure of self, function ofself, you're creating the agency and\ngratitude, then what are you lookingfor when you're looking for a partner...a match in generative drive.I want mine to be strong and I see\nthat it's strong in this person.They create in a way, you know what,\nI do science, they grow a garden.We're generative together.Like that could be super compatible\nbecause we're looking at theone factor that really matters.Andrew Huberman: I'd like to take\na brief break and acknowledge"

and 'out ofsight, out of mind,' are in direct\ncontradiction with one another.So they're both true, it depends\non the circumstances and whothe hell knows why, right?You also hear opposites attract,\nbut they don't stay together.The important thing is to find\nsomeone similar to you or thatthere's like one person that's right?I mean, these are, if we really\nthink about it, crazy notions--Paul Conti: Yes.Andrew Huberman: --but they\ndrive a lot of what people thinkabout relationships, right?Paul Conti: They drive angst.Andrew Huberman: Right.Paul Conti: They drive bad choices.They drive situations that then create a\nsense of guilt and shame and inadequacy.We mislead ourselves by not going to\nthe basics of what is actually true.Let me look at myself, make myself\nas healthy as I can be, right?Because if I'm healthy, I'll recognize a\nlack of health in the other, s o it alsoprotects us against bad relationships.And then if I'm going to make myself\nhealthy, which we're describing, howthat looks, wouldn't I want someone who\nalso wants to make themselves healthier?At least if we're going to\nally, let's ally around makingboth of ourselves healthier.Andrew Huberman: Absolutely.And we're going to go deeper into how\nto look into the map of self and howthat relates to relationship, certainly\nmore as we go along this discussion.You've mentioned several times,\nhowever, about generative drive andthat it really is the definition\nof like-minded in some sense.And you also mentioned aggressive\ndrives and pleasure drives, themesthat we touched on again in episodes\none and two, but listening to thoseepisodes is certainly not necessary to\ndigest what we're talking about today.Could you go a little bit deeper\ninto the generative drive,flesh out for us what that is?I think generative, I think\ngenerator, I think energy.I hear aggression or aggressive drive.I think, as I think most people do,\nfriction, maybe even conflict, maybephysical conflict, maybe verbal conflict.But I know it's some of that\nperhaps, but a whole lot more.And then pleasure drive and pleasure.Some people think bliss,\nsome people think delight.Some people probably have all\nsorts of specific things theythink of with respect to pleasure.So if you could just flesh those out\nfor us a little bit more, becauseI think those are going to serve as\ncornerstones of today's discussion.Paul Conti: Sure.So drives, in this case the generative\ndrive, sort of exist within us.And what they do is\nthey're defining potential.So right now, one could argue, if\nw e just pause for a couple of seconds, we're not doing anything\ngenerative in those seconds.But then we resume doing something\nthat we believe is generative.So at the time we're pausing, that's\nwhen we can sort of look at that as adrive within us to make new learning, to\nunderstand things we didn't understandbefore, to spread a sense of goodness.So it resides in us in a way\nthat is determined by a wholebunch of different factors.Like everything else that's\ndetermined within us, there's anature and a nurture component.So some aspects of it are what are\nthe genetics that came down to us?What are formative experiences?But we can go in and alter that.So if we see the drive as a set of\npotentials, like in that moment, we pause.There's a set of potentials within us,\nlike potential of where we can take ourthoughts, our actions, our reflections,\nour decisions, that's the drive within us.And it exists within us in a\nway that we could localize now.Like, if we think enough about, okay,\nhow much of a generative drive is therein a person, how much is that person\nlooking to make a better life forthemselves or a better world around them?And how do they feel about themselves\nand their ability to do that?How generative are they?Or how shut down or\ndemoralized or envious?So we can, in a sense, localize that.And again, the localization has these\ngenetic and nurture components to it,but we can then go and influence that.And that's the importance.If the drive is a set of potentials,\na set of possibilities, then thatdrive is one and the same pervaded\nwith, however we want to describethat, with the agency and gratitude,\nbecause the agency and gratitude issort of the operative form of that.That's the verb.It's the drive, actually\ndriving something.So if you have a strong generative\ndrive, then agency and gratitudeare leading the decisions.The reflections are coming through\nthat, the aggression within us,or again, that's the historical\nword, but so we can say aggression,assertion, proactiveness, right?All of this inside of us and our\ndrive for pleasure, for gratification,that all is, then it's in us, but\nit's subserving the generative drive,meaning the generative drive, that\nset of potentials and possibilitiesis dominant, which of course makes\nsense with agency and gratitude, thoseactive verbs being what is most active.And then we're also going to feel at\ntimes, and hopefully at a lot of times,that set of peacefulness, that sense of\ncontentment, the sense of delight, whatyou're describing when you're doing the\npodcast and you're in it and all thesegood things are happening to you, right?There's a strong generative drive in you.That set of potentials are\nbeing actualized through theverbs of agency and gratitude.Like you're doing it all right then,\nand as you're doing it, you havea sense of peace and contentment\nas you're enacting all of it.And then that makes you healthier.It reinforces the generative drive.It protects you against the next\nsling or arrow of outrageousfortune that will come your way.You become more self knowledgeable,\nmore, you become stronger.And ultimately, that's\nwhat we're looking for.That's the state of goodness.And I believe that if you\nlook h istorically, whatis it that we're seeking?We can put so many words to it, and\nwe're choosing to put these words to it.I mean, I think that this is the\nstructure, because I think thescience, the history, the clinical\nexperience, the phenomenology,I think it all tells us this.We can put different words to it, but what\nwe're looking at when we're looking attruth and how to get to the \"happiness\"\nthat people have sought through theages, I think we know enough now.We've learned enough that we can say,\noh, this is what it looks like, andit fits the arbiter of all truth,\nwhich is, as you get further u pthe hierarchy, it gets simpler.That's true about humans.What's going on in my unconscious\nis very, very complicated.But if that's summing to, as we\nget higher up to, I'm approachingthe world with a lot of agency and\ngratitude, that's a lot simpler.And that's what can be common among\nus, which is why if my pillars are verydifferent from your pillars and what\nwe've struggled against, each is verydifferent, and what we may still have to\nwork against is very different, well, wecan be extremely compatible as friends,\nbecause are we working on ourselves?Are we fostering the generative drive so\nwe're coming at the world in that way?And agency and gratitude, that's the\nsimilarity between us that matters.And ultimately, we're looking at the\npotential that every moment we're buildingthe potential in us for what comes at the\nnext moment, which is why we're describingthe overlap, the point of commonality\nthat really matters, that matters.We're putting a label to it.We're saying it's the generative drive,\nbut i t is also that, okay, we both c omeat the world through agency and gratitude.If two people are assessing compatibility,\nbut if we're looking at something to nestthat under, and what seems most logical is\nthe set of potentials within us that we'rebuilding and altering each moment, and\nthen as I alter it in this moment, it'saltered and then affects my next moment.If I do something that's just kind of\nthoughtless to somebody because I'min a bad mood, then what am I doing?I'm projecting out my aggression.I'm doing something that\nbasically makes me less than.And then I'm going to feel\nless in the next moment.Whether that moment is about me or\nis about someone else, the drivesare the potentials in us, but we are\nactively working on them, determiningthem, changing them each moment.Andrew Huberman:

introvert all of that takes\nbackseat or perhaps even back backseat.Perhaps it even is out of the\nvehicle compared to the criticalimportance of generative drive.Paul Conti: Right.Andrew Huberman: When we think about\ngenerative drives in individuals, youbeautifully described what a generative\ndrive is and how it shows up inindividuals when thinking about generative\ndrives in romantic relationships, however,because generative drive can be expressed\nto varying degrees, does one often seethat, or do you think that, a matching\nof sort of levels of generative drivesis what fosters the best relationships?In other words, let's say somebody\nhas a pretty high pleasure drive,but not a very strong, aggressive,\nalso called, proactiveness drive.And so maybe they watch a lot of\nNetflix, like a lot of Netflix, butthey're not even the sort of person\nthat's really excited about the showsand telling you about them, because\nthere's a version of watching a lotof Netflix where the person is really\ninterested in learning and in knowing.Maybe even they're thinking about\nwriting something, you know,some poetry or book, or they're\nbringing some of that to their life.I mention it that way because\nwatching Netflix isn't bad, per se.It's not anti-generative.Paul Conti: Is it an\nescape, or is it generative?Is a person thinking about what they're\ngoing to do, they're going to writethat book, or are they just trying\nto numb out, and at the end of fivehours in front of the television, they\ndon't know what those five hours were?There's no intrinsic value judgment\nbased upon a lot of things thatwe make value judgments about.You have to look at, who is the person?What is the context?Are they being generative or not?Andrew Huberman: Yeah.Some of the movies and shows that\nI've watched in relationships becamethe points of connection around, at\nleast to me, tremendously interestingdiscussions on hikes that we took\nthe next day and reflections on ourown relationship and work and life.And so I'm so glad that you point out that\nthere's nothing intrinsically valuableor invaluable about something like\nNetflix, or even intrinsically passiveabout doing something like sitting around\nor even reading books, for that matter.There's a passive version of reading\ngreat books also, people forget that.It's hard to read a great\nbook and not learn something.I guess that's why they're\ncalled great books.But there is a version of\nthat, and I know many people.Paul Conti: People want\nto possess the book.I read the book and I'm going t o check\nit off and I don't know what was in it.Like people do that.That is not generative.Andrew Huberman: So should we consider\nmatching of level or expression ofgenerative drives as perhaps what we\nare all seeking in seeking relationship?And do you think that people tend to pair\nup naturally, pair up with people thathave a similar level of generative drive?Or if they don't, do you\nthink it leads to problems?Paul Conti: Yeah, I think that by and\nlarge people don't, that it's not thething that we're thinking about and\nlooking for in ourselves or others,and I absolutely believe that it\nmakes problems and let's take a look--Andrew Huberman: To not look.It makes problems to not look.Paul Conti: Right.It makes sense.The fact that we're not basing\nit upon generative drive doesindeed, I think, make many, many\nand in fact, countless problems.And I would take as an example, think\nabout the idea of a trauma bond, right.A trauma bond is not a bad thing.That sounds like a strong statement,\nbecause the way that I hear atrauma bond used is it's a bad\nthing, b ut it doesn't have to be.So let's take a look at it.Imagine that you have what\npeople call a trauma bond.You have two people who will\nmake up a situation, right.They're functioning in the world\naround them, b ut they each havehad some very s ignificant trauma\nthat is creating issues in them.So let's say they're avoidance issues.A person doesn't feel safe or\ncomfortable in the world around them.They get invited to places that\nthey'd like to go, but they don't go.They want to go to the museum and see\nsomething really new and cool there.But there might be a crowd.I mean, this happens.And let's say you have two people\nwho both have this in them.It could be because the trauma is similar.The trauma could be night and day.But they each have this in them.They could bond around that trauma\nin a way that worsens the trauma.That's why people think\nnegatively of a trauma bond.So if the case is that the trauma\nbond is not a good thing f or thesetwo people, you say, why is that?It's not because both of them have h\nad trauma and both of them are impactedby trauma, and both of them a re\nimpacted by trauma in similar ways.It's not that.It's that the drives are not in a\nhealthy place and the gratificationof the generative drive and the\npleasure drives are not high enough.So let's imagine the generative\ndrive could be relatively low ineach of these people in one or the\nother, or they could have a naturallyhigh drive that's being thwarted.So there's something that's out\nof balance where the drive is,the ability to express the drive.Is there enough agency?If there's not, like, let's say one\nperson is really, really shut down.That person can't stand their job, right?Okay.Something is shutting that person down.The generative drive wishes\nfor greater expression.They go back and look at themselves.You can bring that into line.But something is out\nof balance at the time.The pleasure drive may be low or it may\nbe high, but it may not be gratified.It may be that that person loves\nmuseums and wants to go to the museum,but can't find that gratification.That's a possibility.The aggression or assertion drive would\nbe on the low end, but it could be higher.Maybe if that person felt safer, that\ndrive within them has a lot of latitudein it, and maybe it could move higher.But something is out of balance in\nthe drives and in their expression.That's the problem.Because let's look at the\nother side, where a traumabond is a great thing, right?So each of the people in the example\nhas trauma, and they recognize it inthemselves, and they understand how\nit makes things harder for them, andthen they're communicating about how\nit makes it hard in the other, right?So maybe there's a lot of overlap\nin social avoidance and sense ofvulnerability, but maybe there\nare things that are differentin one person versus the other.So then they can come together and\nsay, look, what's the goal of life?I would like to be as\nhealthy a s I can be.I'm working on myself.You want to be as healthy as you can be?We want to be as healthy as we can be.And if we're healthy, we also\nhelp e ach of us be healthy.So maybe those two people, neither\nof w hich they would ever go to them useum on their own, because the\ntrauma inside of them is at a point it hasn't been worked through, or it's\na t a place where they just simply feeltoo vulnerable, but together they can\ngo to the museum, and then the bondaround trauma helps them be healthy.The drives are in a better place\nbecause they're able to recognize, hey,there are things going on in me that\nI'd like to be different and better,and you recognize that, too, and we\ncan talk about it with one another.Right?So they're in a healthier place,\nand then from that healthierplace, they build greater health.Andrew Huberman: So much of what we\nhear about in terms of friction points"

            "text": "in relationship centers around it seems\ncommunication or lack of communication.And as you're describing the role\nof the generative drive in healthyrelationship, it seems to me that\nit ties back in every way to agencyand gratitude and agency being such\na critical element of communication,because wherever you've identified that,\nokay, there's a potential problem here.People with high generative drive in these\nexamples seem to be capable of, like,self inquiry, asking the other person\nquestions that bring them closer togetherand to a deeper understanding of the self.I raise this because one thing that's\noften overheard, or that I've overheard,I of course have siblings and friends,\nand I'll place this in the way that I'vemost typically heard it, but I'm sure it\nexists in other ways too, which is theconversation in my head is one where a\nwoman is saying they're with somebody ordating somebody, and he's so clueless.I wish that he would just do this thing.Sometimes these are acts of chivalry,\nlike, maybe it's flowers or vacations, butmore often than not, it's a request or a\ncomplaint about a lack of proactiveness.This is also what ratchets up to\nthese very pan statements that youhear, like, oh, there's no real men\nthese days, or like, there are noreal men left, or this kind of thing.You also hear it in the reverse, right?You hear men making pan\nstatements about women.And here we're doing this in the\ncontext of heterosexual pairings.Paul Conti: But of course it\ncould all work just as well.Andrew Huberman: It could all work in\nthe context of homosexual pairings too.So you hear those sorts of things, and\nit sounds like a lack of communication.Okay, maybe one person needs to be better\nat asking for their needs to be met.Maybe the other person needs\nto develop more of an awarenessof what the other person needs.Of course, we all seem to kind of\nintrinsically wish that things wouldjust happen for us without the need\nto request them or ask for them.But I'm realizing again that all of\nthat is distracting commotion, becausethat's not really what's going on.What's really going on, it seems, is\nthat the engine behind communication, theengine behind curiosity, a desire to learn\nand know and create something from thatlearning and knowing in the relationship,\nthe generative drive, is really what'sthe issue, or the lack of generative\ndrive in any of those conversations.It seems one could circle back to that and\ngo, okay, well, someone's not asking theright questions and therefore not doing\nthe right things because they don't eitherhave a sense of agency, or they don't have\ngratitude for the situation they're in,including their own ability to do that.Right?So when you hear people aren't showing\nup for the relationship, they're notshowing up, or she's not showing up.Or again, let's make the pan statement\ngo in the other direction, thatsomebody just wants a lot of attention.They just need an excess amount\nof attention, won't let me domy own thing, but also want\nme to work and be successful.Again, these are stereotypes, but\nall of that seems very distracting.However, all of it seems far simpler\nif we push it through this filterof generative drives and whether\nor not it's being expressed.Paul Conti: Yes.I think maybe the best example of t\nhis, because it's so highly charged,is, i magine that the pleasure drive is\nthrough the lens of sex and sexuality.So imagine that people are in a pairing,\nthey're in a relationship, regardlessof h ow they got there, w e're taking...people are in a relationship.And one h as say, a sex drive, which means\na n interest in sex and maybe proclivitiesfor diversity of sexual experience.Let's say if we just for sake of\nthis example, we put on a one to10 scale, that person is a two.Okay, now let's say the other\nperson in the relationship--Andrew Huberman: 10 being the greatest?Paul Conti: Yeah, sorry.10 being the greatest.That person is a two.Now let's say the partner is an eight.Okay, so there's a big mismatch there,\nyou think, how does that normally go?The two stays a two, the eight stays\nan eight, and things don't go well.Andrew Huberman: Right.Paul Conti: It creates\nfriction in the relationship.At a minimum, it blows\nthe relationship apart.At a maximum, the person who's\na two feels inadequate often.I mean, it's not always right,\nbut this is how this often goes.Person who's a two feels inadequate\nbecause the person who's an eightwants either more or different and\nthe person who's a two doesn't.Now that person feels bad, and they may\nfeel bad about themselves or resentfulof the person with a higher sex drive.The person on the higher level\nfeels now resentful of theperson at the lower level.Or maybe they feel like there's something\nwrong with them because their sex drivei s too high, or they have an i nterest\nthat the other person doesn't have.And now they start labeling themselves.This happens all the time and it\ndoesn't change most of the time.And the problems are enormous.Okay, let's see.How would that look with really\nhigh generative drives andtherefore the ability to think\nabout self, to think about others,and to think about the \"us\" of the\nsituation, t he two people together.So they would be able to talk\nabout it in ways that wouldn't befaulting of the other and would\nacknowledge what's inside of them.Like, the person with the lower drive\ncould say things like, it doesn'tstrike me as more interesting.I don't think about it more.They could talk about all of that.The person who wishes more\nor wishes different couldtalk about that too, right.And could talk about what they feel\ninside, if there's a frustration of that.Just like the person with the lower\nsex drive could talk about howfrustrating i t feels to feel pressured.Right?So what are they developing?They're mentalizing.They're thinking about each other's\nemotional states, and they're coming ateach other through agency and gratitude.Like, I'm so grateful for you.Remember, see, the example is these\npeople are partners and they'rehappy with their partnership.Like, oh, my God, I'm\nso grateful I found you.They would each feel that way.I'm so grateful you're in my life.Like, this happens too, right?And then from that lens, the two\nisn't going to become an eight.The eight isn't going to become a two.But in general, in situations\nlike this, there can besomewhere in the middle, right?Let's say the two says,\nlike, okay, you know what?I can get out of my\ncomfort zone a little bit.Why don't most people try that?Because they feel embarrassed,\nthey feel self conscious.They don't want to try\nnew things or try more.People get closed down because\nthere's such shame around sexuality.You could take people on any spectrum\nof sexuality and you will find shamenot in every person, but across\nwhatever population we're looking at,because it's so emotionally charged.So let's say in a loving, caring\nrelationship, you're like, thatperson feels the freedom inside.Say, you know what?Maybe I could enjoy sex a\nlittle more, a little moreoften, a little more innovative.That person thinks about it like somebody\nwho's at a two can then move t hat toa different place a little b it more,\nor maybe even a lot more, depending.And then the person who's at the\nh igher level, the eight doesn'tneed another eight in order to stay\nin the relationship, but somethingmaybe more than a two, right?And then let's say they come into\nthe middle, and then the person who'san eight realizes like, look, I love\nyou and you love me and you're out ofyour comfort zone in order to do this.And wow, a nd it's like\nmore fun for both of us.So you know what?It's okay.My higher sex drive, I'll deal with that.That maybe just making it up, l ike, I\nwould like to do it t hree times a week.We're doing it, two.Okay, you know what?That's fine.Both sides can live with it.But it is not threadbear.It's not like, well,\nthey can live with it.It's like, no.Number one, they can live with it.Number two, it's better.It's better, right?The two at one point was\nthinking, hey, anything morethan a two is, I can't do that.They shut down.The eight doesn't want\nanything less than an eight.Now they're in the middle and\ntheir relationship is closer.That's real.That happens.What is it relying upon?It's relying upon the generative\ndrive to h ave the openness,the ability to communicate.Maybe the person who's an eight,\nsay, has a sexual proclivitythey're embarrassed about.That happens all the time, too.But in the sense of acceptance of self\nand the belief in the strength of therelationship and the acceptance of t\nhe other, people can broach things.Most people who feel like, oh,\nI c ould never broach that.It's not something bizarre or dangerous.It's not something that in a relationship\nthat's defined by the generative drive,the o ther person is likely to reject.So let's define our relationships\nthrough the g enerative drive,and let's cultivate in self a nd\nothers the most generative drive.If somehow, let's say, person A and\np erson B here, because it doesn'tmatter who's the eight and who's\nthe two, h as cultivated more of agenerative drive, then maybe that person\ncould give more t o the other beforethat person can give back to them.We have these, I think, just completely\nnonsensical ideas about mutuality.The idea that even in a situation that's\nsupposed to be defined by love, a ndfriendship is a form of love, right?So friendship, a collaborative endeavor,\nthey have some affection in them, right?Friendship can have love and often does.And let's say the love of\nromance, that there's supposedto be some equality, right?The idea that, well, if I'm going t\no give something, I want you to givesomething, too, it is not good if one\nperson is always doing the giving.Things are out of balance, but it\nis very healthy to be able to s ay,if I can give something and y ou're\nnot in a place to give something.Let me just give something to you.People don't always, or maybe don't often\ndepend on how we want to look at it,give to others with a sense of freedom.And you don't owe me anything either.Why?Because it comes from love.It comes from the abundance, the excess of\ngoodness in me coming through the agencythat I feel, the gratitude that I feel.And then what's more likely, you're much\nmore likely the other person, to sort offeel like, hey, I can go a little more.You feel stronger, you feel empowered\nmaking someone feel worse or saying,you know what, I can give you something,\nbut you owe me something back.Even if that's tacit, I\ncan give you this now.But you kind of know that the other\nperson is going to end up doing thelaundry for two months or something\nlike that, this is not okay.Why don't I just give something?You're giving goodness, and then the\nother person actually gets the goodness,and they're more likely to find it within\nthemselves to then come a little out oftheir comfort zone, develop, move their\ngenerative drive a little bit forward.Gifts given to others with no expectation\nof return are gifts of abundance.They're gifts that arise from\nthe generative d rive, andthey make us more generative.Think about the opposite.W hat often happens, each person\nmakes the other feel guilty, right?Oh, this person wants you, wants so much.And look, there you are again.Like, people feel terrible\nabout that, or t he're you don'twant any sex, or this or that.The other person feels terrible.That's why the two stays the two\nand the eight stays the eight.But it doesn't have to be that way, a\nnd it's also not that if both end upin the middle, say both a re a five,\nthat that's some compromised position.That implies less.No, that's the compromised\nposition that makes more.Andrew Huberman: I'd like to take\na brief break and acknowledge"

            "text": "we're calling it proactiveness drive, and\nthe pleasure drive, and the importanceof the generative drive being greater\nthan the aggressive or pleasure drives,I can also see the potential problem of\nhaving, like, two eights along the sexualdesire scale, or two nines, or two tens.And actually, I've observed\na lot of examples of this.For instance, if there are, let's say,\ntwo nines, put both people nine out of10 on the joy and sort of proclivity\nfor sex, adventurous sex, etc., they'revery high on the pleasure scale, perhaps\neven so much so that they don't payattention to, or one person doesn't\npay attention to the critical need forpoints of compatibility to be met, like\nthe desire to someday have a family.I've known couples like this.They're together for a long time.They seem to really enjoy one another.I know nothing of their sex lives, but\nthere just seems to be a very strongattachment around certain forms of\npleasure that they both enjoy engaging in.So this could be activities or travel.I mean, here we're saying nine\nout of 10 on the sex scale.But in many of those cases, there's one\nperson saying, but I want to have a familysomeday, and they're just not into that.Or perhaps even like, but\nhe won't leave his wife.They're involved in something\nthat feels really good.They're matching along some pleasure\ndrive, but completely overlooking thelarger goals of one or both people.Right here I pointed to an instance of\ninfidelity that's its own issues withmorals, etc., but you see this a lot.People really orienting towards what\nfeels good and who feels good to be with.And that, of course, is healthy,\nbut that's not the entire picture.So would you say that what I'm describing\nis an example of where the pleasuredrive has overcome the generative drive?Because in the case of somebody wanting\na family and the other person alreadyhaving one and being unwilling to leave\nthat one or the other person not wantinga family, that the generative drive of\nthe person who wants a family is notbeing respected or it's being undermined\nby this excess desire for pleasure.Like they're just drawn into the\nmoment and the amazing weekends,but this person's incredible\nand they're charismatic.And I can't tell you how many times\nI've had friends say that they admirethe person they're with, but they know\nthe relationship can't work becauseof all these other underlying issues.Paul Conti: Right.It's interesting.We both overestimate and\nunderestimate what, say, love can do.Right?\nPeople say, oh, love can do anything.No, if I spill that glass, love's not\ngoing to put the water back in it.If I must live in North America a nd\nmy partner must live in South America,we're not going to be okay, r ight?So we say these things\nin a very wishful way.Love will overcome everything.It doesn't overcome that, o r maybe\nit does in the right circumstances.So think about if the generative\ndrive i s very high in both people,s o both people have, say, a strong\nn eed to live in a certain place, they can find a compromise position.Maybe they live half the year in North\nAmerica and half in South America.But why?Because in that situation, the\nlove between them, which is thegenerative drive in the relationship.So what does that mean?The first person has to have a strong\ngenerative drive, be healthy, understandthat even though I n eed to live in North\nAmerica, does it actually mean that?That I really need to\nlive in North America?I have to be able to see beyond\nmyself, a nd what does that mean tothe p erson I love who needs to live\no n the other side of the world?If the other person can do that\nt oo, then in the relationship,which is a new entity, i t emerges\nfrom one person and the other.You can know everything about one\nperson, everything about the other.You don't know about the\ntwo of them together.So the two of them together are an \"us\".And if that us has a strong generative\ndrive, which it can If each personhas a strong generative drive, they\ncan bring to the state of emergenceof the us the generative drive.And we're talking about a relationship,\nso say the love between themand they can find a way through.So the idea that love cures\nall things, we have to define,what does that actually mean?It doesn't mean we have a lot\nof pleasure together, right?Or we like a lot of the same things.That's not what that means, a nd people\ncan very much love one another but not beaware of the limitations inside of them.Because maybe there are other things going\non in them, like, say, childhood trauma.They love one another, but they can't\ng et out of their comfort zone enough.So the point is, if we make ourselves\nas healthy as we can be a nd then twoselves come together that a re making\nthemselves as healthy as they c an be,then the us between them really can fit\nthat definition of love and do anything.But we have to define that in the\nright way, in a way that honorsthe truth, which, again, is not\na higher degree of complexity.It's actually more simple.Andrew Huberman: So you gave an\nexample of a romantic relationshipwhere one person has a strong sex\ndrive and the other a weaker drive."

            "text": "And then we talked about an example where\nboth people have an essentially high sexdrive and where that could potentially be\nbeneficial, assuming that the generativedrive is also high in both of them.And we also explored a little bit of\nhow it can be bad for relationshipif it exceeds the generative drive.What about the aggressive\nproactiveness drive?How does that show up\nin romantic pairings?If one person has a high proactiveness,\naka aggressive drive, and the otherperson does not, what does that look like?Do you see that often in\nyour clinical practice?Paul Conti: Sure.If this makes sense, maybe we look\na t that example of the personwho's a two and the person who's an\neight on the sex drive scale, right?You'd say, okay, the person who's\na t wo, who's trying to raise thatright, has a strong generative drive.What does that mean?The person thinks, you know what?I think I can do this.I can set myself about this.I see it will make my relationship\nbetter, I'm going to give it a try.That's a generative drive in\naction, the pleasure drive.The person may look at that and say, look,\nmaybe this can be more fun for me, right?It hasn't been that fun for me.If I have a low pleasure drive,\ncould I start enjoying this more?And then maybe that moves up, right?Or maybe I have a higher pleasure drive,\nbut it's not been gratified because Ihaven't been able to be open and honest.Let me see if I can make that better.Then what's active, what the person is d\noing, is then going to be the aggressiveor assertive, proactive to that drive\nand going to the potential in thatdrive and mining some of what's in it.Like, yeah, how am I going to do that?I'm going to bring myself to bear,\na nd that's not an easy thing.It's not like that person then all of\na sudden decides to be more sexual.There has to be a lot of communication\nbetween the two people, a lot ofdiscussion of what setting might be best\nfor that, what helps the person feelunderstood or feel more comfortable.There's a lot then, to do there.And the person may even need to\ng o back to the pillars becausethe p erson may feel like, whoa,\nI don't think I can do that.And then it is...that's not good.I want to do that.What is it that I can't do?There's a realization there.And then maybe the person who's an eight\nbecause they're so well connected gets it.Okay.You can't do that.Let me support you in whatever way\nwhile you're figuring that out.Because they're both generative,\nthey want to figure that out.Andrew Huberman: Sorry to interrupt.When you say, go back to the pillars,\nyou mean go back to exploringthe structure of themselves and\ntheir function of themselves--Paul Conti: Yes.Andrew Huberman: --so that they can, for\ninstance, get some insight into what sortsof defense mechanisms might be in place--Paul Conti: Right.Andrew Huberman: --what they're paying\nattention to or their behaviors,like maybe even health related\nbehaviors that could be impactingtheir sex drive, but maybe even\nthings that reside at a deeper level.The unconscious mind, talking to somebody\ntill they make a connection around shameor some story that they've integrated into\ntheir thinking at a subconscious level.Paul Conti: Right.Just an example that I see a l ot is\navoidance, where, again, not always,but let's say the person who's the\ntwo on the sex drive scale who f indslike, I can't do it, r ight, wow,\nI just can't bring myself to do it.And then they go back and they explore.This happens a lot\nwhere there's avoidance.And then we get curious about the\navoidance because the person'slike, there's something that\njust, I don't want to do that.So there's avoidance.We identify avoidance.We also identify that it's not healthy,\nb ecause the person does actuallywant to do that because it's good\nfor the relationship and it could begood for them, too, a nd then maybe\nwe start looking at u nconsciousmind, right, or conscious mind.And maybe we don't find\nit, because it's easy.Now, if I said, oh, there was a major\ntrauma that the person hasn't processed.Sometimes it's that, but a\nlot of times it's not that.Maybe that person just never learned\nto feel comfortable with sexuality.Or maybe the way that they experience\no r are attracted to sexualitywas disparaged or denigrated.Or they had some bad feeling\nabout it because the societyand the culture told them that.Or maybe they had a couple\nof bad experiences where theywere treated in a certain way.And then it's like, okay, that\nperson comes by that honestly,there's not a major trauma there.In fact, unfortunately, there's a trauma\nthat's almost predictable from theway our society has been structured.So person can go, look at that.I'm like, right, I never\nlearned how t o do this or howto be comfortable with this.Or you know what I learned that\nI'm not good at it, or I learnedthat no one will enjoy it with me.But that's not true.These are situations not on the\nside o f a loving relationship.Now t hat person is able to bring that\nknowledge to bear, whether it came from the unconscious mind or the conscious mind.And then that's how you work\nto start shifting things.Like, that was then, this is now.It is not then.when, say, the person, say in\nhigh s chool, had a sexuality thatothers didn't a pprove of and made\nthem feel bad, well, guess what?It's not then.And that's unfortunate.It's wrong.It's unjust.We're going to honor and\nvalidate all that that is.But we're also going to look at that.That was then, this is now.And you get to behave differently now.You're an adult now, and adults\nget to choose their relationships,and you chose a good relationship.So this is the kind of thing that can\nget that person to the p oint wherethey can go back up through now.What happens at the end of it?The geyser is stronger.There's more agency, there's\nmore of a sense of gratitude.Why?Because the person can attach themselves\nmore to, I'm so lucky to have this person,as opposed to, damn it, I wish that person\ndidn't have a higher sex drive, right?And they feel better about themselves\ninstead o f, what's wrong with methat I d on't have a higher sex drive?Or I said they wish the other person\nhad a lower sex drive or wish they hada higher sex drive that's not grateful.Like I'm grateful I am who I a m and\nthat I have any sex drive at all.And I'm grateful for this other person.Now, through that, that change, they can\ngo back and better access the assertion,t he proactive drive, the aggressive\ndrive, whatever w e want to call it,because they've taken away, they've gone\nand worked through the barrier to it.Then they're able to be a little m\nore out of their comfort zone, and theother person meets them there, right?And they start having this healthy thing\nb etween them where the us that is them,the love between them, gets better, right?And then where do they find themselves?That's how they get to the five,\nwhich is not a compromise betweeneight a nd two that satisfies neither.It is a compromise between eight\nand t wo that is way better forboth and for the relationship.Andrew Huberman: I'm curious about\ncommon pairings that you observe in"

            "text": "the clinical setting, and not to focus\non the bad, but if there are commonpairings that rarely lead to a good\noutcome, I think it's worth us learningabout those, simply because they're\ncommon and they lead to a bad outcome.And a discussion of this sort could\npotentially help people avoid suchpairings, or at least recognize\nthat they're in such pairings.And I realize, of course, because\nof the way that we're framing thingsduring this series, that anytime we\ntalk about a pairing, we're reallytalking about two maps coming together,\nforming a new and somewhat independentmap that represents the relationship.I have to assume that many people in\nthe world have maps that are very,very healthy, and they're probably\neven those rare individuals that don'tneed to go into those cupboards that\nreside within structure of self andfunction of self and do any work.But for those of you that are just\nlistening and not watching this,I'm sort of smiling as I'm saying\nthat, because I don't actuallybelieve any such person exists.I think all of us, even the healthiest\namong us, could be even healthierand express more generative drive and\nmore positivity for ourselves and forthe world were we to do that work.Paul Conti: Yes.\nAbsolutely.Andrew Huberman: So it's a lifelong--Paul Conti: There's no endpoint to that.That's beautiful.We can do that forever\nas long as we're here.Andrew Huberman: And you\nshould, I do believe.Which is one of the reasons\nfor having this discussion.Exactly.Nonetheless, I have to imagine that\nthere are also a lot of people outthere, perhaps most people, who\nstill have a lot of work to do.And those words, a lot, perhaps,\nare in bold faced capitalunderlined, highlighted letters.And as a consequence, we see relationships\nin the world that are not healthy.What are some of those\ncommon unhealthy pairings?I think it's worth spending at\nleast a little bit of time on this.Paul Conti: Yeah, sure.As we talk about this, I think that we\nshould make a sort of somewhat simplifiedbut hopefully helpful distinction.So there are people who are coming a t\ncoupling from primarily health, right?And again, this isn't to criticize\npeople who aren't coming atit from primarily health.We all want to get to where\nwe're coming at anything andeverything from primarily health.And there a lot of the problems are\nthose simple things like, wow, Ican't believe it didn't work out.I play the trumpet and\nhe plays the clarinet.It's like, no, that wasn't\na real set of factors.That's why it didn't work out.It's more in that realm.It's not always just that, but that\nk ind of stuff is a big factor.When we look in the other realm, where\nthere are significantly problematicmental health issues, which people\ncome by honestly but need to face iflife is going to get better, there\nare two common paradigms there.Now, again, there are way more than\nt wo ways this can happen, but I'mgoing to highlight two that we see\na lot and maybe more than anythingelse in the clinical setting.So the first gets called\nrepetition compulsion.But I want to be very clear, I do\nnot believe that there is any suchthing as a repetition compulsion.A compulsion is something\nthat one cannot control.What's going on inside the person is\nvery, very complicated when they're makingdecisions that lead to repeating a cycle.And those are things that can change\nand do not have to be compulsive.So people are often struck by why a person\nis in the same bad relationship, seeminglythat they have always been in, but with\na different name on the other person.I mean, people will say this like i t's\nthat person's fourth abusive relationshipin a row, and it seems to be, it's just\nthe same person with a different name.People say that a lot.They say that about themselves,\nthey say that about others,and it's very, very baffling.I mean, people have often been in my\noffice very upset about that, likerealizing they're repeating and they\ndon't know and it's frightening.And you can get a lot of fear\nand vulnerability from that.But there's a way of understanding it\nthat, because the limbic system, theemotional parts of our minds don't\ncare about the clock and the calendar.So trauma impacts, it impacts\nthe whole brain, but traumaimpacts the limbic system.It creates strong negative emotion that\nthen stays with us regardless of time.It doesn't care about time.So imagine now a person gets in a\nrelationship and the relationshipstarts to become abusive.I mean, it's easy to say that and\nthen move on to something else.What's that like for that person?What does that feel like when\nthat person, who they may haveseen as a protector, a friend, is\nnow cursing at them, denigratingthem, pushing them, hitting them?I mean, it's terrifying.It's horrible, right?So it is a deep impact, a t\nraumatic impact on the person.And a lot of the time, most of the time,\nlike all trauma, it triggers shame.So trauma triggers shame in us.If the trauma is strong enough, it changes\nus as we move forward in the world.And then we are different\nin a way that makes the pastvery immediate in the present.So what the person then is trying to\ndo, and there's been a lot of thoughtabout this over the years in the\nfields, trying to understand this,and I think in many ways doing a good\njob of understanding this, that the\"repetition compulsion\" is the drive,\nand I don't mean drive like we're saying.There's a push inside the person to\nt ry and make that right with the idea that if that person can be in that\nsituation again, and I don't mean inthe exact situation when someone raises\na hand to them, but they can navigatea relationship because they thought\nit was a good idea the first time.So they don't want to feel\nlike that was a very bad idea.So I'm going to make it right, a nd\nthen I'm going to be okay and I'mgoing to be whole because the person\nis driven by fear and v ulnerabilityand the shame of the trauma.So then they're trying to make it\nright because the limbic system doesn'tcare about the clock or the calendar.If you can make it right now.You make it right in the past, b ecause\nthat system doesn't care about the past.It's driven by trauma, s o then\nthe person's trying to figureout something that is different.They're trying to choose that person,\nbehave in the relationship, they're tryingto make t hings different, but they've\nselected for a d ramatically high pretestprobability of the same t hing happening\nagain, which is why if I could count thenumber of times t hat someone has said\nto me, oh, you're not going to help me,especially a t the beginning of therapy.There's no way you can help me.Five relationships were totally terrible.There's no way.There's no hope, right?People have said that to me so many times.The last three, the last\nfive, the last nine.And I will say back, if you t ell me\nseven different stories of relationshipswith seven pretty different people,\nseveral different relationships asthey evolved, and the same really\nbad outcome, I'll agree with you,but you're not going to tell me that.And that's why there's hope.And no one has ever told me s even\ndifferent stories where I feel like,wow, you just can't do it, right?No.And again, even if there were seven,\nI'm saying things for exaggeration.But there aren't.What is it?It's the same thing seven times.That's what it is.Because the person is repeating.And if they can understand the what\nand the why, why are they selecting?How are they selecting someone?What's going on inside of them?We go back to the structure\nof self, the function of self.We address what is there then\nthat absolutely can change.And then what we will talk about\nis that person then goes outto find another relationship.Even if they said they\nnever, never would again.Like now they're making the\ndecision to go out, as to say, whatrelationship a re you looking for?Your second.You're the first one seven times.No harm, no foul.But you can navigate the second\nbecause they're in a different place.They're coming through\nagency and gratitude insteadof denigrating themselves.If you're what's wrong with me, what's\nwrong with everybody else, I'm here.Even though some bad things\nhave happened to me, look atwhat I can bring myself to bear.I can go out there and try and find\nsomeone I can see with clear vision now.There's agency, there's gratitude,\nand then that p erson can goout and find relationship number\ntwo that's a really good one.Andrew Huberman: In the example you gave,\nit's very powerful and also very extreme.An abusive relationship where someone\nis sadly getting hit or screamed at.Oftentimes, it seems people end up in\nrepeated unsuccessful pairings, meaningunhappy pairings of maybe someone who's\nvery strongly assertive, maybe we wouldsay has a strong aggressive drive.Some people might even\ncall them a narcissist.That phrase is thrown\naround a lot these days.I mean, narcissists,\ngaslighting, like projection.These phrases are thrown around all\nthe time, I think, with frankly,very little understanding of what\nthey actually mean, unless they'recoming from a qualified clinician.Is it the case that somewhat\npassive or submissive peopleare drawn to narcissists?Are narcissists drawn\nto submissive people?I think these questions ring\nin a lot of people's minds.Paul Conti: If I could clarify\nsomething that I think I maybecould have said in a clearer way.You pointed out that the example\nI gave was a very strong oneor an extreme one, right?So as a physician, I think I\nnaturally gravitate to the extremecircumstances because they're the\nones that bring the greatest risk.But we are talking to people in those\nsettings, but most people are notin those extreme settings, but that\nextreme serves as a model for howthings that are less extreme can happen.So when I think, we're sitting here\ntalking to everyone across the spectrum,and most relationships that are not\ngoing well, thank goodness, are notgoing to be that extreme, or the repeated\npatterns aren't going to be that extreme.But it's just as important to pay\nattention to a pattern where one personreally is sort of more deferential than\nthey would like to be to the other,than is comfortable to them, and they're\nseeking someone, ultimately, who's justa little bit more assertive, and that's\nnot s ome disaster, but it cannot go wellover time, where that person slowly gives\nup, say, more and more of themselves.And there can be that repeated pattern.You hear people say, yeah, it was\npretty good or pretty equal at thebeginning, but then I just had l ess and\nless of a say, or t hen more and more.I just became the whole relationship.So it's no less important\nwhen it's less dramatic.Because the relationship still goes in\na wrong way when it's more dramatic.There's more risk, of course, but most\np eople are going to be in the lessdramatic but super important category.And I think it's important\nto point that out, too.Andrew Huberman: How much of what we're\ntalking about is nested on people's deep,"

            "text": "perhaps understandable desire to just make\nsure that the other person doesn't leave?I can't tell you how many times I've heard\nabout or observed relationships that fromthe outside that seemed really unhealthy.But it also occurred to me that people\nare doing things on both sides ofthe relationship that ensure that\nthe other person doesn't leave.So I'm not talking about a physical\ntrapping of someone in the environment.I'm actually talking about the opposite.I'm talking about somebody going against\ntheir better judgment and doing thingsfor the other person or against themselves\nor both, perhaps even in the contextof what looks like healthy family, like\ndoing an excessive amount of raisingof children or excessive amount of work\nto support the family, simply to ensurethat the other person doesn't leave.Paul Conti: Right.Here, again, we can look\nacross the spectrum.So before this, you had talked\nabout relationships that can be veryunhealthy, like a narcissistic person.And how can those relationships develop?It's important that we touch on\nthat in the context of this becausethat's sort of the extreme example.So people who are narcissistic, meaning\na narcissistic character structure.Now we're getting into the realm of\nsignificant psychiatric problems.And people who are\nnarcissistic are exploitative.They're a bottomless pit of\nneed arising from vulnerability,and yes, they can be helped.And if someone out there thinks I'm\nnarcissistic, then not trying tobe negative or mean like you can\nget help and you can be better.That's the whole point of what\nyou and I are talking about here.So people can change, but someone\nwho's coming at the world through anarcissistic character structure is\nexploitive of the other and then cansay, survey a room and find that person\nwho's had trauma such that that personis going to be desperate not to leave a\nrelationship, and then they can exploitthat person and often behave in awful\nways and the other person won't leave.Now I'm giving an example.It's not the case that\nway every single time.But that's the dominant picture.If you have a narcissistic person and who\nis that person more likely to pair with,and then you sense the vulnerability, the\ndesire for the other person not to leave,and that person would have to have then\nsignificant problems in themselves, likepotentially, instead of a pathological\nlevel of narcissism, a pathologicallevel of dependence, for example.So we're in the realm\nthen, of real problems.And again, real problems can be treated\nand real problems can be improved,and that's why we have clinical care,\nbut it can also serve as a model forseeing the ways that are less dramatic.So there are many people who,\nthrough the desire for the otherperson not to leave, and we could\ncall that attachment insecurity.And maybe if we leave away the stereotype\nversion of it, the person doesn't feelsecurely attached to the other person.And somewhere inside of them, they've\nlearned that if they're more pleasing, ifthey give up little parts of themselves,\nthat person won't leave, right?It might be because that's why their\nm other didn't leave their father,when they think about it, it might\nbe that's why their father lefttheir mother, because their mother\nwouldn't do that, whatever it may be.Or it may be their own prior\nlife experience or who knows,something they read but forgot?I mean, usually it's something\nmore salient, not always, butthey've internalized something that\nleads to a compromise of the self.Now, again, that's not what\nattachment insecurity is.Attachment insecurity is just feeling\nsome insecurity about the attachment.So, for example, I feel attachment\ninsecurity about just about everything.I've had the experience of sudden,\nvery painful losses happening,so I have attachment insecurity\nin the sense that I'm worried.I get anxious about people going\naway, and I can want to over control,but I recognize this inside myself.I try and do my best to say, look, I\ndon't want that to make me unhealthy.I want to recognize it.I want to find some happy medium\nwhere I honor that in me, but don'tget carried away with it to the point\nwhere I try and over control and thenI push my relationships away, right?So I say that because there's such\na contrast between that kind ofattachment insecurity, which can\ninvolve over control, and the kindof attachment insecurity that can\ninvolve compromise of the self.And we want to be very, very careful.We want to be careful.What is a trauma bond\nand what does it mean?We want to be careful.What is attachment insecurity\nand what does it mean?A certain kind of attachment\ninsecurity can lead a person to makeprogressive compromises of self that\nare not good and healthy for them.Andrew Huberman: I'm curious about some\nof these unhealthy relationships from"

            "text": "isolation, not complete isolation.And here again, I'm referring to or\nthinking about a romantic relationship.I can see how a healthy romantic\nrelationship could exist in relativeisolation, a few friends, some contact\nwith family members, or in greatconnectivity with friends and family\nand neighbors, etc., and still be areally great romantic relationship.Paul Conti: Sure.Andrew Huberman: I can also see how\nthe sorts of relationships that wehappen to be focusing on at this\nmoment, which are these unhealthydynamics, are made far worse by\nlack of connectivity to outsiders.In fact, a previous guest on this\npodcast was David Buss, who's aprofessor of evolutionary psychology\ndown at the University of Texas,Austin, and he talked about some of\nhis research into the dark triad.These are narcissistic, machiavellian,\nsometimes also sociopathicindividuals, and how that plays\nout in romantic relationships.And it's a terrible thing, but an\nimportant thing to understand given theunfortunate frequency that that occurs.But one of the things that I remember\nso clearly from that discussion withDavid Buss was that even when there\nisn't sociopathy or a strong desire todestroy the other, that in these sorts\nof relationships, there's often anattempt to isolate the person, first by\nisolating them from their family, alsofrom friends and coworkers, but all\nwith the goal of convincing that personthat no one else would want them as a\nway to make them \"voluntarily\" stay.In other words, to undermine\ntheir sense of safety, to ramp uptheir sense of anxiety, except in\nthe presence of that individual.And I'm remembering that now\nbecause as we're talking about,why wouldn't somebody just leave?Why wouldn't they just tap\ninto that agency and gratitude?It's clear that the oppressor in this kind\nof relationship has a real incentive totry and undermine agency and gratitude,\nbecause, of course, with those, theywould be revealed for what they are and\nthe person would feel unable to leave.Taking us back once again to the\ncritical need to cultivate agency andgratitude, not just in unhealthy, but\ncertainly in healthy relationships.Paul Conti: Right, and I think the\nprinciple here is that darknessalways favors the oppressor.So the oppressor wishes for darkness.So you want to isolate that person\nbecause when people see that thingsare better for someone else, they\nrealize things can be better.When people are told by someone\nthat they're worthwhile or they'refunny or they're pretty or they're\nsmart, or whatever the case maybe, they may take that inside.They may take inside, oh, maybe I\nam, I'm handsome and smart, maybe.Or they start thinking about that.They're very basic concepts that\nallow a person to entertain newways to look at themselves, right?So the person who's oppressing wants\nthat person to live in darkness.They don't want them to see\nthat there can be better.They don't want them to be directly told\nthat they're better than how things are.And that same darkness on the\noutside, say the lights are outaround the relationship is the goal\nof the oppressor on the inside.Now, again, the oppressor may know this\nand be doing it consciously, but oftenthis gets played out in unconscious ways,\nlike the constant denigration of someone.A person isn't saying inside, gosh, I'm\ntrying to reduce their agency, theiraggressive drive, really down to zero.But that's what they're doing.Somewhere inside, there's a knowing of\nthat, even if it's an unconscious knowing.And then the impact of that kind of\nabuse over time is a lower and lower andlower ability to bring oneself to bear,\nless proactive, aggressive, assertive,lower sense of agency and gratitude.That's really the definition\nof being demoralized.And that kind of abuse is always promoting\ndemoralization, because demoralizationis the darkness on the inside.Just as envy is too, demoralization\nis a form of darkness on the inside.Envy is no less dark.Envy may be a lot more active,\nbut in both cases, there's noknowledge, there's no growth, there's\nno wisdom, there's no learning.So they're the states of darkness.And what can happen in a way that's\nreally so tragic to think about is youoften can have an abuser, an oppressor,\nwho is living in total darkness inside,living through the lens of envy.And then you can have a person who is\nbeing oppressed, who is being exploited,who is living in darkness, but they're\nliving in the darkness of demoralization.And that's a very sad thing to\nsay, to imagine, and it's been avery, very sad thing to see, right?If you do clinical psychiatry for\nlong enough, you see a lot of this,and it doesn't have to be this way.Even the people who are oppressing\nhave it within them the majorityof time to make things better.And we do see that.I took care of a man a long time ago\nwho had been terribly abusive to hisfamily and it was always unclear to\nme, it had happened years before thathe just understood, and again, I never\nunderstood what happened, that he gotit and the man really made change again.I don't know what the circumstance was\nthat made that motivation to him, but hewent back and looked at himself, and he\nwent back and looked at how his fatheroppressed and terrorized the family\nand how he just did it automatically.Because what was rooted in his own\nfear of vulnerability, and he's goingto lose his family and not be a man\nanymore unless he oppresses them.He recognized all of it in him, and\nhe had changed it so dramatically.He had removed himself\nfrom the family system.And when I got to know him, it was\nyears later and he was reintegratingback into the system because there\nhad been such prolonged change.And he had communicated to the\nfamily his understanding of self.So, it's not impossible.Even someone who is abusing,\noppressing, coming through anarcissistic character structure.There's no therapeutic nihilism here.Things can change and things can\nchange in the oppressor, whichisn't excusing that, right?I mean, a person who's doing\nthings is morally culpable.They often are criminally,\nlegally culpable.So that is all true, just as t\nhe ability to change is true.And then the person we think about more\ncommonly in this situation, of course,is the person who's being oppressed.And there can be change there, too.But a problem is how hard it can be.The impact of the isolation, and also the\ndearth of resources to really help people.It's an actual true story of a woman\nwho I believed with all my heart couldget out of the cyclic abusive situation\nshe was in if she had a carburetor.A carburetor, right.She had a car.The car didn't function.She had a place to go where others\nwouldn't know that she was there.And the problem was just a few hundred\ndollars to change the carburetor.But it's like there's no place to go.There's no resources.We as a society don't help people.Now, it may be that someone helped\nthat woman and got her a carburetorand she drove away, right?But it shows how we can bring\nourselves to bear as a society tooffer people help, which sometimes is\nlike the lifeline the person needs.And maybe that person really needs\na safe house or something verydramatic, or they need a carburetor\nto get away from being terrorized.But a lot of times it's just community\nsupport structures, good structuresaround people in communities that can\noffer them support in situations thatmay be less dramatic, opportunities\nfor interconnection, which sometimespeople can find through social venues or\nthrough religiously affiliated venues.But the idea that community\nsupport systems on all levelsmake a huge difference.There's another level, right,\nbeyond the relationship, right?It's the society, it's the culture.And that's how we, on that next level\nof emergence, beyond the individualrelationships, can foster goodness, can\nfoster health in each and every one of us.Andrew Huberman: How do some\nof these same dynamics play out"

wherepeople working in laboratories, not the\nsame as mine, because I've been veryfortunate to have amazing benevolent\nmentors, quirky and outrageous attimes, but benevolent nonetheless.But others around me have been in\nlaboratories where, for instance, theworkload was just ridiculously high.Like the demand far exceeded\nwhat any person could do.And if somebody had, God forbid,\na cold or children, it was nearimpossible to impossible that they\ncould meet the standard there.Or stress dynamics, so pressure\ncooker dynamics, that made it whatanyone would call a toxic environment.You see this also in law firms.You see it in companies.You see it in families.You see it in friendship circles, right?I mean, how many movies are about\nteens oppressing one another throughbullying and ridicule and practical\njokes that are anything but funny, right,that are downright destructive, okay?And on and on.And so often the victims in these\ncases, if it's not a Hollywood movie,feel as if that's their only choice.Because to leave is to essentially\nhave no other options, right?It's not that the only option is to stay.It's that to leave is\nessentially to leave science.Because these people in positions\nof power have the loudervoice, they have the megaphone.They write the letters of\nrecommendation, the law firms.People talk.As I kind of spool this out in a\nlong form question, I'm realizing Ican't think of a single exception.Like, as long as there are going to be\npeople interacting and people talkingabout their interactions and people\nin positions of power, this sort ofdynamic is going to take place, right?Paul Conti: Absolutely.Anytime you have a closed system without\naccountability, you're just rollingthe dice for that kind of oppression.We need accountability.Think about theoretically what\nshould have happened there.There should be higher order\naccountability, whether it's in a companyor a university or wherever it may be.There should be higher\norder accountability thatis reasonable and rational.So it's not then acting in a top down\nway that would be over controlling,telling exactly what you can and can't\nsay or what you can and can't do.And sometimes there's too much\nrigidity that c an be enacted top down.But the problem runs both ways.If there's no accountability from\nthe bottom up, then that personis just simply stuck, right?Why?Because the system we've\nput into place has failed.And this is where we're talking\nnow about not just individualrelationships, two people relationships.But now we start talking\nabout systems of people.And systems of people are another level\nof emergence with a personality, so tospeak, an environment all their own.You can know everything there is to\nknow about each person in the system.You don't know about the system,\nbut what you do know is thataccountability is necessary.I mean, probably if we added up all\nthe examples in history, we'd haveto talk about them over 1000 years.How many examples do we have that\nclosed systems without accountabilityare just rolling the dice?They breed oppression.This is true.And I've been at several different places.So I'm not trying to implicate this\nany one place versus another, but Iwas part of a medical treatment team.So this is a hierarchical medical\ntreatment team of maybe seven people,give or take one, depending upon the\ncircumstances, where there was physicalabuse going on in the treatment team.It's true, and I'm not saying this in some\nexaggerated manner where somebody brushedup too close to someone and they slipped.No, hurting someone on the treatment team.Two different people who are being\nhurt by someone, seniors at a majoruniversity in a clinical setting.Again, it's not like that's the be all and\nend all, but you think about the alleged.The sophistication of the people in\nthe system, the alleged empowermentof the people in the situation,\nwhich did not put a stop to that.So we need to have accountability.The accountability has to be reasonable.It doesn't mean over control, but it\ndoesn't mean under control either.And if that person is being overworked,\nas you described, with no way ofwinning, or harmed on a medical team,\nand there's no way that that person canchange that, the system has failed that\nperson and failed them dramatically.And guess who suffers?Everyone does, right?That person suffers.And the science that's being done\nor the medical care that's beingprovided is important to all of us.Anyone could be the patient who is being\ntaken care of by the team, where oneperson is hurting a couple of the others.You think that medical care is\ngoing to be optimized, right?Is the science going to be optimized, that\nwe're utilizing to try and make our livesbetter, live longer, be in less pain?What's happening there is envy.That person who's oppressing other\npeople is driven by envy, whetherit's a narcissistic character\nstructure that acts almost exclusivelythrough envy, or it's envy that is\nin this person's life, in this wayor not another way, does it matter?What's going on there is envy.And envy is nothing but destructive.The generative drive is\nnothing but productive.Envy is nothing but destructive.Andrew Huberman: Could you remind,\nfor people that perhaps may not"

possibly different?Paul Conti: Right, and there's a\nvarying lexicon, which is why it isimportant to define it, because I think\npeople learn it in different ways.I've heard it talked\nabout in different ways.So, to define that, there's a\ndifference between jealousy and envy.And again, we could choose\ndifferent words, but this is theway I learned it that's been most\nimpactful, where jealousy is benign.It's the idea that if I see t hat\nyou have something that I don't,then I think, oh, well, maybe I\ncould work harder and get that thing.Or if I can't have that thing,\nlike maybe a person is younger.Okay, I can't make myself\nyounger, then I can think.Okay, through a lens of gratitude.Is that the only thing about me?I can't think of anything\ngood about myself, right?Other than maybe I could be younger.I mean, if you come at that through the\nlens of health, it's like, it's okay.It can serve to motivate people to try\nharder, work harder, take a look atthemselves and be more accepting of who\nthey are and what their circumstancesin life are, and what kind of control\nthey can enact and what kind they can't.It's okay.Envy is different.Envy comes at that problem from\nthe perspective that bringingdown the other person is just as\neffective as bringing up the self.That's why envy is destructive.So someone who might see another person\nand they envy them their youth, right?They envy.They want that, and they want to\nbring that person down becauseI can't make myself younger.But then they realize I can't\nmake that person older either.But they can do other\nthings to them, right?They can sexually harass them.Maybe they can make terrible\njokes that are really insultingand humiliating, maybe.There are all sorts of things a person\ncan do to bring down someone else.The inaction of envy is destructive.And I truly believe this, that\npeople who come at the world verystrongly through envy, by and large,\na narcissistic character structure.This is a small percentage of the\npopulation, but that small percentagedoes most of the damage on Earth.It's a strong thing to say, but when I\nthink about studying political scienceand thinking about history and learning\nmedicine and learning about psychiatryand sociology and really trying to look\nat the world and thinking, what drivesa person on a medical team who's gotten\nto be a senior physician to physicallyhurt doctors lower on the hierarchy?Envy.That person feels terrible about\nthemselves and then is beingdestructive to those people.Same thing.That same thing is at work in the lab.The same thing is at work when\npeople start wars of destructionthat just simply harm other people.And we can see no other sense of it.That from the individual setting\nall the way up to the world setting,we see the destruction of envy.And we also see it inside of us,\nbecause a person who's enacting envy inthe world around them is never happy.There's no chance of happiness.Hence the idea of a bottomless pit.Whatever you get, let's say an\nenvious person who wants more money.I want to have more money than anybody.I want everyone to have less money\nthan me/ So then they come at theworld t hrough the lens of greed.When they get more money, how\nlong does that make them happy?Right?This doesn't mean money is\nbad or having money is bad.It just means if you're coming at\nthe world through the lens of envy,and that lens is specifically focused\non money, then you will be a greedyperson who is never satisfied, even\nif you have 10 trillion dollars.So it's never good.It takes away from that person\nany possibility of happiness.And if you see people work with\npeople with a narcissistic characterstructure, there can be a sense of a\nvery brief happiness in the moment.Like, I'm happy because I realize I\nhave something someone else doesn't.I'm happy because I'm thinking of myself.And even though I feel very insecure\nand vulnerable inside, I have awhole set of defense mechanisms\nthat let me turn those tables aroundand then feel good about myself in\na way that places me above others.Whatever's going on in that person, it\nmay bring some very brief gratificationin the moment, but that's not happiness.Hence the need for the gratification\nover and over and over again.Narcissistic people are the least\nsecure, most definite people on Earth.They just have a phenomenally healthy\ndefensive structure that comes aboutin order to try and protect them.That leads them to go to the opposite,\nsome of what's called a reactionformation, going to the very opposite,\ndenial, avoidance, rationalization,projection, very unhealthy defenses\nthat then leads that person to protectthemselves from any help while they are\nfrantically trying to gain some goodnessthat makes them feel good for a split\nsecond and then disappears forever.Hence the tremendous\npredilection for destruction.Andrew Huberman: How do you,\nand how should we, think about"

            "text": "power dynamics in relationships?And perhaps starting with\nromantic relationships?I've heard it said before that\nthere's always power dynamicsin relationships of all kinds.I don't know if that's true or\nnot, but I've heard that, and I'vealso heard that that's particularly\nsalient in romantic relationships,independent of whether or not it's a\nhomosexual or heterosexual relationship.That there's always, to some extent or\nanother, one leader and one follower.This is an interesting, perhaps\na controversial idea, but I'veheard it enough times that I\nwant to know more about it.Paul Conti: Sure.Power dynamics, of course, are very\nimportant, but also something we tendto be so over reductionist about.I mean, this idea, think about\nthat, that there's always a leaderand there's always a follower.Every single relationship, right?That's true o n balance, we tend\nto be so reductionist, and thenwhat we do is we miss the real\npower dynamics that are going on.Just like I had said in a previous\nepisode, that I think my math minorhas helped me the most for all of life.I think a power dynamics course\nthat I took as an undergraduatein political science has helped\nme the most as a psychiatrist.Took it long before medical\nschool, because that class taughtme so much about power dynamics.I thought it was going to be about\novert power, who has power overwhom and tells whom to do what.Right?But what I learned is that so\nmuch of power dynamics are covert.They're under the surface, for example,\nthey're the things that are not said.Something that was called at the time,\nat least, the issue of the non issue,where there's an issue between two people.Like, this person never\ntakes out the garbage.That person always takes out the garbage.That person is resentful about it.Both of them know.But the person who always does it can't\nsay so, because if they say so, thefirst person will punish them in some\nother way by not taking out the garbage.Then the place smells, that person\ngoes to work, and the personwho's at home has to take it out.Right.That's one example of the\nissue of the non issue.Other examples are where someone is\nlooking and smiling and being reallynice to someone who they know is going\nto physically harm them if they bringto light that they're actually not happy\nand don't feel good about that person.So, from the dramatic to the\nnondramatic, unstated power dynamicsare going on all over the place.And they're in every single relationship.I mean, less a person is in a\nrelationship with someone elseand they're both comatose.I guess only one of\nthem has to be comatose.There are power dynamics going\non, but again, it doesn't meanthat they're unhealthy, because\nthere are always power dynamics.So then what are we looking for?And again, there are a lot of things\nwe could look for, but we could talkabout, really two primary things.One is, look for the nonobvious,\nand t wo is the give and take.So the first is even in\nour own relationships.Because it's interesting how many\npeople will, say, talk about thepower dynamics in their relationship.They're not always saying, here are\nthe power dynamics in my relationship,but they're telling me about them.And they're telling me about\nthe things that are overt.Right now, somewhere inside of them,\nthey know that they can't really raiseissue A, B, or C, or there'll be some\nretribution, whether it's small or large.Or they might even know everything's\nokay and that person is happy.But they know I'm not giving them\nroom to say that they're not happy.And that could just mean if they say\nthey're not happy, then I'll come homea couple of hours late the next day.And that person will feel some\nattachment insecurity because of that.And there are all sorts of\nways t his can play out.But since so much of power dynamics are\nunstated or covert, kind of like theiceberg of conscious and unconscious,\nthere's an iceberg of power dynamics.So, to think about including in one's own\nrelationships, whether it's a neighbor,it's a friend, it's a work relationship,\nor most charged, it's romance.What's really going on between us?What's really going on between us?I'm not looking to tell myself lies.I know that I may not be able\nto understand all of it, butlet me stop and think about it.And if you ask people to stop\nand do that, they can say,yeah, that's really not okay.Because sometimes they don't know\nthat it's there, or they don'twant to know that it's there.And the therapy work is\ntrying to guide them to.There's an immense power disparity,\nmaybe in the relationship when they'representing, no, everything is equal.It's a good, supportive relationship.Hear that a lot?And of course, it's not always that\nthere's something bad under thesurface, but a lot of times there is.And even something mildly bad is\nnot okay and can cause problems.And sometimes there's something very bad.So look for the nonobvious.And then the second is that give and\ntake is a very good sign of health.Is a very good sign of health.So if a person can kind of see that\nthere's give and take, and it mightbe about something as simple as.Like, who chooses where we go to dinner?Okay, sometimes one, sometimes the other.It depends who has a stronger feeling.Or it may be that person always\ndecides where we go to dinner.But the other person's okay with it,\nand that person always decides whatmovie they want, the other person.So the idea that there's give and\ntake, and then in periods of time whereone person may be in a more difficult\nplace, one person has a significantloss or an injury or an illness, then\nyou see that that shifts a little bit.One person is giving more, right?But then, ultimately the idea\nis that's from the outside.If one person is giving more to the\nother, there's a generosity of spirit inboth the giving and the accepting that\nleads them to then be stronger together.So even when people say, well,\nthey're imbalances in some way.If you just look at what's going on day\nto day, but in a healthy relationshipwith high generative drive, the periods\nof imbalance strengthen the relationship.You see this with friends, where\ntwo p eople have a pretty equalfriendship, and t hen one person\nhas something difficult happen andthe other person is there for them.What's true on the other side of that?They're better friends.And it's also why we often want to\nbe interconnected when we're healthy.What if something bad\nhappens to both of them?It's good to be interconnected,\nand friends a nd familycan be supportive to us.The idea that give and take is\nhealthy, I think, is very central.So just looking for evidence, it's often,\nif I don't understand what's going onin the relationship, maybe it's early\nin t he therapy or it's just been kindo f opaque, or I can't figure it out.I'm looking for, is there a give and take?Because then I'm going to think, okay,\nmore likely than not, things are healthy.If I see an imbalance, whether the\nperson knows it or not, I'm thinking,more likely than not, it's unhealthy.And then they're just clues along the\npathway of my efforts to understand.Andrew Huberman: The non-obvious\npiece is really intriguing,as is the give and take."

            "text": "And I really appreciate that you brought\nup the give and take, because that's avery concrete place that we can all look\nand ask ourselves, even if people aren'tin romantic relationships, like, what is\nthe give and take in a given friendship?And as you mentioned earlier,\nit doesn't have to be scripted.One for one.One for one.Maybe it balances out over\ntime, or maybe it doesn't.I mean, I've had friendships that have\nlasted many decades, even where I canhonestly say I'm always the person\nto reach out to the other person butwhen they connect, they connect with\nsuch a depth of attention that Idon't feel any deprivation whatsoever.In fact, I don't think\nI've ever considered that.I'm the person that always\nreaches out until today, and soit doesn't bother me whatsoever.I feel infinitely rewarded\nin the relationship.Like, it's generative, it\nfeels generative, right?Paul Conti: It doesn't have to be\nequal, however one wants to defineequal, but it has to be mutual.You're feeling goodness\nfrom the relationship.So is the other person.Okay.That's coming from that\nhigh generative place.And when we really, let's say\nwe push that concept forwardto where we want to be living.Not some pie in the sky, but\nagency and gratitude as verbs.The generative drive is very strongly\nexpressed, and the other drives aresubserving the generative drive.Then we get to the place where we\nreally see it is true that it isbetter to give than to receive.The happiest people I see are\nthe people who are giving.Now, of course, it feels great to\nreceive, but it feels better togive because there's a goodness\nin the self, in the giving.And I remember seeing this as a child and\nbeing too young to understand it, b ut Iwas a little kid, I liked getting things.And as a little kid, I liked getting\nthings more than I liked giving.Like, that's okay when\nyou're a little kid.But what I did observe is that my maternal\ngrandmother, who is very sweet and lovingand caring, she loved giving, right?You give her presents.And we did.And she really liked getting presents.She loved giving.There was an excess of goodness.And then as I got older and I learned\nmore, like who she had been in thecommunity and how she had been to people.And I could see, and now, through\nthe lens that there was such goodnessin her, I think she's, for me, she's\nthe shining model of goodness that Iinternalize as I aspire to be better.So then I think I want to be like that.I am more generative as I try and\nthink more about giving than receiving.I'm not trying to say I'm some\nnoble person or I'm being ascetic.I'm thinking that's a good\nway for u s all to feel right.Or someone, a very, very successful person\nthat I consult to that is in my life,who talked about how he always makes\ninside of himself the best understandingof what's going on between him and\nanother person, whether it's a very bigfinancial deal or it's about power or\nit's personal and then gives a little bit.Always, where have we ended up?Let me give a little bit, right.And there's a person who's very,\nvery s uccessful, very, very happy.But I would argue the goodness in\nhim is why he's successful and happy.It's not that he's successful\nand therefore he's happy.Right.It's what's inside of him that\nfosters both of those good things.And he could be just as happy\nwithout the big success.Maybe he wouldn't.Maybe he wasn't minded to do that.And he grows a nice garden.He could be equally happy.But the point is the goodness\nin self, to be able to do that,to feel good about doing that.I feel better about giving that\nthan I would have receiving that.That's pretty stark, right?It's something given to the other\nthat I would have gotten right now,and we're in maybe a negotiation to\ngive it feels better than to have it.Andrew Huberman: I'm sure there\nare many people thinking about"

within science\nand the other domains of life I'vebeen in, that there are far more\nsuccessful people who are alsogivers, even to a great extent.And of course, that doesn't mean\nthat they're giving to the pointof an inability to give further\nor to take care of themselves.The giving is part of taking\ncare of themselves, but it'spart of this generative cycle.It's not one thing.It's not a tit for tat.It's part of something that makes them\nfeel good, makes others feel good.It's sort of anti transactional.And as we're talking about the self\nand interrelations between selvesin these different relationship\ncontexts today, this wordtransactional keeps coming to mind.And what I'm so aware of as you're\ndescribing what healthy selves andhealthy relationships look like, is\nthat it runs counter to pretty mucheverything that I've heard and that we\nhear in the world about relationshipsand about the relationship to self,\nmeaning it's not transactional.It's really about a cycle.And we're using this word generative over\nand over in its specific context today.So I don't want to rob that word for\na different purpose, but I'm imagininga sort of upward spiral in my mind,\nor perhaps something that's reallylike a circle of life that just keeps\ngrowing bigger and bigger and bigger.Maybe we could talk a little\nbit about this notion ofrelationships being transactional.I mean, it's such a loaded word, but\nI have a close friend who's marriedwith more than a few children who\ntold me the other day, I realizedthat it's all kind of transactional.Like they're extracting from me and\nI'm extracting from them, and it'sbenevolent because it's all good.And I thought, wow,\nthis is really dreadful.No one wants to think that\nthe closest relationships intheir lives are transactional.And he was coming to that conclusion.I disagreed with him, and I don't know\nwhere that all sits for him right now.But maybe we could talk about the\ntransactional versus non-transactionalaspects of relationship,\nbecause we all want things.That's perfectly healthy.I believe we all experience\ndisappointment and pleasure and relief,and sometimes major disappointment,\npleasure, relief, et cetera.But what is the role of\ntransaction in relationships?And how does psychiatry, how do you,\nand how should we think about that?Paul Conti: Well, we often get confused\nbecause there are transactions in everyrelationship, but that does not mean\nthat every relationship is transactional.So if we think about what\ntransactions are, we can think ofin kind of the stereotypical way.So it can also be like,\nhere's the transaction.I'll do the dishes, and you\nwash the clothes, right?Andrew Huberman: Or, for instance,\nI'll make the money, and the otherperson will raise the children.Paul Conti: Right.So there are transactions.But that does not mean that the be\nall and end all of it are sort ofhard hearted, calculated transactions.And transactions also occur in less\nobvious but equally important ways.So another way that transactions occur is\nright now I'm putting something out there.Because I'm saying something, right?And then at a point, I stop\nand I'm waiting for you toput something out there.And then I take in what you said,\nand we're doing something thatin that sense is transactional.I'm waiting for you to give me something.I take it in, I process it, I\ngive something back out to you.But that's not the be\nall and end all of it.So there are transactions, whether it's\nwho's going to wash the dishes, who'sgoing to do the clothes, or it's what d\no I put out there that you take in, a ndwhat do you put out there that I take in?That there is something greater than\nsomething beyond the transactional.And there is some controversy to\nthis, a thought that there really isa historical thought in the field.That there are just aggressive\nand pleasure drives in us, andthat everything is transactional.Now, again, we don't really\nhave a way of disproving that.I mean, there's not going to be\nsome equation that disproves that.But I think it's entirely\ndisproven by human experience.And there's so many, we could talk\nabout an infinite number of resourcesto consider this, but just imagine\nthe writings of Viktor Frankl andthe writings and the theories around\nhuman interactions and psychologicaltheories that have come of it.To think that everything is just\ntransactional, it's a denial of thehumanness in all of us that I think he\njust brought to the fore so strongly.But again, there could be nearly\ninfinite resources throughouthuman history that say, hey,\nwe're not entirely transactional.It's not just aggression and pleasure,\nbut there's something more going on here.There's learning that feels\ngood for the sake of learning.There's kindness that feels\ngood for the sake of kindness.There's giving that feels good,\nbecause giving feels good.This is going on in us.It's going on when we're, like, loving\nchildren, for example, or loving animals.There's something inside of us\nthat's not just transactional.And that's why I think what we're\ntalking about is, if it's truth,it should all hang together, right?It must all hang together.And this is why there's an us over top of\neach individual that's in a relationship.This is why you can know\neverything about me.You can know everything about you, and\nyou can know nothing about our friendship.Absolutely nothing, right?Because it's something different.And if it were all just transactional,\nthere would be nothing different, right?And I think our experience as human\nbeings, I know that to be true,because I just know that I don't\nalways feel selfish about things.Like, maybe sometimes I do,\nand I do something nice becauseit'll make me look good.Like, okay, we're all human, right?But I know that there's good\nfeeling from others towards me.At times, that's just\nabout the good feeling.I know that there's that\nfrom me towards others.So that tells us, yes, there is\nsomething other than just the I.There is the we of dyads, right, of\nrelationships, no matter whether they'rework, family, friendship, relationship.And then there are the levels\nbeyond that that are larger \"we\"s.The we of groups.Andrew Huberman: So if I understand\ncorrectly, it can be the case thatone person makes the majority or all\nof the income for a family, the otherperson raises the children, takes\ncare of the majority of the home.And of course, there is a transaction\nthere, a set of transactions, but thatit's in service to something larger\nthat really isn't transactional.I'm just stealing your words here,\nbut if I were to expand on that,just to make sure I understand that\nthe non-transactional thing thatemerges from that is generative,\nbecause it's a family, right?It's a family that everyone can extract\ngrowth and pleasure and meaning from.And just because the roles are divided\nas such, it doesn't necessarily meanthat the relationship is defined\nas transactional in the sensethat it's less than it could be.Paul Conti: Right.If you think about what's\nreally being transacted.So, say one person is out in the\nworld and is making an income.The other person is, say, taking care of\nthe family and taking care of the home.What's being transacted?Well, the person who's making the\nmoney is sharing the money, right?In that sense, transacting some\nof the money to the other person.Like, you get to have some of it, too.You get to have some\nof the benefit from it.And the person who is at home,\nwho's taking care of the familyin the home, saying, you get to\nhave some of that too, right?You get to come home, the\nchildren are taken care of, right?The home is taken care of.So both are transacting\nsomething to the other.I mean, that's the truth of it.If you look at what's really going\non there, one person's getting thebenefit of money they didn't earn,\nthe other person's getting benefits.They have childcare they\ndidn't do or pay for.They're not paying for childcare,\nthey're sharing resources.So, yes, that's true.But is that it?Are these two robots?One is the money making robot, and\nthe other is the childcare robot.That's not what's going on.The way we want to envision that,\ni f we have two healthy people withg enerative drives is they love one\nanother, they're creating something betterthan they could create on their own.In fact, they've created children,\nthey've created a home together, andthey're nurturing that family together.That is generative.And because it's generative,\nit can also be flexible.So let's say the person who's\nat home says, I need to do somethings outside of the house, right?Or let's say the person who's out working\nthinks, oh, my God, I feel overwhelmed.And I like to switch to a better\njob, but that job's halftime.I could be half in the house, right?This is where people can come\ntogether in the same way.We talked about the two and an eight on\nthe sex drive or sexuality scale, wherepeople then can find compromises, right?And if one really wants to stay out of\nthe home all the time, but the person inthe home wants to leave the home, well,\nthey find a way that that works, right?Because their care for one another,\nthe generative spirit that isin them individually and as a\ncouple, lets them nurture that.And one isn't interested\nin oppressing the other.I'm not going to leave my job.You stay at home or I'm staying at home.You stay out there.It's like, okay, let's think about things.Let's communicate, right?That's how the generative drive not\nonly makes that awesome, like thefive isn't the compromised position\nbetween the eight and the two.The five is awesome right here.The transactional aspects are awesome\nbecause of the generative aspects ofwhat comes of it far more than either\nof those people could make on their own.I mean, one would say it's not so obvious.Maybe if one makes X amount of\ndollars, each could make half X.That's not what we're talking about.Neither of them can create\nthat family on their own.Andrew Huberman: It seems that so\nmuch of what we're talking about"

            "text": "way, and we should talk about that more.But it seems to me that one of the things\nthat gets in the way of asking for whatwe want, of hearing requests of us in\nthe way that is going to bring about themost generative goodness, is anxiety.It's like you're tired from a\nlong day and someone mentions,we have to take the trash out.I was at work all day.That kind of thing or earlier you\nwere talking about the issue of thenon issue in terms of power dynamics.Well, let's just say I've had the\nexperience before in relationship offeeling like if I make a request or I\nhave a quote unquote complaint aboutsomething, that the other person is\ngoing to be so upset about the factthat they didn't do something well,\nthat it's going to be three days ofjust diminished happiness for everybody.So I just assume, not deal with it, right?So when we hear the word anxiety, I\nthink we often think about the person,like quaking about public speaking\nor like getting the circuits intheir brain hijacked that were only\ndesigned for saber toothed tigers.But anxiety seems to serve both\na very important functional rolein modern life that has nothing\nto do with physical threat.But it also seems to be the feature\nthat if not kept in check, if we can'tregulate our own anxiety, I'm realizing\nthere's no way that we're going tobe in a position to ask for what we\nneed and what we want, to hear what'sneeded of us and what others want.In other words, anxiety seems like a\nmajor barrier to the generative drive.Paul Conti: I think the place to start\nis i f you show me a person who hasno anxiety, I'll show you a mannequin.We all have anxiety in us.Remember, it's just a word, right?What are we getting at?We're getting at a sense of tension\nor a sense of disquiet inside ofus that we would like to solve, we\nwould like to ease, if we could.It is not helpful or healthy if\nwe have very, very low levels ofthat, because then our strivings\nare certainly going to suffer.There's not a lot of motivation\nto go make change in theworld, a change in our lives.So if we have too little of that\ntension, that doesn't go well.And of course, that maps\nto a low assertiveness,aggression, proactive drive.There are other ways that could\nshow i tself, but it maps veryclearly, I think, to that.And that's not good for us on\nthe other end of the spectrum.We're much more concerned with the\nother end of the spectrum because alot of anxiety feels very, very bad\nand it feels very bad right now, right?So our high levels of anxiety,\nthey narrow our cognitive spectrum.They narrow our ability to think\nabout what's going on aroundus, to think about ourselves.So the idea with anxiety is\nto recognize, hey, we all haveit, and we can call it anxiety.We can call it tension.We can call it whatever we\nwant t o, but we want that tobe i n a healthy place, right?Which comes, of course, back to the self,\nthat if my levels of anxiety are veryhigh and therefore it's causing problems\nin my relationship, like maybe I'malways asking my partner if we're okay.That happens a lot.Like, are we okay?Are you happy?Because there's a lot of anxiety in me.The first place to go\nis to look at myself.So we could say, oh, I\nhave attachment insecurity.That's just stating the obvious, right?Andrew Huberman: Or, sorry to\ninterrupt, but a very common onenowadays that I think is new in\nthe course of human history isthe tugging the line phenomenon.You text somebody, you're thinking\nabout them, you don't hear back,and then tension starts to mount.And then depending on the context,\nyou may either be concerned aboutthe person or even suspicious\nabout what the person is up to.I mean, here it's very contextual, right?And it depends on the history of both\nindividuals and that relationship.But then the person will reach\nback eventually and it eitherwill bring relief or relief with\nsome resent, like, where were you?What happened?This is very, very common.So much so, in fact, that I've\ncome to learn in talking toothers, and this is the classic...I have a friend who, but really\nothers who are in the landscapeof looking for a relationship.And there are people I know well who\ngo through a lot of effort to set anintermittent schedule of response.Like to not give the other\nperson the sense that they alwaysrespond with short latency.Because, indeed, sometimes they will be\nable to do that and sometimes they won't.What they're basically trying to do is\nmake sure that the person doesn't, they'reactually trying to take care of the\nother person in addition to themselves.Because I think we come to expect\na certain latency of responsewith certain individuals.And if we don't hear back with that\nparticular latency of response,our own anxiety starts to pick up.And it can be quite damaging to a\nrelationship, in particular to thegenerative drives within us, because\nin that time that we're stressed,we're not tending to other things,\nincluding things that we could do for therelationship that we're so worried about.Paul Conti: The famous scene in Swingers,\nright, where t he person leaves a messageand then lives the whole relationship\nin his own m ind and breaks up with theperson and they never actually spoke.There's the anxiety run wild.And of course, I remember that\nwas very popular when it came out.Why?Because it resonated with the\ninsecurities we feel and now with theability to feel those insecurities\nin a much more immediate way.That person didn't text me back.There's a lot more of that inside o f\nus, which really points to if you're ableto identify that you're anxious, too.Anxious for comfort, which, again,\nif one looks inside or even listens,maybe to what others have said or\nreflected, like, there's a lot ofdata, especially introspection, t\no be able to identify that, right?The next question is always, why?Let's go look at that.Maybe that person has been\nanxious their whole life.Maybe they just have\nrun tense all the time.You know what?Sometimes a little bit of medicine\nthat kind of just pulls that down.P erson can take that for 50 years, life\nis better, t here's no side effects, s osometimes that might be the case, right?Sometimes the person's anxiety kind of\ngrew throughout childhood, and maybethat's because there were difficult\nthings or traumatic things that happened.Maybe there was nothing like that,\nbut maybe the person was very good atengaging in the world and then felt\nmore and more pressures upon themselves.And no one ever did anything wrong,\nand they've only been rewarded.But regardless, look at\nthe anxiety in yourself.Go back to those pillars, right?And one might discover, for example,\nmaybe the anxiety I'm feeling isattributable to the other person.Am I feeling anxious\nbecause I'm intimidated?Am I feeling anxious because I\nknow that if I don't behave in acertain way, the next time there's\na group meeting, there'll besome snarky joke made about me.So, anxiety, sometimes it's the self.Sometimes it's got a lot\nof biological components.Sometimes it's got a lot of\npsychological components.Sometimes both.Sometimes it's the environment.Sometimes it's the other.The other person.So look at why.Because that's how we learn.Like, what is going on inside of me?Where is that level of anxiety?How does it not feel comfortable?What actually is it?How is it changing, how I'm behaving?How might it be changing?How am I responding to it?So, what are we doing?We're going back to this, look in those\n10 cabinets and figure out why, which wecan do the vast majority of times between\nourselves and the use of others, eitherprofessionally or non professionally.We can go understand the\nanxiety or the lack of anxiety.Why am I not so motivated?Right?I mean, that's the case with a lot\nof people who feel demoralized.They don't feel they can\nget anywhere in the world.The world's a bad place, and how are\nyou going to make your way in the world?And they start feeling nihilistic, or\nthey feel like the eight ball is againstthem, even in a generational capacity.And now they feel demoralized, and the\ntension inside is soothed by things.So maybe that's the person who's\noverusing the thing that soothes, right.So they could go look at, hey, I\nwas kind of motivated and did wellin sports or did well in this, was\ninterested in that, what's going on?That's how a person could identify,\nfor example, being demoralized.So that process of inquiry gives\nus the information that we canuse in the service of change.And the change, while not achieved\n100% of the time, the change forthe better is predictable if it's\narising from a place of understanding.Andrew Huberman: I'm very curious\nabout frames of mind in relationship."

            "text": "In particular, how being in our own\nexperience, say, anxious because someonehasn't responded to us and really paying\nattention to the anxiety and drilling intoit and asking ourselves, why am I anxious?And do I deserve to be anxious?Is it about me or is it about them?Whether or not that's a valid pursuit,\nor whether or not focusing on theother person and trying to imagine\nwhat's going on in their head, thatthey might be doing this or that\nthey seem to do something repeatedly.This, of course, relates to much more\nthan just the scenario of waiting fora text message and feeling anxious.I think so much of how we come into\nrelationships of all kinds, romanticcertainly, but family relationships\nare in and around the tendency toswitch back and forth, sometimes\nseemingly at random, between our ownexperience and what am I feeling?What am I experiencing?And then thinking about the other.Like, what are they thinking?What are they experiencing?I mean, this has everything\nto do with human dynamics.I would think that it's near impossible\nfor the typical person to just livelife through their own frame and\nlens and never pay attention at allto what others might be thinking.Even, for instance, the most exploitive,\nextractive narcissist sociopath presumablyis thinking about who in the room\nis going to be their target becauseof how that person might be feeling.And of course, on the benevolent side,\npeople who want to do positive, generativethings in the world are probably thinking\nabout who to align with, who has commongoals that they might want to work with\nor be with romantically that could helpthem and the other person generate.So what is this thing that we do?What is it called, and how does it work\nto place ourselves in the mind of others?And what roles does it serve and what\ngoals does it undercut when we do this?Paul Conti: Well, I think the first\nthing to say is that everythingfollows the same simple pattern.So I start with thinking about me, right?If I'm anxious, why am I anxious?What's going on inside of me?Then I think about you.Are you anxious too?Or maybe I'm not anxious,\nbut I notice that you are.So there's the thought about the\nI, because I can't think in aclear headed way about you unless\nI've thought about me, right?Because if I'm really, really\nanxious, then how am I supposedto understand and try and get an\nidea of where you're at, right?So then where do we arrive?We arrive at the magic bridge of the us.That's what connects us.Whether the us is a friendship, it's a\nprofessional relationship, it's romance.There's the bridge of the us.Because it's not just\nhow or when am I anxious.How or when are you anxious?What are things like when we're together?Maybe that.Maybe I'm anxious when we're together.And what's that tension about?Or you're anxious when we're together.And maybe that's for reasons we\ncould talk about and make less.Maybe there's some insecurity in one\nof us, or maybe the other person isbehaving in a certain way that's not\nmaking the second person feel good.We can then come together and see\nhow does the us impact the levelof anxiety, and how do we then take\naway from the us being stronger?So think about, w e talked\nabout the trauma bond.Trauma bond can be\nenacted in a negative way.It can be enacted in a positive way.And those two people who can go to\nthe museum together, who can't goto the museum separately, they're\nliving in the magic bridge of the us.They're both at the museum, but\nneither can go to the museum.Neither can go to the museum,\nbut both can go to the museum.And then they take away\nstronger selves from that.That's a reinforcing experience.It's positive.It builds the generative drive.It builds confidence.The person went, they were assertive,\nand that was gratified in a goodway, and they felt pleasure.So when we look at the us, it is about\nthe us in the moment, but it is alsoabout how two people are impacting one\nanother in the rest of their lives.And of course, this is more important\nthe closer the relationship, like thisis very important, for example, in close\nfriendships or family relationships.And I think this is of extreme\nimportance in relationships.These are the two people who presumably\nare the closest to one another on Earth.So a shared us that promotes understanding\nand bolsters a sense of agency andgratitude and bolsters the generative\ndrive that's great for both peoplewhen they're not in the us, when\none goes one way and one goes theother, because that happens all the\ntime in relationships, too, right?Go to work at different places or\nwe bolster ourselves outside ofrelationships if we see what the magic\nbridge of the relationship can be.So, we can look there for\nproblems like, why am I anxious?Why are you anxious?Why are we anxious?Why are you only anxious\nwhen we're we and not...?We can look for all that,\nand we should, right?But we can also even more\npowerfully look for the good there.How can our shared bond, whatever\nit may be, be better for both of us?And what stronger incentive could there\nbe than to do that in relationships?Romantic relationships, the ones that\nare closest to us, if they're notromantic, they could be friendships.Whatever our closest relationships are,\nthey're the most important vehicles,so to speak, to better health and\nhappiness, to getting to that placeof peace and contentment and delight.The us is very, very powerful.In fact, even more powerful\nthan the I and the you.Andrew Huberman: When thinking about\nthe us and trying to understand why"

            "text": "somebody that we know and are in\nrelationship with is behaving the waythey are or might be feeling or claiming\nthey feel the way that they are.How useful do you think it is for\nus to put ourselves in their shoes?I can think of all sorts of ways\nin which this could be beneficial.I can also think of all sorts of ways\nin which it would be focusing off theself and our own experience in ways that\nmight be defensive avoidance or denial.Yeah, I'll come clean.I mean, there have been plenty of times\nin relationship where I get fixated onwhy someone is the way they are, behaved\nthe way they did, and more often than not,by taking a step back and thinking about\nwhy my reaction to that is the way it is.I don't solve the \"problem,\" but I get a\nlot further along in terms of quelling myown anxiety and finding a path forward.Paul Conti: Right.Well, mentalization, which is the\nability to discern feeling states,intention states in self and others.But now we're looking for others, right?So the ability to understand feeling\nstates, what's going on inside of you?Intention.What are your intentions?That should only be good, because if\nwe're seeing it through a clear lens,meaning a lens that's not biased by\nsome problem, like a defense mechanismof rationalization, for example, or of\nprojection, if we're seeing clearly,we're learning about the other.And the learning is never bad.Knowledge, truth is good.So if we learn about the other by,\nin that sense, putting ourselves intheir shoes, then we gain information.But it's the health in us that\nis so crucial to what we dowith that information, right?So one person could say, put themselves\nin the other person's shoes andthey can say, okay, that person, I\ncan see that person's responding.And they say, pretty calm,\npretty calm about something.And maybe that's just a good thing.Maybe there's some contention going\non and that person's maintainingtheir cool and that person is going\nto be really helpful in navigatingan argument or a disagreement to\nsome really positive endpoint.So, if a person sees clearly,\nokay, I can see that you're calm.And I also see that you're trying to\nfigure things out and the things thatyou're saying are sort of positive.You're disagreeing with me,\nbut you don't seem to mean ill.Then I can see, you know what?I think your calm is good, because I'm\ngetting a little bit upset and you're not.And I see that there's\na benevolence in you.So maybe you'll guide us to the\np lace that maybe I can't, right?But think about if there's\nnot a clear lens inside of me.If I have a defense system that leads\nme to externalize, responsibility thatleads me to project or leads me to do\nall sorts of things that are not healthy.Now I might think, well, you're calm\nbecause you just don't care about me.I mean, so think of the same exact thing.Now in the example we're giving the person\nin your position is like being reallybenign and benevolent, but it happens\nall the time where that is misconstrued.So it's not that the insight,\nthat person is calm, I see thatthey're calm, it's that there's\na deficit in the mentalization.The person is not fully\nunderstanding their intention.What's coming through then gets distorted.So, we think about defense mechanisms.They can be clear, they can let light\nthrough in this beautiful way that hasfidelity, or they can be very distorting.So the thought that, if I'm discerning\nthat you are benevolent and you seem to betrying to solve the problem for us, but I\ntake in and you just don't care about meand you're trying to put one over on me.If I've assessed it accurately,\nbut it comes on the otherend in a way that's changed.That's because there's a lack of\nclarity , there's distortion inside of me.Right?So then if I'm really working on\nmyself, I'm in the best place Ican be, I'm going to be better\nat mentalizing about you and me.Even if I say, well, we're having a\ndisagreement, I know I tend to geta little defensive, so I'm going t\no be a little biased to see w hat'sin you in a kind of negative way.So what am I seeing like, okay, you're\npretty calm, maybe you don't care.I know I can think that, right?But come on, you're trying.You want to solve our problem.Imagine when that goes on inside\nof a person, which sometimesgoes on consciously or goes on\nunconsciously or some mixture.It's so powerful.The person is aware of their own state,\nwhich helps them to be aware of thestate of the others, of the other.And then the information they're\ngetting comes through with fidelity.And now all of a sudden, instead of\nmaybe I'm going to blow things up nowI'm allying with you in solving our\nproblem because I see clearly about youand me and that's going on all the time.It might sound, well, it's complicated.There's a lot of back and forth, right?There are millions of things\ngoing on every split second in ourunconscious mind that is throwing\nall this up to the conscious mind.It's doing things rapidly that's\ngoing on all the time in us, whetherwe want to acknowledge it or not.And we choose not to acknowledge it at our\nown peril because then we're not going tothose two pillars and their 10 cupboards.We're not going to the structure of\nself, the function of self, and whatcomprises those two pillars to look for.Hey, what's going on?Right, let me understand better.And even if things are going well, we\ncan always, as you said not that longago, we can understand ourselves better.The stronger I am, the more generative\ndrive there is in me, the lessdefensiveness, the more the agency and\nthe gratitude, the more I'm armed forwhatever difficult thing comes my way.So if there's a conflict with\nsomeone, w hether there should be orthere shouldn't b e, maybe someone's\nbeing really aggressive and I'vegot to kind of say some things\nand try and counter that, right?I'm going to be able to\ndiscern one from another.I'm going to be more effective in both.I just set myself up for success,\nand if I'm setting me up for success,then I'm also setting you up for\nsuccess if you're someone I have arelationship with, no matter what it is.And then ultimately I'm setting the\nwe right, the magical bridge of us.I'm setting that up for success too.And that's how you see in these\nlevels of emergence, that if youunderstand everything about you and\nunderstand everything about me, andlet's say a person understands we\nhave a generative drive, you don'treally know what our relationship is\ngoing to be like, but you think, I betit's going to be a good one, right?And then what would we then\ncontribute, s ay, to a broader culture?So a group of people, maybe there's\n10 people, a bunch of friends gettingtogether, we would contribute goodness\nat that next level, which is thenthe culture o f the larger group.Andrew Huberman: In hearing your\ndescription of mentalization, thisability for all of us to get into\nthe mind of another and to tryand imagine motivations and states\nthat would explain their behavior--Paul Conti: And the self, right?\nThe mind of self and other.Andrew Huberman: Yeah, that seems\nlike a natural reflex that's healthy.And it seems to surface most\noften as the consequence ofnegative interactions, right?Something didn't go right.And so we kind of explore\nlike, was it them?Was it me?Was it something that happened before?What else is going on with this person\nas a way to try and arrive at some sortof hopefully generative understanding.But it seems to me that there's also\ngreat value in mentalizing about othersunder conditions in which things are\ngoing well, so that one can potentiallymake things or encourage things to go\neven better in future interactions.Paul Conti: Right.Well, the first thing I would\nsay i s, I think the reflexis most often not mentalizing.That the reflex is most often\nnot mentalizing, r ight?Because the reflexes often come\nfrom a position of not feeling safe.There's some conflict.I don't feel good.If there's some conflict, people, we\noften get very defensive very quickly,whether we show it on the outside\nor we start partitioning inside.And the problems come not from\nmentalizing, but they come fromnot mentalizing and not being\naware of the difference, becausethen I conclude, I know what's\ngoing on in you and I don't right.Because I don't know\nwhat's going on in me.Right.\nAnd I think you're being aggressive.Really.I'm feeling kind of defensive.I'm feeling vulnerable, and\nthen I'm getting aggressive.But I can't handle that because\nI don't want to be aggressive.So you're aggressive.So there's such a difference between, say,\ncoming at a self other conflict from theperspective of, say, not mentalizing, but\nthinking that you are versus mentalizing.There's a difference between, is it me?I know it can't be.Is it you?It must be.Right?And that's how a lot of that goes.And then, of course, what's the\ndata t hat's gathered, the datathat's gathered supports that.I mean, I think there's wars I\nthink have happened based uponthis, let alone conflicts in\nfriendships and in relationships.The key about mentalizing\nis that's not what it is.Mentalizing.It goes like this.Is it me?Is it you?Is it us?Let's figure that out.Let's figure it out together.It's not defensive, it's not aggressive.It's not projecting.It's really actually seeing.And look, if it's me, I want to be\naware of it and say, yeah, like, whoa,I got up on the wrong side of the bed.Let me just say I'm sorry, right?Or if I might say, look, I know\nthat you're being aggressive andyou normally wouldn't be, and say,\nlook, let me just get away from it?Let the person I care about\ncalm down, come back later.Or if it's us, is really something\nb etween us, then let's sort it out.The information that allows the healthy,\nthe agency and gratitude decisionsis always there through mentalizing.The danger is when we're not\nmentalizing, but we think we are.Andrew Huberman: Got it."

cupboards under\nthe pillars of structure of self, functionof self and our desire for all of that\nto geyser up into agency and gratitude.One thing that we hear about so\nmuch these days, and generally Ithink it's good that people are\ntalking about them, are boundaries.You've crossed my boundary,\nor I'm setting a boundary.And I've certainly embedded the\nmessage in my head that in orderfor certain relationships to be\nat their most loving in my life,sometimes the boundaries require very\nlittle frequency of communication.But that doesn't mean the\nrelationships aren't ongoing.So what are your thoughts on boundaries?And how should we think about boundaries\nfor the sake of healthy relationships?Paul Conti: Well, healthy\nboundaries always start inside.And then once we have them squared away\ninside, we can project them outward.The same as everything works, right?It starts with the self, and\nthen it includes the other.So let's say you took an\nexample of a friend who's justa little too presumptuous.Like the kind of person you'd rather k\nnock on your door, but who just opens thedoor and comes in, that kind of thing.And you like the person a lot, and\nthere's a lot of resonance, and youdon't want to lose the friendship.Let's imagine what could happen here.It's not the only thing that can\nhappen, but a thought experiment, right?So the person may then question\nthemselves, like, is theresomething wrong with me?Because I don't really like this\nperson coming in my front door.Is that just me?Am I being weird about that?Or the person can kind of stop\nand think about that, and they cantake stock of self, and they can\narrive at an answer for themselves.Like, look, that person may\nconclude that, you know what?People I'm as close to as this\nperson come in my front door.You know what?That's okay, right?You know what?I don't need to set a boundary there.That's possible, right?More often, what the person concludes\nis, no, I don't really want that.I do actually want this\nperson to knock on the door.And that's okay.There's not something wrong with me.It's not that I'm being a jerk.It's not that I'm being\na bad friend, right?Because what are they saying?You might say, oh, they're preparing\nfor what the other person couldsay, but no, they're countering what\nthey're testing out to themselves.Does that mean I'm a bad friend?No, right?That kind of thing.So they know, and then they\nunderstand, and they have theright to set the boundary, right?Like, okay, it's my house.I try to be generous, but I still\ndon't want people coming in the door.Like, you come to some conclusion\nthat setting the boundary is okay andyou're squared away with it inside.Then you communicate the boundary\noutward, and you decide, howdo I want to communicate that?Like saying, hey, man, don't\ncome in the front door anymore.That's not so good right now, the\nfriendship is really on the rocks, right?But to say to someone something like,\nyeah, look, I care about you, and I trustyou, and I know you feel the same way\nabout me, but it just makes me nervouswhen people just come in the door.Do you mind?Is it okay if you just\nplease knock on the door now?Think about how that's been done.It's so accurate to what's going on inside\nthe person, to how the person wants tocommunicate with the other, then you have\nthe highest likelihood of effectiveness.And the person also, in that sense, has\nsort of the clean conscience, so to speak,that lets them take in information back.So let's say the other person hopefully\nhas a high generative drive andall the good things we're talking\nabout could say, oh, I'm sorry.I didn't mean to make\nyou feel uncomfortable.I kind of just automatically do that,\nor I always do that at my brother'shouse when it's close by or whatever.The person is saying, no worries,\nokay, everything is fine.Right?But let's say that\nperson does get mad now.You know, like, whoa, what's\ngoing on in this person?Because what you're doing is you're seeing\nsigns of unhealth in the other person.And it may be that, whoa, that's\nnot so healthy with the person.But I like other aspects of the\nfriendship, and that seems likekind of a strange idiosyncrasy.Then you might decide, you know what?I want to keep this friendship.So I'll start locking the door, and the\nperson has to knock, or you might think,okay, am I seeing something here that's\nabout lack of consideration, right?That's about selfishness.That ultimately may be about envy.I'm going to walk into your\nhouse and ruin your privacy.I'm going to walk into your\nhouse and make you feel anxious.I feel entitled to do that.The kind of thing that's really\ncoming through the lens of envy.So then you start thinking about\nthat, and maybe not always.Of course, sometimes you find a\nfriend who can do the right thing.Sometimes you find a friend who can't, and\nyou can still make the friendship work.Sometimes you find a person who's not\na friend, and you see, like, oh, that'show e verything is with this person.You realize, like, there's no us.There's no us, right.And that's how people can leave\nrelationships that ultimately areexploitive in one way or another.Whether it's a friendship, it's a romance,\nif a person really understands, there'sthe me, the you, the magical bridge of us.And then, wait, there's\nno magical bridge of us.I feel that there's a magical bridge\nof us, but the other person doesn't.There's immense power of\nunderstanding and then of appropriateself care and self protection.Andrew Huberman: Over and over again."

self understanding, thoughtful,structured inquiry along the lines of\nthe map that was laid out in episodesone and two of this series and that we've\nbeen alluding to numerous times today.Paul Conti: Yes.Andrew Huberman: And then there's a\nsecond line or rule that I've got writtenon this imaginary piece of paper in my\nmind, where anytime I default to thinkingabout another without first going to\nmy own map and exploring what's goingon with me, that my own map starts to\nbecome blurry, like I'm losing access toit and it potentially could disappear.I'm just creating this in my own\nmind as a way to create a littlebit of, I think, healthy anxiety.Paul Conti: I like it.Andrew Huberman: To really go\nthere first, paints the picture.Paul Conti: Yes.Andrew Huberman: And the purpose in having\nsuch an image in my mind, that accessto the self and understanding of self is\npotentially drifting away, is because Ithink, for me, there's a third line in\nthis rule set that I'm imagining, whichis that the less understanding we have\nof our own map and internal process,the more likely I am, or we all are,\nto just latch on to an unhealthy map.Another unhealthy map.Paul Conti: Yes.I have to even follow the directions\no f our own unhealthy map.Which leads us to someone else's\nunhealthy map, and then welatch onto it, like you said.Yeah, absolutely.Yes.Andrew Huberman: Yeah, that's right.Because it's still active, even\nif it's blurry or if it's obscuredfrom my awareness and drifting away.Paul Conti: So if I'm trying to guide\nmyself with my broken compass, I runinto someone else with a broken compass.Now we're both wandering, so be aware.If the compass isn't working the way\nwe want it to, can we go look at that?Can we make the map healthy, make\nthe map accurate, make the mapguide us towards what we want?Because then we will find other people\nwho've worked on their own maps that way.Andrew Huberman: Absolutely.And so often I hear about, and\nfrankly, I've experienced thisfeeling like, oh, it's just a matter\nof finding somebody who is healthy.Right?And then things will be\nmuch easier and much better.And surely that has to be the case.And surely there have to be instances\nwhere people have an interactionwith somebody that leads to a\nrelationship with somebody and theother person is much healthier.And whatever trauma we come to the\nrelationship with is best supportedor better supported than it would be\nif we were with somebody exploitativeor who was truly damaged in some\nway, who basically had a map that wasreally, I don't want to say screwed\nup, but that they had not explored.Paul Conti: They need a lot of work.Andrew Huberman: They need a lot of\nwork, but I don't see that very often.I definitely see people who, at least\nfrom my outside read, seem to have healthymaps or are doing regular exploration\nof their maps and therefore healthy.Who knows?I don't know what they do with\ntheir time in every domain of life.But once again, we come back to this\nimportance of understanding what'sin those cupboards, what's in those\npillars, as a not just important butcritical step in understanding and\nbuilding ourselves in positive ways.And as I said once or twice before in this\nseries, but I'm going to say it again,and I'm sure again and again before we\nconclude this series, is that what'sso attractive about this map is that\nit sets a very clear and simple set ofideals, not necessarily simple to attain.And as you've said, it takes time,\nbut agency, concept and gratitude,empowerment, humility, leading up\nto peace, contentment and delight,all as action states, not as passive\nstates to just bask in and disappear.And this notion of the generative drive.And by now, in this episode, I'm sure\npeople are well on board the understandingthat the generative drive is not just\nabout going out and doing things.It's about doing things in service to\nand in a way that supports learning,knowing, creating, not just of\nothers and in the world, but inside.Paul Conti: Yes.I love the map imagery because you can\nalmost see the map changing, right?As the person, I imagine the person\nis busying away in the cupboards.Oh, there's a lot to\nwork on in this cupboard.And they're busying away and they're doing\nthe work, and we can see the map changing.That path that looked like a really\ngood path actually goes through a swamp.We didn't see the swamp on the map.Now it appears on the map.That other path that looked\nlike it's a little circuitous.That's a good path.It might be a harder path.It is a little circuitous, but\nlook where it leads, right?The map becomes clear as we\ndo the work on ourselves.Andrew Huberman: Yes.And also the understanding that you've\nlaid out for us here really helpsavoid a lot of the common pitfalls that\nare associated with sticky language.And sticky for good reason.I mean, what's stickier and more\ninteresting for people that are interestedin themselves, in relationship than\nthings like boundaries or labels likeanxious, attached, or secure, attached.And I'm not being disparaging of\nthose labels, but I'm realizingthose are just labels, right?They don't define action items and\nspecific lines of inquiry to get us backinto our self understanding over and over.Not as a full time job, right?We all have to live our lives, but\nas a way actually to be more leanedinto life in the outside world.Paul Conti: Those labels define people no\nbetter than the numerical diagnoses in thepsychiatric taxonomy book that we glorify.Labels are not understanding.Numbers are not understanding.They can help.Taxonomies are good.Sometimes labels let us categorize\nthings, but labels are not asubstitute for understanding.Numbers are not a substitute\nfor understanding.If we look at ourselves, we get\nreal understanding, and that'swhat makes the difference.That's what bolsters agency,\ngratitude, all those good things.Clear mentalization, greasing\nthe wheels of progress more, thegenerative drive getting stronger.We really can find goodness, and often do.And that's why I think everything\nwe're t alking about is very hopeful.It acknowledges there's complexity.There are pitfalls.There are all sorts of things to it that\nwe need to be aware of and to beware of.But that doesn't mean that ultimately\nit isn't positive that we're notspeaking to, hey, whatever it is that's\nailing you, that thing can be better.Andrew Huberman: Well, I'm so grateful\nthat you're sharing your knowledge andexperience around all of this with us\nand that you've laid out such a clearand logical and deep and tractable,\nreally actionable understandingof all this that we can engage in.It's tremendously powerful.Paul Conti: Thank you.I so appreciate it.Thank you.Andrew Huberman: Thank you for joining\nme for today's discussion about how"

    "episode_summary": "This is episode 3 of a 4-part special series on mental health with Dr. Paul Conti, M.D., a psychiatrist who did his medical training at Stanford School of Medicine and residency at Harvard Medical School. He is the author of the book, \u201cTrauma: The Invisible Epidemic.\u201d Dr. Conti explains how to find, develop and strengthen healthy relationships \u2014 including romantic relationships, work and colleague relationships, and friendships. He explains a roadmap of the conscious and unconscious mind that can allow anyone to navigate conflicts better and set healthy boundaries in relationships. We also discuss common features of unhealthy relationships and clinically supported tools for dealing with relationship insecurity, excessive anxiety, past traumas, manipulation and abuse. Dr. Conti explains how, in healthy relationships, there emerges a dynamic of the mutually generative \u201cus\u201d and how to continually improve that dynamic. The next episode in this special series explores true self-care, which can be cultivated through a process of building self-awareness along with other important practices.\u00a0\u00a0\nFor the full show notes, visit hubermanlab.com.\nThank you to our sponsors\nAG1:\u00a0https://drinkag1.com/huberman\nBetterHelp: https://betterhelp.com/huberman\nWaking Up: https://wakingup.com/huberman\nEight Sleep:\u00a0https://eightsleep.com/huberman\nMomentous:\u00a0https://livemomentous.com/huberman"
