            "text": "welcome to the huberman Lab podcast where we discuss science and science-based tools for everyday life I'm Andrew huberman and I'm a professor of neurobiology and Ophthalmology at Stanford school of medicine today my guest is Dr Matthew McDougall Dr Matthew McDougall is the head neurosurgeon at neurolink neurolink is a company whose goal is to develop Technologies to overcome specific clinical challenges of the brain and nervous system as well as to improve upon brain design that is to improve the way that brains currently function by augmenting memory by augmenting cognition and by improving communication between humans and between machines and humans these are all of course tremendous goals and neurolink is uniquely poised to accomplish these goals because they are approaching these challenges by combining both existing knowledge of brain function from the fields of Neuroscience and neurosurgery with robotics machine learning computer science and the development of Novel devices in order to change the ways that human brains work for the better today's conversation with Dr Matthew McDougall is a truly special one because I and many others in science and medicine consider neurosurgeons the astronauts of Neuroscience in the brain that is they go where others have simply not gone before and are in a position to discover incredibly novel things about how the human brain works because they are literally in there probing and cutting stimulating Etc and able to monitor how people's cognition and behavior and speech changes as the brain itself has changed structurally and functionally today's discussion with Dr McDougall will teach you how the brain works through the lens of a neurosurgeon it will also teach you about neuralink specific perspective about which challenges of brain function and disease are immediately tractable which ones they are working on now that is as well as where they see the future of augmenting brain function for sake of treating disease and for simply making brains work better today's discussion also gets into the realm of devising the peripheral nervous system in fact one thing that you'll learn is that Dr McDougall has a radio receiver implanted in the periphery of his own body he did this not to overcome any specific clinical challenge but to overcome a number of daily everyday life challenges and in some ways to demonstrate the powerful utility of combining novel machines novel devices with what we call our nervous system and different objects and Technologies within the world I know that might sound a little bit mysterious but you'll soon learn exactly what I'm referring to and by the way he also implanted his family members with similar devices so while all of this might sound a little bit like science fiction this is truly science reality these experiments both the implantation of specific devices and the attempt to overcome specific movement disorders such as Parkinson's and other disorders of deep brain function as well as to augment the human brain and make it work far better than it ever has in the the course of human evolution are experiments and things that are happening now at neuralink Dr McDougall also generously takes us under the hood so to speak of what's happening at neurolink explaining exactly the sorts of experiments that they are doing and have planned how they are approaching those experiments we get into an extensive conversation about the utility of animal versus human research in probing brain function and in devising and improving the human brain and in overcoming disease in terms of neurosurgery and neural links goals by the end of today's episode you will have a much clearer understanding of how human brains work and how they can be improved by Robotics and engineering and you'll have a very clear picture of what neural link is doing toward these goals Dr McDougall did his medical training at the University of California San Diego and at Stanford University School of Medicine and of course is now at neurolink so he is in a unique stance to teach us about human brain function and dysfunction and to explain to us what the past present and future of brain augmentation is really all about before we begin I'd like to emphasize that this podcast is separate from my teaching and research roles at Stanford it is however part of my desire and effort to bring zero cost to Consumer information about science and science related tools to the general public in keeping with that theme I'd like to thank the sponsors of today's podcast our first sponsor is hvmn Ketone IQ hvmn Ketone IQ increases "

            "text": "Andrew great to see you again uh we'll get into our history a little bit later but just to kick things off as a neurosurgeon and as a neuroscientist can you share with us your vision of the brain as an organ as it relates to what's possible there I mean I think most everyone understands that the brain is along with the body the seat of our cognition feelings our ability to move Etc and the Damage there can limit our ability to feel the way we want to feel or move the way we want to move but surgeons tend to view the world a little bit differently than most because as the not so funny joke goes you know they like to cut and they like to fix and they like to mend and they in your case have the potential to add things into the brain that don't exist there already so how do you think about and conceptualize the brain as an organ and what do you think is really possible with the brain that most of us don't already probably think about yeah that's a great question thinking about the brain as this three pound lump of meat trapped in a prison of the skull it seems almost magical that it could create a you know human a human set of behaviors and a life merely from electrical impulses when you start to see patients and see say a small tumor eating away at a little part of the brain and see a very discrete function of that brain go down in isolation you start to realize that the brain really is a collection of functional modules pinned together duct taped together um in this in this bone box attached to your head um and sometimes you see very interesting failure modes so one of the most memorable patience I ever had was very early on in my training I was down at UC San Diego and saw a very young guy who had just been in a car accident we had operated on him and you know as is so often the case in neurosurgery we had saved his life potentially at the cost of quality of life when he woke from surgery with bilateral frontal lobe damage he had essentially no impulse control left and so you know we rounded on him after surgery saw that he was doing okay to our you know first guess at his uh health and we continued on to see our other patients and we were called back by his you know 80 year old recovery room nurse saying you've got to come see your patient right away something's wrong and we walk in to see him and he points at his elderly nurse and says she won't have sex with me and you know it was Apparent at that moment his frontal lobes were gone and that person is never going to have reasonable human behavior again um and uh that's you know it's one of the most tragic ways to have a brain malfunction but uh you know anything a brain does anything from control of hormone levels in your body to Vision to sensation to you know the most obvious thing which is muscle movement of any kind from eye movement to moving your bicep all that comes out of the brain all of it can go wrong any of it any part of it or all of it um so yeah working with the brain is the substance of the brain as a surgeon very high stakes but you know once in a while you get a chance to really help you get a chance to fix something that seems unfixable and you have you know lazarus-like Miracles not not too uncommonly so it's extremely satisfying as a career could you share with us one of the more satisfying experiences or perhaps the top Contour of what um qualifies as satisfying in in neurosurgery yeah um you know one of the relatively newer techniques that we do is you know if someone comes in with a reasonably small tumor somewhere deep in the brain that's hard to get to the traditional approach to taking that out would involve cutting through a lot of good normal brain and disrupting a lot of neurons a lot of white matter that you know kind of the wires connecting neurons um then the modern approach involves a two millimeter drill hole in the skull down which you can pass a little fiber optic uh cannula and and uh attach it to a laser and just heat the tumor up deep inside the brain under direct MRI visualization in real time so your this person is in the MRI scanner you're taking pictures every second or so as the tumor heats up you can monitor the temperature and get it exactly where you want it where it's going to kill all those tumor cells but not hurt hardly any of the brains surrounding it and so not uncommonly nowadays we have someone come in with a tumor that previously would have been catastrophic to operate on and we can eliminate that tumor with you know leaving a poke hole in their skin with almost no visual After Effects so that procedure that you just described translates into better clinical outcomes meaning fewer let's call them side effects or collateral damage exactly right yeah we don't you know even in cases that previously would have considered totally inoperable say a tumor in the brain stem or a tumor in primary motor cortex or primary verbal areas Brokers area uh where we would have expected to either not operate or do catastrophic damage those people sometimes now are coming out unscathed I'm very curious about the sorts of "

            "text": "basic information about brain function that can be gleaned from these clinical approaches of lesions and um strokes and um maybe even stimulation so for instance in your example of this patient that had bilateral frontal damage what do you think his lack of Regulation reveals about the normal functioning of the frontal lobes because I think the obvious answer to most people is going to be well the frontal lobes are normally um limiting impulsivity right but as we both know because the brain has excitatory and inhibitory neurons to sort of accelerators and breaks on communication right that isn't necessarily the straightforward answer um it could be for instance that the frontal lobes are acting as conductors right and are kind of um important but not the immediate players in determining impulsivity so um two questions really what do you think the frontal lobes are doing because I'm very intrigued by this uh human expanded real estate we have a lot of it compared to other animals and more generally what do you think damage of a given neural tissue means in terms of understanding the basic function of that tissue yeah it varies I think from tissue to tissue but with respect to the frontal lobes I think they act as sort of a filter they selectively are saying backward to the rest of the brain behind them when part of your brain says that looks very attractive I want to go grab it and take it you know out of the jewelry display case or you know whatever the frontal lobes are saying you can if you go pay for it first right they're filtering the behavior they're they're letting the impulse through maybe uh but in a controlled way um this is very high level very broad uh thinking about how the frontal lobes work and that that patient I mentioned earlier is a great example of when they go wrong you know he had this impulse sort of strange impulse to be attracted to his nurse that normally it would be easy for our frontal lobes to say this is completely inappropriate wrong setting wrong person wrong time uh in his case he had nothing there and so even the slightest inclination to uh to want something came right out to the surface so um yeah a filter calming the rest of the brain down from acting on every possible impulse when I was a graduate student I was um running what are called you know these uh what these are but just to inform you what are called acutes which are um neurophysiological experiments that last several days because at the end you uh you terminate the animal this isn't uh my apologies to those that um are made uncomfortable by animal research I now work on humans so a different type of animal but at the time we were running these acutes that would start one day and maybe end two or three days later and so you get a lot of data the animals anesthetized and doesn't feel any pain the entire time of the surgery but the um one consequence of these experiments is that the experimenter me and another individual are awake for several days with an hour of sleep here an hour of sleep there but you're basically awake for two three days something that really I could only do in my teens and 20s I was in my 20s at the time and I recall um going to eat at a diner after one of these experiments and I was very hungry and the waitress walking by with a tray full of food for another table and it took every bit of self-control to not get up and take the food off the tray something that of course is totally inappropriate and I would never do and it must have been based on what you just said that my forebrain was essentially going offline or offline from the sleep deprivation right because there was a moment there where I thought I might reach up and grab a plate of food passing by simply because I wanted it right and um I didn't um but I can relate to the experience of feeling like the shh response is a flickering in and out under conditions of sleep deprivation so do we know whether or not sleep deprivation limits for brain activity in a similar kind of way you know I I don't know specifically if that effect is more pronounced in the forebrain as opposed to other brain regions but it's clear that sleep deprivation has broad effects all over the brain people start to see visual hallucinations so the opposite end of the brain as you know the visual cortex in the far back the brain is affected people People's Court motor coordination goes down after sleep deprivation so um I think you know if I if you force me to give a definitive answer on that question I'd have to guess that the entire brain is affected by sleep deprivation and it's not clear that one part of the brain is more effective than another so we've been talking about damage to "

            "text": "the brain and inferring function from damage uh maybe we could talk a little bit about what I consider really the Holy Grail of the nervous system which is neuroplasticity this incredible capacity of the nervous system to change its wiring strengthen connections weaken connections maybe new neurons but probably more strengthening and weakening of connections right nowadays we hear a lot of excitement about so-called classical psychedelics like LSD and psilocybin which do seem to quote unquote open plasticity they do a bunch of other things too but um through the release of neuromodulators like serotonin and so forth how do you think about neuroplasticity and more specifically what do you think the potential for neuroplasticity is in the adult so let's say older than 25 year old brain with or without machines being involved because um in your role at neurolink and as a neurosurgeon in other clinical settings surely you are using machines and surely you've seen plasticity in the positive and negative direction right what do you think about plasticity what's possible there without machines what's possible with machines so as you mentioned or alluded to the plasticity definitely goes down in older brains uh it it is harder for older people to learn new things to make radical changes in their behavior uh to you know kick habits that they've had for years um machines aren't the obvious answer so implanted electrodes and computers aren't the obvious answer to increased plasticity necessarily compared to drugs we already know that there are pharmacologics some of the ones you mentioned psychedelics that have a broad impact on plasticity yeah it's hard to know which area of the brain would be most potent as a stimulation Target for an electrode to broadly juice plasticity compared to uh you know pharmacologic agents that we already know about I think with plasticity you're talking in general you're talking about the entire brain you're talking about altering you know a trillion synapses all in a similar way in their tendency to be rewireable to their tendency to be up or down weighted and an electrical stimulation Target in the brain necessarily has to be focused you know with a device like potentially neural links there might be a more broad ability to steer current to multiple targets with some degree of control but you're never going to get that broad um Target ability with uh any electrodes that I can see coming in our lifetimes so say that would be coding the entire surface and depth of the brain the way that a drug can and so I think plasticity research will bear the most fruit when it focuses on pharmacologic agents I wasn't expecting that answer given that you're at neural "

            "text": "link and um and then again I think that all of us me included need to take a step back and realize that while we may think we know what is going on at neurolink in terms of the specific goals and the general goals and I certainly have in mind I think most people have in mind a chip implanted in the brain or maybe even the peripheral nervous system that can give people super memories or some other augmented capacity we really don't know what you all are doing there and for all we know um you guys are taking or administering psilocybin and combining that with stimulation I mean we really don't know and I say this um with a with a tone of excitement because um I think that one of the things that's so exciting about the different Endeavors that Elon has really spearheaded um SpaceX Tesla Etc is that early on there's there's a lot of Mystique right you know Mystique is a quality that um is not often talked about but um it's I think a very exciting time in which Engineers are starting to toss up big problems and go for it and obviously Elon is certainly among the best if not the best in terms of going really big I mean Mars seems pretty far to me right electric cars are all over the road nowadays are very different than the picture a few years ago right when you didn't see so many of them rockets and so forth and now the brain so to the extent that you are allowed could you share with us what your vision for the missions at neurolink are and what the general scope of missions are and then um if possible uh share with us some of the more specific goals I can imagine basic goals of trying to understand the brain and augment the brain I could imagine clinical goals of trying to repair things in humans that are suffering in some way or animals for that matter yeah it's it's funny what you mentioned uh neuralink and I think Tesla and SpaceX before it end up being these blank canvases that people project their hopes and fears onto and so we we experience a lot of upside in this people you know assume that we have superpowers in our ability to alter the way brains work and people have terrifying fears of the horrible things we're going to do uh for the most part those extremes are not true uh you know we are making a neural implant we have a robotic insertion device that helps Place tiny electrodes the size uh smaller than the size of a human hair all throughout a small region of the brain in in the first indication that we're aiming at we are hoping to implant a series of these electrodes into the brains of people that have had a bad spinal cord injury so people that are essentially quadriplegic they have perfect brains but they can't move use them to move their body they can't move their arms or legs because of some high-level spinal cord damage exactly right and so this you know pristine motor cortex up in their brain is completely capable of operating a human body it's just not wired properly any longer to a human's arms or legs and so our goal is to place this implant into a motor cortex and have that person be able to then control a computer so a mouse and a keyboard as if they had their hands on a mouse and a keyboard even though they aren't moving their hands their motor intentions are coming directly out of the brain into the device and so they're able to regain their digital freedom uh and connect with the world through the internet why use robotics to insert these chips and the reason I asked that is that sure I can imagine that a robot could be more precise or less precise but in theory more precise than the human hand no tremor for instance right um uh more Precision in terms of uh maybe even a little micro detection device on the the tip of the blade or or something that could detect a capillary that you would want to avoid and swerve around that the human eye couldn't detect and you and I both know however that no two brains nor are the two sides of the same brain identical right so navigating through the brain is perhaps best carried out by a human however and here I'm going to interrupt myself again and say 10 years ago face recognition was very clearly performed better by humans than machines and I think now machines do it better right so is this the idea that eventually or maybe even now robots are better surgeons than humans are in in this limited case yes uh these electrodes are so tiny and the blood vessels on the surface of the brain so numerous and so densely packed that a human physically can't do this a human hand is not steady enough to grab this you know couple Micron width Loop uh at the end of our electrode thread and place it accurately uh blindly by the way into the cortical surface accurately enough at the right depth to get through all the cortical layers that we want to reach and I would love if human surgeons were you know essential to this process "

            "text": "there's a long history uh dating back really prior to the 1950s of scientists doing experiments on themselves sure not because they are Reckless but because they want the exact sorts of information that you're talking about the ability to really understand how intention and awareness of goals can shape outcomes in biology if that is vague to people listening what I mean here is that for many probably hundreds of years if not longer scientists have taken the drugs they've studied or stimulated their own brain or done things to really try and get a sense of what the animals they work on or the patients they work on might be experiencing psychiatrists are sort of famous for this by the way right I'm not pointing fingers at anybody but psychiatrists are known to try the drugs that they administer right and some people would probably imagine that's a good thing just so that the clinicians could have empathy for the sorts of side effects and not so great effects of some of these drugs that they administer to to patients but the confidence test I present you is would you be willing or are you willing if allowed to have these electrodes implanted into your motor cortex yeah you're not a quadriplegic right you can move your limbs yeah but given the state of the technology at neurolink now would you do that or maybe in the next couple of years if you were allowed would you be willing to do that yeah and be the person to say hey turn up the stimulation over there I feel like I want to reach for the cup right with that robotic arm but I'm feeling kind of some resistance because it's exactly that kind of experiment done on a a person who can move their limbs and who deeply understands the technology and the goals of the experiment that I would argue actually stands to advance the technology fastest sure as opposed to putting the electrodes first into somebody who um is imperative a number of levels and then trying to think about why things aren't working right right and again that you know this is all with the the goal of of reversing paralysis in mind um but would you implant yourself with these microelectrodes yeah absolutely I I would be excited to do that I think for the first iteration of the device it probably wouldn't be very meaningful it wouldn't be very useful because I can still move my limbs and our first outputs from this are things that I can do just as easily with my hands right moving a mouse typing in a keyboard um we are necessarily making this device as a medical device for starters for people with bad medical problems and no good options it wouldn't really make sense for an able-bodied person to get one in the near term it as the technology develops and we make devices specifically designed to perform functions that can't be done even by an able-bodied person say eventually refine the technique to get to the point where you can type faster with your mind and one of these devices than you can with text to speech or speech to text and your fingers that's a use case that makes sense for someone like me to get it it doesn't really make sense for me to you know get one when it allows me to you know use a mouse slightly worse than I can with my hand currently that said the safety of the device I would absolutely vouch for from you know the hundreds of surgeries that I've personally done with this I I think it's much safer than many of the industry standard FDA approved surgeries that I routinely do on on patients that you know are no one even thinks twice about their standard of care neurolink is already reached in my mind a safety threshold that is far beyond a commonly accepted safety threshold along the lines of augmenting one's biological function or functions in the world I think now's the appropriate time to talk about the small lump uh present in the top of your hand for those listening not watching there's a it looks like a a small lump between um Dr mcdougall's forefinger and thumb or index finger and thumb um placed on skin on the top of his hand you've had this for some years now because we've known each other for gosh probably seven years now or so and you've always had it in the time that I've known you what is that lump um and why did you put it in there yeah so it's a small writable RFID tag what's an RFID what does RFID stand for yeah radio frequency identification and so it's just a very small implantable chip that wireless devices can temporarily power if you approach an antenna they can power and send a small amount of data back and forth so most phones have the capability of reading and writing to this chip for years it it let me into my house it unlocked a deadbolt on my front door for some years it unlocked the doors at neuralink and let me through you know the the various locked doors inside the building um it is writable I can write a small amount of data to it and so for some some years in early uh the early days of crypto I had a crypto private key written on it to store a cryptocurrency that I thought was you know a dead offshoot of one of the main uh crypto currencies after it forked and so I put the private wallet key on there and forgot about it and remembered a few years later that it was there and went and checked and it was worth you know a few thousand dollars more than when I had left it on there so that was a nice finding change in the sofa in the 21st century and then when you say you read it you're essentially taking a a phone or other device and scanning it over the the lump in your hand so to speak and then it can read the data from there yeah essentially yeah um what other sorts of things could one put into these rfids in theory and how long can they stay in there before you need to take them out and um yeah and recharge them or replace them well these are passive they're coded in biocompatible glass and as an extra I'm a rock climber and so I was worried about that glass shattering during rock climbing I additionally coated them in another ring of silicone before implanting that so it's it's pretty safe they're passive there's no battery there's no Active Electronics in them so they could last the rest of my life I don't think I'd ever have to remove it for any reason you know at some point the technology is always improving so I might remove it and upgrade it that's not inconceivable already there's you know 10x more storage versions available that could be a drop in replacement for this if I ever remove it but you know that it it has a small Niche use case and it's an interesting proof of concept tiptoeing towards the concept that you mentioned of you know you have to be willing to go through the things that you're suggesting to your patients in order to you know say with a straight face that you think this is a reasonable thing to do so a small subcutaneous implant in the hand is a little different than a brain implant but yeah what's involved in getting that RFID chip into the hand is it I'm assuming it's an outpatient procedure presumably you did it on yourself yeah yeah this was a kitchen table kind of procedure um any anesthetic or is or no you know I um I've seen people do this with lidocaine injection I for my money I think a lidocaine injection is probably as painful as just doing the procedures a little cut in that thin skin on the top of the hand right some people are cringing right now other people are saying I want one because you'll have to never worry about losing your keys yeah or passwords I actually would like them for passwords because I'm dreadfully bad at uh remembering passwords I have to put them in places uh all over the place and then it's like I'm like that kid in um remember that movie Stand by me where the kid hides the pennies under the the porch and then uses the map yeah spends all summer trying to wind them so I can relate uh yeah so a little it was just a little slit and then put in there no local immune response no no pus no swelling all the materials are completely biocompatible that are on the surface exposed to the body so no no bad reaction it healed up you know in days and it was fine very cool um since we're on video here maybe can you just uh maybe raise it and show us yeah so so were you not to point out uh that little lump I I would have known to to ask about it but and uh any other members of your family have have these a few years after having this and seeing the convenience of me being able to open the door without keys uh my wife insisted that I put one in her as well so she's walking around with one fantastic we consider them our sort of our our version of wedding rings love it well certainly um more permanent than wedding rings in in some sense um "

            "text": "I can't help but ask this question even though it might seem a little bit off topic as long as we're talking about implantable devices and Bluetooth and RFID chips in the body I get asked a lot about um the safety or lack thereof of a Bluetooth headphones um you work on the brain you're a brain surgeon um that's valuable real estate in there and um you understand about electromagnetic fields and sure um any discussion about emfs immediately puts us in the category of uh oh like get their tin foil hats and yet I've been researching emfs for a future episode of the podcast sure and emfs are a real thing that's not a valuable statement everything's a real thing at some level even an idea but there does seem to be some evidence that electromagnetic fields of sufficient strength can alter the function of maybe the health of but the function of neural tissue given that neural tissue is electrically signaling among itself so um I'll just ask this in a very straightforward way do you use Bluetooth headphones or wired headphones yeah Bluetooth and you're not worried about any kind of EMF Fields across the skull no I mean I I think the energy levels involved are so tiny that uh you know ionizing radiation aside we're way out of the realm of ionizing radiation that people would worry about you know tumor causing EMF Fields even just the electromagnetic field itself as is very well described in a Bluetooth frequency range the power level are tiny in these devices and so you know we are Awash in these signals whether you use Bluetooth headphones or not for that matter you're you're getting bombarded with ionizing radiation in a very tiny amount no matter where you live on earth unless you live under huge amounts of water um it's unavoidable uh and so I think you just have to trust that your body has the DNA repair mechanisms that it needs to deal with the constant bath of ionizing radiation that you're in uh as a result of being in the universe and exposed to cosmic rays in terms of electromagnetic fields there it's just it's uh you know the energy levels are way way out of the range where I would be worried about this what about heat um you know I don't use the earbuds any longer for a couple of reasons once as you know I take a lot of supplements and I reach into my left pocket once and swallowed a handful of supplements that included a Bluetooth a airpod pro um I knew it I swallowed it the moment after I gulped it down by the way folks please don't do this it was not a good idea it was it wasn't an idea it was a mistake and but I could see it on my phone as registering there never saw it again so I'm assuming it's no longer in my body but um uh anyway there's a bad joke there to be sure um but in any event I tend to lose them or misplace them so that's the main reason but I did notice when I used them that there's some heat generated there um I also am not convinced that plugging your ears all day long is good there's some ventilation through the through the sinus systems that include the ears so it sounds to me like you're not concerned about the use of of um earbuds but um what about heat near the brain I mean there's the the cochlea the auditory mechanisms that sit pretty close to the surface there um heat and neural tissue are not friends sure um I'd much rather get my brain cold than hot yeah um in terms of keeping the cells healthy and Alive um should we be thinking about the heat effects of some of these devices or other things is there anything we're overlooking well think about it this way the uh I use cars as an analogy a lot and you know mostly internal combustion engine cards so these analogies are gonna start to be foreign and useless for another generation of people that grow up in the era of electric cars but using cars as a as a platform to talk about uh fluid cooling systems your body has a massive distributed fluid cooling system similar to a car's radiator you're pumping blood all around your body all the time at a very strictly controlled temperature that blood carries it's mostly water so it carries a huge amount of the heat away or cold away from any area of the body that's focused heating or focused cooling so you could put an ice cube on your skin until it completely melts away and the blood is going to bring heat back to that area you can put you can stand in the sun under much more scary heating Rays from the Sun itself that contain UV radiation that's that's definitely damaging your DNA if you're looking for things to be afraid of the sun is a good one now you're talking to the guy that tells everybody he got sunlight in their eyes every morning but I don't want people to get burned or give themselves skin cancer I encourage people to protect their skin accordingly and and different individuals require different levels of protection from the Sun sure some people do very well in a lot of sunshine never get basal cell or anything like that some people and it's not just people with very fair skin a minimum of sun exposure can cause some issues and here I'm talking about sun exposure to the skin of course staring at the sun is a bad idea I never recommend thinking about the sun just as a heater uh you know for for a moment to compare it with Bluetooth headphones your body is very capable of carrying that heat away and dissipating it you know via sweat evaporation or you know temperature Equalization so any heat that's locally generated in the ear you know one there's a pretty large bony barrier there but two there's a ton of blood flow in the scalp and in the head in general and definitely in the brain that's going to regulate that temperature so I think certainly there can be a tiny temperature variation but I doubt very seriously that it's enough to cause a significant problem I'd like to go back to brain augmentation you've "

            "text": "made very clear that one of the first goals for neurolink is to get quadriplegics walking again and again what a marvelous goal that is and I certainly hope you guys succeed well again just just to be very clear the first step is we we aren't reconnecting the patient's own muscle system to their motor Court allowing them um excuse me uh agency over the movement of things in the world yes and eventually their body and you're exactly right yeah eventually their body we would we would love to do that and we've done a lot of work on uh developing a system for stimulating the spinal cord itself and so that gets to the question that you uh that you asked a few minutes ago of how do you reconnect the motor cortex to the rest of the body well if you can bypass the damaged area of the spinal cord and have an implant in the spinal cord itself connected to an implant in the brain and have them talking to each other you can take the perfectly intact motor signals out of the the motor cortex and send them to the spinal cord which most of the wiring should be intact in the spinal cord below the level of say the the injury caused by a car accident or motorcycle accident or gunshot wound or whatever and it should be possible to reconnect the brain to the body in that way so not out of the realm of possibility that you know in some small number of years that neuralink will be able to reconnect to somebody's own body to their brain and here I just want to flag the um 100 years or more of incredible work by basic scientists um the names that I learned about in my textbooks as a graduate student were like georgeopolis and um that won't mean anything to anyone unless you're a neuroscientist but churchopolis um performed some of the first sophisticated recordings out of motor cortex just simply asking like what sorts of electrical patterns are present in motor cortex as an animal or human move is a limb um Krishna shinoy being another um major Pioneer in this area and many others right and just really highlighting the fact that basic research where a exploration of neural tissue is carried out at the level of anatomy and physiology really sets down the pavement on the runway to do the sorts of big clinical uh Expeditions that you all at neurolink are doing yeah it can't be said enough that you know we broadly speaking in Industry sometimes are and sometimes stand on the shoulders of academic Giants they were the real Pioneers that they were involved in the grind for years in an unglorious unglamorous way no stock option no stock options and you know the reward uh for all the hard work is a paper at the end of the day that is read by you know dozens of people and so you know they were selfless uh academic researchers that that made all this possible and we all humanity and neuralink owe them a massive debt of gratitude for all the hard work that they've done and continue to do I agree I'd like to just take a brief moment and thank one of our podcast sponsors which is inside tracker inside tracker is a personalized nutrition platform that analyzes data from your blood and DNA to help you better understand your body and help you reach your health goals I've long been a believer in getting regular blood work done for the simple reason that blood work is the only way that you can monitor the markers such as hormone markers lipids metabolic factors Etc the impact your immediate and long-term Health one major challenge with blood work however is that most of the time it does not come back with any information about what to do in order to move the values for hormones metabolic factors lipids Etc into the ranges that you want with inside tracker changing those values becomes very straightforward because it has a personalized dashboard that you can use to address the nutrition-based behavior-based supplement-based approaches that you can use in order to move those values into the ranges that are optimal for you Your vitality and your longevity inside tracker now includes a measurement of APO lipoprotein B so-called apob in their ultimate plan apob is a key marker of cardiovascular health and therefore there's extreme value to knowing your apob levels if you'd like to try inside tracker you can go to insidetracker.com huberman to get 20 off any of inside tracker's plans again that's inside tracker.com huberman to get 20 off along the lines of augmentation early on "

            "text": "in some of the public discussions about neurolink that I overheard between Elon and various podcast hosts Etc there were some lofty ideas set out that I think are still very much in play in people's minds things like for instance electrical stimulation of the hippocampus that you so appropriately have worn on your shirt today so for those they have beautiful um looks like either a it looks like a Golgi or a kahal rendition of the hippocampus yeah translates to seahorse and it's an area of the brain that's involved in learning and memory and among other things there was this idea thrown out that a chip or chips could be implants in the hippocampus that would allow greater than normal memory abilities perhaps that's one idea sure another idea that I heard about in these discussions was for instance that you would have some chips in your brain and I would have some chips in my brain and you and I could just sit here look at he looking at each other or not nodding or shaking our heads and essentially hear each other's thoughts which sounds outrageous but of course why not why should we constrain ourselves um to uh as our good friend Eddie Chang and uh who's a neurosurgeon who was already on this podcast once before said speech is just the shaping of breath as it exits our lungs incredible really when you think about it but we don't necessarily need speech to hear and understand each other's thoughts because the neural signals that produce that shaping of the lungs come from some intention you know I have some idea although it might not seem like it about what I'm going to say next so is that possible that we could sit here and just hear each other's thoughts and um and also how would we restrict what the other person could hear yeah well so absolutely I mean think about the fact that we could do this right now if you pulled out your phone and started texting me on my phone and I looked down and started texting you we would be communicating without looking at each other or talking shifting that function from a phone to an implanted device it requires no magic Advance no Leap Forward it's technology we already know how to do if we say put a device in that allows you to control a keyboard and a mouse which is our stated intention for our first human clinical trial or and against I'm deliberately interrupting or I can text an entire team of people sure simultaneously and they can text me and in theory I could have a bunch of thoughts and 5 10 50 people could hear right um or um probably more to their preference um they could talk to me yeah and and so you know texting each other with our brains is maybe an uninspiring rendition of this but it it's not uh very difficult to imagine the implementation of the same device in a more verbally focused area of the brain that allows you to more naturally speak the thoughts that you're thinking and have me have them rendered into speech that I can hear uh you know maybe via a bone conducting implant so silently here or or not silently like I could let's say I was getting off the plane and I wanted to let somebody at home know that I had arrived I might be able to think in my mind think their first name which might cue up a device that would then play my voice to them and just got off the plane I'm gonna grab my bag and then I'll give you a call right on their home Alexa right so that's all possible meaning we know the origin of the neural signals that give us rise to speech we know the different mechanical and neural apparati like the cochlea um eardrums Etc that transduce sound waves into electrical signals right essentially all the pieces are known we're just really talking about like refining it yeah refining it and reconfiguring it it's I mean it's not an easy problem but it's really an engineering problem rather than a neuroscience problem for that for that use case you know for a non-verbal communication you might say um that's a solved problem in a very crude disjointed way uh so some Labs have solved you know part one of it some Labs have solved part two of it there are products out there that solve you know say the implanted bone conduction part of it for the for the deaf Community um there are there are no implementations I'm aware of that are pulling all that together into one product that's a streamlined package from end to end I think that's a few years down the road and we I think have some hints of how easily or poorly people will adapt to these um let's call them novel Transformations a few years ago I was on Instagram and I saw a post from a woman um her name is cassar Jacobson and she is deaf since birth and can sign and to some extent can relapse but she was um discussing uh neosensory so this is a a device that translates sound in the environment into touch Sensations on her hand or wrist she's a uh admirer of birds and all things Avian and um I reached out to her about this device because I'm very curious because this is a very interesting use case of of neuroplasticity in the sensory domain which is a fascination of mine and she said that um yes indeed it afforded her novel experiences now when walking past say pigeons in the park if they were to make some whatever sounds that pigeons make that she would feel those sounds and that indeed it enriched her experience of those birds um in ways that obviously it wouldn't otherwise I haven't followed up with her recently to find out whether or not ongoing use of neosensory has made for a better worse or kind of um equivalent experience of avians in the world which were her is a near Obsession um so she Delights in them um what are your thoughts about in a peripheral devices like that periphery peripheral meaning outside of the the skull no requirement for a uh a surgery do you think that there's a more immediate or even a uh just generally potent um use case for peripheral devices and do you think that those are going to be used more readily before the kind of brain surgery requiring devices are used yeah um certainly the barrier to entry is lower the barrier to adoption is low you know if you're making a tactile glove that's hard to say no to when you can slip it on and slip it off and not not have to get your skin cut at all um what you know again there's no perfect measure of the efficacy of a device of one device compared to another especially across modalities but one one way that you can start to compare apples to oranges is bitrate you know useful information in or out of the brain as you know transformed into digital data and so you can put a single number on that and you have to ask when you look at a device like that is what is the bit rate in what is the bit rate out how much information are you able to usefully convey into the system and get out of the system into the body into the brain and uh I think there's what we've seen in the early stabs at this is that there's a very low threshold for bit rate on some of the devices that are trying to avoid you know a direct brain surgery Could you um perhaps say what you just said but in a way that um maybe people who aren't as familiar with thinking about bitrate might um might be able to digest there I'm referring to myself um I mean I understand bitrate I understand that adding a new channel of information is just that adding information are you saying it's important to understand whether or not that new information provides for novel function or experience and to and um to what extent is the the newness of that valid and adaptive well I'm saying more uh it's hard to measure utility in this space it's hard to you know put a single metric single number on how useful a technology is one crude way to try to get at that is is uh bit rate think of it as as back in the days of dial-up modems the bit rate of your modem was you know 56k or 96 I can still hear the sound of the dial up in the background yeah that was a bit rate that thankfully kept steadily going up and up and up your your internet service provider gives you a number uh that is the maximum usable data that you can transmit back and forth from the internet that's a useful way to think about these assistive devices how much information are you able to get in into the brain and out of the brain usefully and right now that that number is very small even compared to the old modems but you have to ask yourself when you're looking at a technology what's the ceiling what's the theoretical maximum and for a lot of these Technologies the theoretical maximum is is very low disappointingly low even if it's perfectly executed and and perfect developed as a technology and I think the thing that attracts a lot of us to a technology like neuraling is that the ceiling is incredibly High there's no obvious reason that you can't interface with millions of neurons as this technology is refined and and developed further so that's the kind of wide band you know high bandwidth brain interface that you want to develop if you're talking about um and a semantic prosthetic uh an AI assistant to your cognitive abilities uh you know the more sci-fi things that we think about in the coming decades um so uh it's an important caveat when you're evaluating these Technologies they really want it to be something that you can expand off into the Sci-Fi so let's take this a step further "

            "text": "because as you're saying this I'm realizing that people have been doing exactly what neurolink is trying to do now for a very long time let me give you an example um people who are blind who have no pattern Vision have used canes for a very long time now the cane is not a chip it's not a an electrode it's not neosensory right none of that stuff what it is is essentially a a stick that has um an interface with a surface so it swept back and forth across the ground and you're translating what would otherwise be visual cues into somatosensory cues sure and we know that blind people are very good at understanding um even when they are approaching say a curb Edge because they are integrating that information from the tip of the cane um up through their somatosensory cortex and their motor cortex with other things like the changes in the the wind and the sound as they round a corner and um here I'm imagining a like a corner in San Francisco downtown which you get to the corner it's a completely different set of auditory cues and very often we know and this is because my laboratory worked on visual repair for a long time I talked to a lot of blind people who use different devices to navigate the world that they aren't aware of the fact that they're integrating these other cues but they nonetheless do them subconsciously right um and in doing so get pretty good at navigating with a cane right now Kane isn't perfect but you can imagine the other form of of navigating as a blind person uh which is to just attach yourself or attached to you another nervous system the best that we know being a dog sighted dog sure that can cue you again with a stopping at a curb's edge or even if there are some individuals that might seem a little sketchy dogs are also very good at sensing um different uh arousal States and others threat danger sure I mean they're Exquisite at it right so here what we're really talking about is taking a cane or another biological system essentially a whole nervous system and saying this other nervous system's job is to get you to navigate more safely through the world right in some sense what neurolink is trying to do is that but with robotics to insert them and chips which raises the the question people are going to say finally a question the question is this we hear about BMI brain machine interface which is really what neuraling specializes in we also hear about AI another example where there's great promise and great fear right we hear about machine learning as well to what extent can these brain machine interfaces learn the same way a seeing eye dog would learn but unlike a seeing eye dog continue to learn over time and get better and better and better because it's also listening to the nervous system that it's trying to support right put simply what is the role for AI and machine learning in the type of work that you're doing that's a great question I think you know it goes both ways basically what you're doing is taking a very crude software intelligence I would say not exactly a full full-blown AI but it's some well-designed software that can adapt to changes in firing of the brain and you're coupling it with another form of intelligence a human intelligence and you're allowing the two to learn each other so undoubtedly the human that has a neuralink device will get better at using it over time undoubtedly the software that the neurolink engineers have written will adapt to the firing patterns that that the device is able to record and over time focus in on meaningful signals toward movement right so if a neuron is fire a high firing rate when you intend to move the mouse cursor up and to the right it doesn't know that when it starts when you first put this in it's just a random series of signals as far as the chip knows but you start correlating it with what the person what you know the person wants to do as expressed in a series of games so you you assume that you know that the person wants to move the mouse on the screen to the Target that's shown because you tell them that's the goal and so you start correlating the activity that you record when they're moving toward an up and right Target on a screen with that firing pattern and similarly for up and left down and left down and right and so you develop a model um semi-intelligently in the software for what the person is intending to do and let the person run wild with it for a while and they start to get better at using the model presented to them by the by the software as expressed by the mouse moving or not moving properly on the screen right so it's imagine a scenario where you're asking somebody to play piano but the the sound that comes out of each key randomly shifts over time um very difficult problem but a human brain is good enough with the aid of software to solve that problem and and map well enough to a semi-stable state that they're going to know how to use that Mouse even when they say turn the device off for the night come back to it the next day and some of the signals have shifted so you're describing this I'm I'm recalling a recent experience I got one of these um rowers you know for to exercise and I am well aware that there's a proper row stroke and there's a improper row stroke and most everybody including me who's never been coached in rowing gets on this thing and pushes with their legs and pulls with their arms and back and it's some mix of Incorrect and maybe a smidgen of correct type execution there's a function within the rower that allows you in this case I mean to play a game where you can actually um every row stroke you generate arrows on toward a dartboard and it knows whether or not you're generating the appropriate forces at the given segment to the row the initial pull when you're leaning back Etc and adjusts the trajectory of the arrow so that when you do a proper row stroke it gets closer to a bullseye and it's very satisfying because you now have a visual feedback that's unrelated to this um the kinds of instructions that one would expect like oh you know hinge your hip a bit more or you know splay your knees a bit more reach more with your arms or pull first with your back all the rowers are probably cringing as I say this because they're realizing the what is exactly the point which is I don't know how to row but over time simply by paying attention to whether or not the arrow is hitting the bullseye or not more or less frequently you can improve your row stroke and get as I understand pretty close to Optimal row stroke in the same way that if you had a coach there telling you hey do this and do that what we're really talking about here is neurobiofeedback sure so is that analogy similar to what you're describing yeah that's a great analogy you know humans are really good at learning how to play games in software so video games are an awesome platform for us to use as a training environment for people to get better at controlling these things in fact it's it's the default and the obvious way to do it is to have people and monkeys play video games do you play video games yeah sure which video games let's see I you know play old ones I'm a little nostalgic so uh I uh like the old Blizzard game Starcraft and Warcraft I don't even know those I remember the first Apple computers I mean I go how old are you uh 43 okay 44 now as of a few days ago happy birthday so we're a little bit offset there yeah I can recall um Mike Tyson's punch out like the original Nintendo game Super Mario Brothers um but the game so the games you're describing I don't recall that my understanding is that the newer games are are far more sophisticated in some respects I I did recently find time to play cyberpunk um which was really satisfying and maybe appropriate it's a game where the characters are all fully modded out with cybernetic implants well perfect um but you know the the root of the game is run around and shoot things so maybe not so different from you know duck hunt or whatever from our childhoods the reason I ask about video games is um there's been some controversy as to whether or not they are making young brains better or worse and I think some of the work from Adam gazzali's Lab at UCSF and other Laboratories have shown that actually provided that um children in particular and adults are also spending time in normal face to let's call them more traditional face-to-face interactions that video games can actually make nervous systems that is people a much more proficient at learning and motor execution sure um visual detection um and on and on yeah there's some work uh showing that surgeons are better if they play video games so I try to squeeze some in as a you know a professional development activity great great well I'm sure you're getting cheers from the uh from those that like video games out there and some of the parents who are trying to get their kids to play fewer video games are cringing but that's okay we'll let them settle uh they're familial disputes among themselves let's talk about pigs sure "

            "text": "neural link has been um quite generous I would say in announcing their discoveries and their goals and I I want to highlight this because I think it's quite unusual for a company to do this um I'm probably going to earn a few enemies by saying this um despite the fact that I've always owned Apple devices and from the South Bay um you know the apple design team is notoriously cryptic about what they're going to do next or when the next phone or computer is going to come out is is is vaulted to um a serious extent neural link has been pretty open about their goals right with the understanding the goals change and have to change and one of the things that they've done which I think is marvelous is they've held online symposia where you and some other colleagues of mine from the Neuroscience committee Dan Adams who have tremendous respect for and Elon and others their neural link have shared some of the progress that they've made in experimental animals I'm highlighting this because I think if one takes a step back I mean just for most people to know about and realize that there's experimentation on animals implantation of electrodes and so on is itself a pretty bold move because that understandably evokes some strong emotions um in people and in some people evokes extremely strong emotions sure um neural link did one such Symposium where they showed implant devices in pigs right then they did another one you guys did another one where it was implant devices in monkeys right I assume at some point there will be one of these public symposia where um the implant devices will be in a human what was the rationale for using pigs I'm told pigs are very nice creatures yeah I'm told that they are quite smart right um and for all my years as a neuroscientist and having worked admittedly on every species from mice to cuttlefish to humans to hamsters to uh you know I confess um various carnivore species which I no longer do I work on humans now for various reasons I never in my life thought I would see a implant device in the cortex of a pig sure why work on pigs yeah well let me let me say first neurolink is almost entirely composed of animal loving people the people at norlink are obsessive animal lovers there are signs up all around the office you know spontaneously put up by people within the organization you know talking about how we want to save animals we want to protect animals if there was any possible way to help people the way we want to help people without using animals in our research we would do it it's just not known how to do that right now and so we are completely restricted to making advances to getting a device approval through the FDA by first showing that it's incredibly safe in animals and so as is the case for any medical advancement essentially exactly I do want to highlight this that the the FDA and the other governing bodies um oversee these types of experiments and ensure that they're done with a minimum of discomfort to the animals of course but um I think there's an inherent speciesism right in uh in most humans not all some people truly see equivalence between a lizard and a human lizard life being equivalent to human life most human beings I think in particular human beings who themselves or have loved ones that are suffering from diseases that they hope could be cured at some point view themselves as species and feel that if you have to work on a biological system in order to solve the problem um working on non-human animals first makes sense right to most people sure but certainly there's a category of people that feels very strongly in the opposite direction sure and you know I think we would probably be having a very different conversation around animal research if uh we weren't you know we as a species we as a culture weren't just casually slaughtering millions of animals to eat them um every single day and so that is a background against which that the relatively minuscule number of animals used in research it becomes almost impossible to understand why someone would point to that ridiculously small number of animals used in research when the vast vast majority of animals that humans use and end their lives are are done for food or for fur or for fur or these other reasons that people you know have historically used animals so we in in that context we do animal research because we have to there's no other way around it if tomorrow uh laws were changed and the FDA said okay you can do some of this early experimentation in willing human participants that would be a very interesting option I think there would be a lot of people that would step up and say yes I'm willing to participate in early stage clinical research you already volunteered uh yeah um and I wouldn't be alone and that you know is a potential way that animals could maybe be spared uh being unwilling participants in this on that note to whatever extent possible I think neuralink goes um really really far much much farther than anyone I've ever heard of any organization I've ever heard of any anything I've ever seen to give the animals agency in every aspect of the research we have just an incredible team of people looking out for the animals and trying to design the experiments such that they're as purely opt-in as humanly possible no animal is ever compelled to participate in experiments beyond the surgery itself so if say on a given day our our star monkey pager doesn't want to play video games for Smoothie no one forces them to ever this is a very important point and I want to cue people to really what Matt is saying here um obviously the animals are being researched on for neural links so they don't get to opt in to opt out of the experiment right um but what he's saying is that they play these games during which neural signals are measured from the brain because they have electrodes implanted in their brain through a surgery that thankfully to the brain is painless right no pain receptors in the brain um and are playing for reward this is very different very different than the typical scenario in Laboratories around the world where people experiment on mice monkeys some kisses pigs or other species in which the typical Arrangement is to water deprive the animals we never do that and then have the animals work for their daily ration of water right and some people are hearing this and probably think wow that's barbaric and here I'm not trying to point fingers at the people doing that kind of work I just think it's important that people understand how the work is done right in order to motivate an animal to play a video game right depriving them of something that they yearn for is a very efficient way to do that we don't do that we they have free and full access to food this entire time so they aren't hungry they aren't thirsty the only thing that would motivate them is if they want a treat extra to their normal rations but there's there's never any deprivation there's never any adverse negative stimuli that pushes them to do anything I must say I'm impressed by that decision um because uh training animals to do tasks in laboratory settings is very hard and the reason so many researchers have defaulted to water deprivation and and having animals work for a ration of water is because frankly it works right it allows people to finish their PHD or their postdoc more quickly than having to wait around um and try and figure out why uh their monkey isn't working that day in fact having known a number of people who've done these kinds of experiments although we've never done them in my lab my monkey isn't working today is a common uh gripe among graduate students and postdocs who do this kind of work um and for people who work on mice okay so this is um uh very important information to get across and there's no Public Relation statement uh woven into this is just we're talking about the nature of the research but I think it is important that people are aware of this yeah it's one of the one of the underappreciated Innovations out of neurolink is how far the Animal Care team has been able to to move in the direction of Humane treatment of these guys wonderful as an animal lover myself I can only say wonderful why pigs yeah pigs are you know they're actually fairly commonly used in medical device research um more you know in the cardiac area their hearts are you know somewhat similar to human hearts how big are these pigs I've seen Little Pigs and I've seen big pigs yeah there's a range there's a bunch of different varieties of pig there's a bunch of different species that um you know you can optimize for different uh characteristics there's mini pigs there's um you know Yorkshires there's uh a lot of different kind of pigs that we use in different contexts when we're trying to optimize a certain characteristic so yeah the pigs are we don't necessarily need them to be smart or task performers although occasionally we have you know trained them to walk on a treadmill when we're studying how their limbs move for some of our spinal cord research um but we're not you know recording interesting say cognitive data out of their minds they're really just a biological platform with a skull that's close enough in size and shape to humans to be a valid platform to study the safety of the device unlike a monkey or a human a pig I don't think can reach out and hit a button or a lever exactly how are they signaling that they um saw or um sent to something yeah so again the pigs are really just a safety platform to say the device is safe to implant it doesn't you know break down or cause any kind of toxic reaction the monkeys are where we are really doing our heavy lifting in terms of ensuring that we're getting good signals out of the device that that what we expect to see in humans is validated on a functional level in in monkeys first let's talk about the skull yeah years "

            "text": "ago you and I were enjoying a conversation about these very sorts of things that we're discussing today and he said you know the skull is actually a pretty lousy uh biological adaptation far better would be a titanium plate You Know spoken like a true neurosurgeon uh with a radio receiver implanted in his hand um but in all seriousness you know drilling through the skull with a two millimeter hole certainly don't do this at Home Folks um please don't do this but um that yes that's a small um entry site but I think most people cringe when they hear about that or think about that sure and it obviously has to be done by a neurosurgeon with all the appropriate um uh environmental conditions in place to limit infection what did you mean when you said that the skull is a poor adaptation in a titanium plate will be better and in particular what does that mean in reference to things like traumatic brain injury I mean are human beings unnecessarily vulnerable at the level of traumatic brain injury because our skulls are just not um hard enough you know maybe I'm being too harsh about skull the skull is uh very good at what it does given the tools that we are working with as biological organisms that develop in our mother's uterus the skull is you know usually the appropriate size it's one of the hardest things in your body um that said there are a couple puzzling vulnerabilities some of the thinnest bone in the skull is in the temporal region this is uh you know neurosurgeons will all know that I'm heading toward a feature that sometimes Darkly is called God's Little joke where the very thin bone of the of the temporal um part of the skull has one of the largest arteries that goes to the lining of the brain right attached to the inside of it and so this this bone just to the side of your eye tends to fracture if you're struck there and the sharp edges of that fractured bone very often cut an artery called the middle meningeal artery that leads to a big blood clot that crushes the brain that's how a lot of people with you know otherwise would be a relatively minor injury end up dying is this large blood clot developing from high pressure arterial blood that crushes the the brain and so why would you put the artery right on the inside of the very thin bone that's most likely to fracture it's an enduring mystery but this is probably the most obvious failure mode in in you know the design of a human skull otherwise you know in terms of General impact resistance I think the brain is a very hard thing to protect and the the architecture of human anatomy probably given all other possible architectures that can arise from development it's not that bad really um one of the interesting features in terms of shock absorption that hopefully prevents a lot of traumatic brain injury is the fluid sheath around the brain the the brain you may know is um it's mostly fat it floats in salt water in our brains so our brains are all floating in in salt water and so with rapid acceleration deceleration that sheath of salt water adds a marvelous protective cushion against development of you know bruising of the brain say or bleeding in the brain and so I think for any flaws in the design that do exist um you can imagine things being a lot worse and there's probably a lot fewer tbis than would exist if a human designer was taking a first crack at it as you describe the the thinness of this temporal bone and the in the presence of a critical artery just beneath it um I'm thinking about most helmets um and here I also want to cue up the fact that while whenever we hear about TBI or CTE or brain injury people always think football hockey but most traumatic brain injuries are things like car accidents or construction work right and it's not football and hockey for some reason football and hockey and boxing get all the attention but my colleagues that work on traumatic brain injury tell me that most of the traumatic brain injury they see is somebody slips at a party and hits their head or um uh you know was in a car accident or environmental environmental accidents of various kinds to my mind most helmets don't actually cover this region close to the eyes so is there is there also a failure of um helmet engineering that um you know I can understand why you'd want to have your peripheral vision out the sides of your eyes uh per free of your eyes but it seems to me if this is such critical real estate why why isn't it being better protected you know I'm no expert in helmets but um I don't think we see a lot of epidural hematomas and squirts injuries to get this kind of injury you usually need a really focal blunt trauma like the baseball bat to the head is a classic mechanism of injury that would lead to to a temporal bone fracture an epidural hematoma um with sports injuries you know you don't often see that especially in football with uh you know a a sharp sharper object coming in contact with the head it's usually another helmet right is the the mechanism of injury uh so I I I can't think off the top of my head of an instance of this exact injury type in sports you spent a lot of time poking around in "

            "text": "earlier discussion about neuroplasticity you made an interesting statement which is that we are not aware of any single brain area that one can stimulate in order to invoke plasticity right it's a malleability of neural architecture years ago Mike mirzanek and colleagues at UCSF did some experiments where they stimulate nucleus basalis and paired that stimulation with eight kilohertz tone or um in some cases they could also stimulate a different brain area the ventral tegmental area which causes the release of dopamine and pair it with a tone and in it seemed in every one of these cases they observed massive plasticity um now I look at those data and I compare them to the kind of classic data um I think it was Carl Ashley that did these experiments where they would take animals and they'd scoop out a little bit of Cortex put the animal back into a learning environment and the animal would do pretty well if not perfectly sure so they scoop out a different region of Cortex and a different animal and by the end of maybe three four years of these kinds of lesion experiments they um referred to the equal potential of the cortex meaning they concluded that it didn't matter which piece of the cortex you took out that there was no one critical area so on the one hand you've got these experiments that say you know you don't really need a lot of the brain right and and every once in a while a news story will come out where um they'll a patient a person will go in for a brain scan for some other reason or an experiment and the person seems perfectly normal and they're like missing half their cortex right and then on the other hand you have these experiments like the stimulation of basalus or VTA where you get massive plasticity from stimulation in one area I was I've never been able to reconcile these kinds of discrepant findings and so I'd really like just your opinion on this you know what is it about the brain as an organ that lets it be both so critical at the level of individual neurons in circuits so so critical and yet at the same time um it's able to uh circumvent these what would otherwise seem like massive lesions and holes in itself yeah I mean a lot of a lot of it to reconcile those experiments you first account for the fact that they're probably in different species right you take out a particular portion of a pig or a rabbit grain a small amount you might not see a difference but a small portion of a human brain say the part most interested in coordinating speech or finger movement and you're going to see profound losses or visual cortex right I take out a small portion of V1 and you'll you'll have a visual deficit um and so species matters uh age matters if you take out half of the brain in a very young baby that baby has a reasonable chance of developing High a high degree of function by having the remaining half subsume some of the functions lost on the other side because they're very very young and their brain is still developing it's a it's to some degree a blank slate with extremely high plasticity over many years so that can overcome a lot of deficits um taking an adult animal's brain that isn't very well differentiated functionally to begin with you might not see those deficits so apparently there's a lot of redundancy as well right there's a lot of say cerebellar and spinal circuits in other animals that generate stereotyped Behavior patterns and might not need the brain at all to perform say a walking movement or some other sequences of motor activities so a lot of that depends on the experimental setup I would say in general adult humans are very vulnerable to losing small parts of their brains and losing discrete functions I'm going to take the liberty of asking "

malfunctions of the brain are what drives me these are the things that I want to tackle in my career you know in terms of my kids lifetime I'm thinking you know full human expansion of human cognition into AI full immersion in the internet of your cognitive abilities having no limitation for what you think um as bottlenecked by needing to read the Wikipedia article first to have the data to inform your thoughts having communication with anyone that you want to unrestricted by this you know flapping air past meat on your face it's a you know a means of communication that's ridiculously prone to being misunderstood it's also a tiny narrow bottleneck of communication where you know trying to send messages back and forth through a tiny straw and there's no reason that needs to necessarily be true it's the way things have always been but it isn't the way things are going to be in the future uh and I think there's a you know a million very sci-fi possibilities in terms of banding human Minds together to be even more potent as a as a multi-unit uh organism uh you know as an opt-in multi-brain uh you know these are things that are so far down the road I can't even directly see how they would be implemented but the technology we're working on is a little crack in the door that allows some of this stuff to even be thought about in a realistic way well to that to that point I you know encourage anyone who is you know excited about things like that you know especially mechanical engineers software Engineers robotics engineers come to the neuralink website and look at the jobs we've got we need the brightest people on the planet working on these the hardest problems uh in the world in my opinion and so if you want to work on this stuff come help us I have several responses and to what you just said um first off I'll get the the least important one out of the way which is that years ago I applied for a job at neurolink the neural link website at that time was incredibly sparse right it was just said neural link and I said if you're interested give us your email so I put my email there I got no response so um the uh they made a wise choice in um now uh fast forward several years I am um very grateful and I think very lucky um that you who passed through fortunately for me through my lab at one point and we had some fun Expeditions together in the wild uh neural exploration so we can talk about some other time as well as I'm learning from you as you pass through your time at Stanford um but have arrived there at neurolink and and I'll say that they're very lucky to have you and um folks like Dan Adams who have known for your very long time so uh phenomenal neurosurgeons like yourself neuroscientists and um Vision scientists like Dan and others it's really an incredible Mission so I really want to start off by saying um thank you to you and all your colleagues there I know that neurolink is really tip of the spear in being public facing with the kinds of things they're doing and and being so forthcoming about how that work is done in animals and exactly what they're doing um and that's a very brave stance to take yeah especially given the nature of the work but well that's classic Elon right he he doesn't keep secrets in public too commonly he tells you what he's going to do and then he does it and people are always amazed by that you know he releases the Tesla master plan and tells you exactly what the company intends to do for the next several years and people assume that there's some subterfuge that he is misdirecting but it's it's right out there in the open and I think neuraling follows in that path of you know we want people to know what we're doing we want the brightest people in the world to come help us we we want to be able to help patients we want you know the most motivated patients with quadriplegia to you know visit our patient registry uh and and sign up to be considered for clinical trials that that will happen in the future we'll put a link to that by the way so um maybe just uh the direct call could happen now so you uh this is for people who are quadriplegic or who know people who are quadriplegic who are interested in being part of this clinical trial it's a patient registry right now that we're just collecting information to see who might be eligible for clinical trials that'll happen in the future we're still working with the FDA to hammer out the details and and get their final permission uh to proceed with the trial great so please see the note in the show note the link excuse me in the in the show note captions for that yeah I want to thank you guys for your stance uh being public facing and also doing the incredibly hard work I also think the robotics aspect which you've clarified for me uh today is extremely Forward Thinking and uh absolutely critical so a lot of critical engineering that note out will Wick out into other domains of neurosurgery and medical technology not just serving neural links Mission directly and I really want to thank you uh first of all for coming here today and taking time out of your important schedule of seeing patients and doing brain surgery literally time away from your family and time away from your mission at neurolink briefly to uh to share with people what you guys are doing as I mentioned before there's a lot of Mystique around it and even despite the fact that neurolink has gone out of their way to try and erase some of that Mystique this to me is the clearest picture ever to my knowledge that has been given about what's going on there and and the the stated and the real Mission and what's going on at the level of of nuts and bolts and and guts and brains and this kind of thing and I really just want to thank you also for for being you which is uh perhaps sounds like a a kind of an odd um thing to hear but I think as made apparent by the device implanted in your hand you don't just um do this for a job you live and breathe and embody truly embody this stuff around the nervous system and trying to figure out how to fix it how to make it better and you live and breathe it and I know your deep love for it so I want to thank you for um not just the brains that you put into it and the energy you put into it but also for the the heart that you put into it thanks for that Andrew I appreciate that we we just want to help people we want to make things better well I know that to be true knowing you and um thank you again for coming here today and I look forward to another round of discussion and um whenever the time happens to be when these incredible technologies have um spelled out to the next uh major Milestone thank you thank you for joining me for today's "

    "episode_summary": "In this episode, my guest is Matthew MacDougall, MD, the head neurosurgeon at Neuralink. Dr. MacDougall trained at the University of California, San Diego and Stanford University School of Medicine and is a world expert in brain stimulation, repair and augmentation. He explains Neuralink\u2019s mission and projects to develop and use neural implant technologies and robotics to 1) restore normal movement to paralyzed patients and those with neurodegeneration-based movement disorders (e.g., Parkinson\u2019s, Huntington\u2019s Disease) and to repair malfunctions of deep brain circuitry (e.g., those involved in addiction). He also discusses Neuralink\u2019s efforts to create novel brain-machine interfaces (BMI) that enhance human learning, cognition and communication as a means to accelerate human progress. Dr. MacDougall also explains other uses of bio-integrated machines in daily life; for instance, he implanted himself with a radio chip into his hand that allows him to open specific doors, collect and store data and communicate with machines and other objects in unique ways. Listeners will learn about brain health and function through the lens of neurosurgery, neurotechnology, clinical medicine and Neuralink\u2019s bold and unique mission. Anyone interested in how the brain works and can be made to work better ought to derive value from this discussion.\nFor the full show notes, visit hubermanlab.com.\nThank you to our sponsors\nAG1 (Athletic Greens): https://athleticgreens.com/huberman\nLMNT: https://drinklmnt.com/huberman\nWaking Up: https://www.wakingup.com/huberman\nMomentous: https://www.livemomentous.com/huberman"
