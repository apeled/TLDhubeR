            "text": "of not just having fresh bright teethand no cavities and fresh breath or atleast lack of bad breath one would hopebut also total body Health as Imentioned a little bit earlier oralhealth is inextricably linked to allaspects of brain and bodily Health bothin the short term and in the long termand it is perhaps the most overlookedaspect of mental health and physicalhealth so today I'd like to start offwith a quiz I'm going to ask you whichof the following three categories youbelieve you best fall into okay thefirst category is those of you out therewho brush and floss every day probablytwice a day and who make some effort totry and keep your teeth clean who likethe feeling of your teeth being cleanand who pay a fair amount of attentionto whether or not your teeth are gettingwhiter or not getting whiter maybewhether or not your breath is fresh ornot fresh maybe okay these aren'trequirements for being in this categorybut maybe you're somebody who also usesa mouthwash or uses mints or gums inorder to try and keep your mouthsmelling and looking fresh and yourmouth clean okay so this first categoryuh does not require that you do all ofthose things but let's just make a basicrequirement of participation in thiscategory that you routinely brush atleast twice a day and that you floss atleast once a day okay if you fall intothat category you are in category oneand by the way if you're in category oneand you do those things and you do abunch of other things like toothwhitening and maybe you go to thedentist especially often more than therecommended twice per year that stillputs you in category one okay secondcategory are those of you out there whoare let's say a bit more blas\u00e9 aboutyour oral and tooth care those of youthat perhaps just brush your teeth inthe morning so that your breath is freshyou clean out that kind of stickyfeeling in your mouth that's accumulatedovernight that sometimes brush and maybefloss at night but you know a lot oftimes you fall asleep without doing thator you don't feel like doing it orperhaps that don't really floss at allokay that perhaps go to the dentist onceevery 6 months maybe a little less maybeonce a year once every couple years sowhile there's a bunch of differentthings that could put you into Category2 let's make a basic requirement forbelonging to Category 2 that you brushyour teeth once a day but not twice aday on a regular basis or that you brushtwice a day but that you rarely flossokay that would put you into what I'mcalling category to and then of coursethere's the third category that maybesome of you out there fall into and thisis the CATE ategory of people who areextremely diligent not just about toothcare but also about oral healthgenerally about maintaining themicrobiome of your mouth about makingsure that your gums are very healthyabout making sure that your soft palletand hard palet is very healthy aboutmaking sure that yes your teeth areclean that they're devoid of as muchbacterial buildup and other stuff inthere that can cause cavities but alsothat you're paying careful attention toyour oral micro probiome and the overallmilu of your health in the mouth and thefact that your mouth is linked to allthese different aspects of brain andcardiac and metabolic Health okay if youfall into that third category great butlet's be honest most people I wouldargue 95 maybe even 98% of people ormore fall into either category one orcategory two so as you're hearing thisyou're probably thinking okay well ifI'm in category one I'm good right I goto the dentist twice a year I brush infloss use some mouthwash I even brightenmy teeth I you know I make sure that ifI had a sugary meal I'll rinse out mymouth I try not to drink acidic Foodsthings that we'll discuss today as towhether or not they actually haverelevance for cavity formation ornot but guess what if you are incategory one as I described it orcategorytwo chances are you are doing things toreally deplete and disrupt your oralhealth that's right even if you'repaying a lot of attention to toothHealth chances are if you're like mostpeople out there simply because youdon't have the latest information onwhat oral health really is and how tobest support it chances are you aredoing things that yes might be keepingyour teeth white and clean and you'renot getting cavities or you're not beingtold you have cavities that need to befilled when you go to the dentist twicea year or more but that you aredisrupting your oral health in ways thatare depleting other aspects of yourbrain and bodily health and I'm not hereto scare you I'm just here to tell youthat if you're in category one okayyou're clearly doing some things thatare beneficial for you but that there'ssome additional things that you can doand a few things to avoid doing thatvery likely will improve your overallbily health very quickly and the goodnews is those things are also zero orlow cost or in some cases can save yousubstantial cost now if you're incategory two chances are you aredepleting both your oral health and youroverall bodily Health but here's what'sinteresting some of the folks inCategory 2 that are not doing as muchfor the let's say hygiene and fresheningand whitening of their teeth actuallyhave a healthier overall oral microbiomethat's not always the case but often itcan be the case so what you're going todiscover today is whether you're incategory 1 or Category 2 there are somewonderful and easily accessiblepractices that are well backed byscience and by the way in preparationfor this episode I also consulted withno fewer than five dentists including apediatric dentist I talked to aperiodontist I talked to people who fallinto the functional dentist category Italk to people with a bunch of differentorientations who are all heavilyqualified to talk about and to makerecommendations about oral health andtooth Health Etc and what I'm going todeliver today is essentially the overlapin the vend diagram of what they allagreed on I'll highlight a fewdifferences that they each had and thatseveral of them they do fall intodifferent camps but I was positivelysurprised how much overlap or consensusthere was in terms of best protocols fortooth and oral health and by the way ifyou're in that third category of theperson that's doing a lot for theirtooth health and appearance and breathEtc but also oral health and microbiomeI'm sure that today you'll also learnsome new health practices and somethings that will allow you to expand onyour already terrific practices for oralhealth so let's get into the material"

            "text": "about oral health focusing first on twotooth anatomy and health and some alittle bit about mouth Anatomy I promiseto not go into this in too much depthbut we really need to have a firm basisa foundation of understanding of whatthe mouth cavity really consists of andI'm not just going to throw a bunch ofnames out there for sake of nomenclatureI don't need to Cloud your hippocampuswith that sort of information unlessit's functional information but it iscritical functional information for therest of our discussion where we'll talkabout ways that you can really build upthe strength of your teeth even ifcavities have already started to formand how to really get your saliva to bethe best healthiest saliva for youroverall mouth and for your gut and foryour brain your heart Etc okay so let'stalk just briefly I promise brieflyabout the anatomy and a little bit ofthe physiology of the this stuff okaythe teeth we're all familiar with whatteeth are and the tongue the tonsils inthe back of the mouth we have our softpallette hard pallet gums let's talk alittle bit about how all that fitstogether centering around the thing thatmost people think about when they thinkabout oral health and that's the teethit's just a good jumping off point forus your teeth are layered structureslike pretty much every structure in yourbody is a layered structure it's justthe way those structures form cells areborn at one location they migrate outand form Stacks or layers thosedifferent layers have different celltypes and your teeth are no exception sowhile there are different kinds of teethin yourmouth teeth have an outer layer which isthe enamel the enamel believe it or notis not white it is translucent light canmake it through but it's not transparentit's not like a clear window it'stranslucent light can make it throughbut it's a bit opaque okay beneath theenamel is a structure called DentinDentin is important for today'sdiscussion because as it turns outcavities form not surprisingly from theoutside of teeth Inward and Cavities asthe name suggests are holes thatbacteria burrow down through the enamaland if you're unlucky make it down tothe Dentin our goal meaning your goalgoal is to engage in Daily protocolsthat's right daily protocols that aresimple and fast and zero or very lowcost that allow you to avoid theformation of those cavities yes but alsothat can allow you to fill in thosecavities this is one of the mostimportant things to understand aboutoral health that frankly I didn't knowuntil I started researching this episodeand talking to all these experts in thefield which is that you can repaircavities that have started to formthat's right your mouth environmentbased on its chemistry and some thingsthat are mechanical but mostly based onits chemistry in particular how acidicit is or how basic it is is always in astate of what's called eitherdemineralization orremineralization now those words arehard to say and they're especially hardto say fast so demineralizationremineralization it's a little bit of atongue twister today I'm going to use ashorthand that's a convention in theDentistry field which is De Min or reminto refer to demineralization orremineralization remineralization isgood it is the process by which withinthe enamel and to some extent in thedeeper Dentin layer of the tooth butespecially within the enamel there canbe the addition of new minerals thatform very robustessentially chains of crystals okay ifyou've ever looked at a crystal of anykind under a microscope or you've seen apicture of it they are incredibly wellorganized they form a lattice of verystrong often although they're weakercrystals too very strong bonds andstructure it's like the structure of areally well-formed building okayremineralization is the process ofputting minerals back into that crystalstructure and it's actually possible tofill back in those cavities thatbacteria have started to form especiallywhen those cavities have burrowed downinto the enamel but have not yet made itinto the Dentin layer of the tooth orteeth okay this is very important tounderstand it's especially important tounderstand the context of the fact thattypically not always but typically ifyou have a cavity formed at one toothand let's say it's just halfway or 3/4of the way through the enamel layer thatif you have cavities elsewhere in yourmouth chances are that they are at thesame depth or level not always butchances are and that's great news ifthose cavities have not yet made it intothe dtin layer why is it great news wellI don't know about you but I don't likehaving my teeth drilled I don't likehaving cavities drilled and filled I hada very traumatic childhood with respectto dentistry and oral health I'll talkabout it a little bit later in theepisode it's not that I had tons andtons of cavities I actually had thisother issue where my adult teeth came inbehind my baby teeth I had have all mybaby teeth pulled I had to get a bunchof injections of Novacane in my mouth Ididn't like getting injections into mymouth so I opted to have any cavities Ihad drilled without Novacane it's notcuz I was a tough little kid althoughthat definitely toughened me up it wasbecause I hated having syringes in mymouth I might have even bitten a dentistor two or three I don't bite the dentistanymore I thank the dentist by the way Ithink dentists are wonderful regularcleanings are wonderful we'll talk aboutfrequency of cleanings but here's thepoint if you are somebody who enjoysgetting your teeth drilled well then Idon't know what to say but if like mostpeople out there with proper wiring ofyour neurology well then you don't likegetting your teeth drilled and you canavoid it in many cases by remineralizingthat enamel layer of your teeth now ifthere's a demineralization down to thedeeper Dentin layers of the tooth thenmost often you're going to need it to bedrilled drilled and filled as they sayor as some people say which is a bitmore cynical drill fill and buildbecause you get charged for that or yourinsurance gets charged for that okayback to some tooth anatomy and mouth"

            "text": "Anatomy we talked about the enamel layerof the tooth on the outside I told youthat it either can demineralize demminor remineralize remin this is a keyPoint your teeth are always in a stateof either demon or remen that's righteither demon or remen it's not both atthe same time it's one or the other andit is largely dependent on the p that isthe acidity of your mouth which islargely dependent on how much salivayou're producing and the mineral contentof that saliva keep that in mind I thinkit's a very important point now anotherkey point is that next to your teethright you have your gums the gingiva asit's called now the gingiva provides areally important role in keeping theteeth stable we don't often think of itlike that but even though that stuffseems gummy and soft it is soft tissueit is very important for fixing theteeth to the Bone it's not just aboutthe roots that extend down into theJawbone below the gums are veryimportant for keeping the teeth wherethey are there's actually a littleligament too between gums and the teeththat resides a little bit deeper but thegums form a critical barrier between theoral cavity and the deeper layers ofwhat eventually is bone and into thegeneral blood flow or bloodstream of thebody now this is so important tounderstand that the gums are a sealaround the tooth this is why when you goto the dentist they're paying attentionwith that little pick they're payingattention to how high or hopefully lowthe tenting is the the the littlerecesses or pockets of gums along thethehere in my mouth yes I'll try not to dothat during today's episode point to myteeth so much so that I'm then you knowyou can't understand what I'm sayingthat the gums are providing a sealbetween the oral cavity and essentiallythe bone and the general bloodstream nowthis is so critical because let's justtake a step back and think about theoral cavity and what a remarkable placeit is think about it this is a gapinghole in our body okay we have some othergaping holes in our body but those tendto be sphincter based holes yes Irealize there probably some Chuckles assoon as you say sphincter like yes theanal sphincter okay we're anatomistswe're biologists we can talk about thatstay shut stuff is generally not goingup there and if it is not very oftenokay your nasal passages yeah those areholes but you know there's a lot ofstuff there there's mucus to catch stuffthere's a CRI form plate there's a bonethere's a bunch of things that act asbarriers between the nasal cavities andthe Brain which sits right behind it theolfactory bulb and yes we have eyes andthen you know we have the outside of theeyes and there's a you know asusceptibility there but we have ourblink reflex there's a also an ocularmicrobiome there's a bunch of thingsthere but think about the just thisgaping hole in the front of our facethat we use to eat and speak and breatheokay it's a huge hole and as aconsequence it's filled with bacteriafrom our outside environment all daylong all day long sometimes at nightalthough we're going to talk later aboutthe critical critical need to be a nasalbreather at night and not a mouthbreather not just for sake of stavingoff sleep apnea but also because turnsout the dryness of the mouth is one ofthe ways that you really can throw offyour oral health in major ways in factit's one of the leading causes of toothdecay in people like methamp addicts orif you see people that are mouthbreathers their oral health and theirteeth generally but certainly their oralhealth is severely depleted so you'vegot this big hole in your front of yourface and you're talking and eating andmoving about during the day even ifyou're a nasal breather when you're nottalking or eating and all this bacteriais getting in and it's a really moistenvironment and it's really warm so thecombination of bacteria moist and warmmeans that this thing is like a petridish for growing stuff that couldpotentially be really bad for us but butit has this incredible feature which isthat if the pH is right then the badstuff is killed off doesn't make it intoour system doesn't disrupt our oralhealth or our bodily Health it also hasa critical feature which is that thebacteria that are good for usproliferate and supports the sealingprocess of the gums against the teethand tooth health and tongue health andpallet Health Etc okay so the oralcavity is Amazing by virtue of howvulnerable it is but also how robust itis and the way it stays robust is bykeeping the saliva healthy now there areother ways too but that's one of themain ones and it's a huge portal intothe rest of the body and if the oralcavity isn't amazing to you alreadybased on what you've heard thus farthink about this if you get a cut onyour arm or your hand or your shinunless you're one of these remarkablepeople that always heals up without ascar as long as you're about 25 years orolder typically you'll form a little bitscar there'll be something noticeablethere the oral cavity also can take cutsand burns and things like thatunfortunately those things occur butwith rare exception heals up with nearlyzero scarring sometimes there's a scarbut nearly zero scarring which isremarkable why well it's basically anopen wound with a bunch of bacteria init and it's warm and it's moist soclearly there's something special goingon in this thing that we call the oralcavity indeed there is and it's anchoredin the fact that if we treat it rightyou can encourageremineralization how do you do that bykeeping the saliva healthy how do you dothat by supporting the proper bacteriawithin the mouth and making sure thatyou're eliminating the bacteria that youdon't want or at least limiting thosebacteria and today we're going to talkabout how to do that and by virtue ofdoing all the things that support toothHealth you're also going to support gumhealth okay those gums are criticalbecause they form that barrier that ifit gets too big if those Pockets thoserecesses get too big and you're nottaking care of the bacteria in yourmouth when you're not getting rid of thebad bacteria those bacteria worm theirway down into the deeper recesses nearthe roots of the tooth sometimes intothe tooth we'll talk about that and canget down into the bone and then cancause serious serious issues this isso-called perodontal disease andperodontal disease is associated withall sorts of really bad stuff includingAlzheimer's okay this is not just someWellness culture woo science leap toalzheimer's there's literally evidencethat the specific bacterias that causerecession of the gums can cross theblood brain barrier if they make it intothe general circulation and potentiallycause Plax and Tangles some of theHallmark features of neural degenerationin Alzheimer's okay probably not theonly cause of Alzheimers but potentiallyone of the major causes this is a newTheory but it's one that a lot of peopleare starting to pay attention to andit's also very clear that bacteria makeit down into these deeper recesses nearthe roots and into the bone that you canend up with issues related to cardiachealth and certainly metabolic Healthokay so again the goal today is not toscare you it's not to spend too muchtime um on all the terrible things thatcan happen but rather to emphasize thepositive which is that if you do theright things at the right timesespecially if you do them on a regularbasis that you can really improve thehealth of your total oral cavity andyour teeth and your breath and all theother stuff that people care about forAesthetics and interpersonalinteractions will flourish as well I'dlike to take a brief moment and thank"

            "text": "the major question that people ask whenasking about or thinking about oralhealth as I mentioned before cavitiesare literally holes they'refenestrations as the uh nerds call themnerds like me call them littlefenestrations little holes down into theenamel that if they make it down to theDentin layer of the tooth most likely doneed to be drilled and filled andpresumably build okay but your goal Ithink all of our goal is to try and keepour teeth in a state of remineralizationby keeping the pH that is the relativeacid alkaline balance of the mouth suchthat the saliva supportsremineralization now let's think abouthow a cavity actually forms turns outthat no specific food not even sugarcauses cavities cavities are not causedby sugar cavities are caused by bacteriathat feed on sugar and now that's notjust a little bit of a Twist in themechanism that's a critical pointthere's no specific food not even puresugar not even like a hard candy like adelicious Jolly Rancher I used to likethose when I was a kid they get stuck inyour tooth that causes cavities no it'sthe bacteria that feed on sugar thatthen produce acid that burrows downthrough that degrades that demineralizesthe tooth in this very focal area thatwe call a cavity okay now if that isn'tsurprising enough get this the bacteriathat causes cavities by eating sugar andreleasing this acid while there areseveral of them the major one is calledstreptococus mutans or what I'll callstrep mutans for short strep mutans isnot something you're born with it'sactually acommunicable bacteria that's right yougive it to one another through howsharing of glasses sharing of bottleskissing on the mouth Etc now I am nothere to tell you not not to do any ofthose things I'm certainly not here totell you that however and by the way inresearching this episode I did learnthat there is a specific category ofperson out there typically they are adentist or married to a dentist thathave opted believe it or not to neverkiss their children near or on the mouthso as to help their children not getstreptococus mutans because almost alladults carry it not all but it'scommunicable like a STI or like a flu orlike a it's communicated betweenindividuals we are not born with it nowthat's a whole area of U let's just callitbiosocial ethics decision-making that Ithink most people are not going to betoo concerned with or at least act onbecause let's face it most people arenot going to change their overallbehavior of kissing or usage of bottlesor glasses in order to avoid gettingstrep mutans most people in the worldhave strep mutans or will get strepmutans and it lives in the mouth okay itjust resides there strep mutans is thereand it's hungry what's it hungry forsugar when there's sugar present it eatsit it produces acid the acid producescavities taking teeth from a state ofremineralization to demineralization orand by the way this is really importantif your mouth is already in a statethat's moredemineralization mode so to speak wellthen it will capitalize on that and itwill cause cavities much faster okay sokeep in mind that acidity is bad for themouth does that mean that you shouldnever consume a lemon or and by the wayyes I'm guilty of everyone a while chewa lemon slice or drinking water withlemon in it or carbonated drinks orsodas or tea or anything that has acidicflavor no likewise should you completelyavoid ingesting any kind of sugarbecause strep mutans love sugar no turnsout strep mutans like sugars in the formof complex carbohydrate sugars too so ifyou eat pasta or rice or oatmeal andsome bread every once in a while as I doI'm an omnivore I eat meat and fish andeggs and also starches and vegetablesand fruits I'm an omnivore as mostpeople are well then strep mutans has anopportunity to eat the sugars that comefrom those other carbohydrates does thatmean that if you were to have a zerocarbohydrate diet no sugars no starchesEtc you would reduce the opportunity forstrep mutans to consume sugar andrelease acid maybe maybe however mostpeople won't do that and strep mutans isa very clever maybe even diabolicalbacteria and if you are on a zerocarbohydrate zero sugar diet there'ssome evidence that strep mutans willfigure out ways to feed on othercomponents of food in order to createthis acid to then create cavities inyour teeth so the key thing tounderstand here is that cavities formform not from foods not from sugars perse but from strep mutans and otherbacteria that eat those sugars andcreate acid hence the critical need tokeep your mouth as alkaline as possiblewhich does not mean that you can neverdrink some lemon water or coffee or teahere's the key point that everyone needsto remember because this dovetailsbeautifully into how often you shouldbrush and floss and when you shouldbrush and floss specifically the keypoint is the degree to which your mouthis in a demon state or a remin state andthe degree to which cavities have theopportunity to form is dependent on theamount of time the amount of time inwhich your mouth is net acidic or netalkaline the amount of time that you arein ademineralization mode orremineralization mode okay so it's theamount of time no one no one can avoidhaving their mouth be acidic every oncein a while or ingesting a sugar or afood that strep mut mutans can feed onand produce acid the key is to try andreduce the amount of strep mutans andreduce the amount of acid in the mouththat's the best way to reduce cavitiesand even reverse cavities that havestarted to form now in a moment I'mgoing to tell you about fluoride because"

            "text": "I know there are a lot of questionsabout fluoride but in order for you tounderstand what I say about fluoride andto make the best decision about fluorideboth in drinking water and toothpasteetc for you you have to understand theremineralization process just a littlebit just a little bit so a little bit ofchemistry here a little bit ofstructural biology and this will be funI promise even if you know no biology nostructural biology no chemistry you'regoing to like this part and it's verysimple those minerals that form thecrystals within the enamel and some ofthe deeper layers of your tooth or teethrather those crystals form through aspecific type of bond and those bondsare very strong think of them like Legochains but these are not you know justconventional Lego chains these are Legochains that when they stick when twopieces come together things are tough topull apart they're not indestructiblebut they're tough to pull apart andthey're also special because unlike astring of Legos like a single string ofLegos these bonds that form duringremineralization of the teeth areinterdigitated with one another orrather are at angles with one anotherthat make those bonds especially strongany architect or somebody thatunderstands structural biology willunderstand that bonds can be weak orstrong depending on whether or notthey're linear whether or not they'recrossed whether or not and lates there'sa whole bunch of interesting you knowangled forces stuff that the Architectswill understand and the the constructionworkers will understand at a veryintuitive and and concrete level no punintended and on and on but just thinkabout it a bond is only as strong as thenumber of different points at which itcan resist shearing and pressure so theway that these re remineralization bondsform is through the addition of specificminerals at specific angles and thenaturally occurring mineral mineralthat's responsible for the majority ofthese Bonds in the enamel and teeth iscalled hydroxy appetite what a greatname if you're talking about oral healthright because we use the mouth for a lotof things you can think of the smalllist or long list of those things thereare many of them you know depending onwho you are and what you like to do withyour mouth but the point being that wedo indeed eat with our mouth appetite ispart of eating so you just rememberhydroxy appetite bonds and they are verystrong but they're not indestructibleacid can actually break those bonds okaythat's the mineralization process nowfluoride is a substance that is not avitamin it's not a mineral it is not anessential nutrient but that in the lastcentury it was discovered can actuallyreplace some of the hydroxyapatite bondsin teeth and actually make those bondshyper strong super physiologicallystrong now we'll talk about the safetyconsiderations with fluoride in a littlebit because there are some safetyconsiderations but it was decided inMass in the United States and Europethat the addition of fluoride to thedrinking water and to many toothpastesor tooth powders would be useful becauseit creates these super physiologicallystrong bonds within the minerals of theteeth and indeed it does it doesfluoride gets between those Lego piecesand makes them extra extra strong andthis is why fluoride is added to thedrinking water but and this is veryimportant to emphasize but nowadaysthere's a really polarized debate aboutfluoride because some people out therebelieve that fluoride can disruptthyroid Health might be disruptive forbrain health certainly if fluoridelevels are too high in drinking water orany substance it can be very dangerousit can be a poison but of course thedose makes the poison right fluorideitself may not be poisonous at very lowlevels but there really two camps nowthat have formed and I'll justillustrate those two camps by virtue ofwhat's happening right now right now inthe state of California there is a majorlawsuit against the government becausepeople want fluoride removed from thedrinking water because of the long listof bad things that excessive I want tohighlight excessive fluoride can do forbodily and brain health especially inkids but also in adults at the very sametime meaning right now there is also amajor lawsuit this one in Buffalo NewYork from Mostly parents who are suingthe City of Buffalo saying that therewas not enough maybe even zero fluoridein the drinking water for some period oftime and as a consequence theirchildren's teeth or oral health or bothis depleted and they are suing fordamages okay so there this is a reallypolarized camp now I did a full episodeof The hubman Lab podcast all aboutwater and I talked about fluoride levelswhich levels are thought by the CDC tobe safe which levels are not thought tobe safe I talked about some of thetheories as to how fluoride mightdisrupt function of the thyroid and someconsiderations there please check outthe time stamp in that episode I link tothat time stamp in the caption for thisepisode but the important Point here isthat if you are at all concerned aboutfluoride in the drinking water thesimple answer is to just filter thewater that comes out of the tap ifyou're concerned about fluoride then Isuppose you'd probably want to avoidtoothpastes that have fluoride indeedthere are some I will provide links tosome of those in the show note captionsfor this episode there are a variety ofthese zero fluoride toothpaste that havestarted to accumulate but keep in mindthat when fluoride is introduced intothe bonds of the mineral of the teeththey do make the teeth really reallystrong but and all the dentists I spoketo emphasize this point the bonds thatform are not the natural bonds now thefact that they're not the natural bondsdoesn't necessarily mean that theyaren't good for us or that they're badfor us but the bonds that form whenviewed under what's called electronmicroscopy look different they look wavythey're not smooth bonds and they doincrease the so resistance to differentforces including cavities or acid thatwould create cavities to be specificthey make the teeth strongerstructurally so resistance to chippingEtc but there is a growing concern aboutexcessive fluoride which by the way ifyou drink a lot of tap water you'regoing to be exposed to more fluoridethan if you drink less tap water that'sjust kind of stands to reason but peopledon't really talk about this right whenyou talk about x amount of fluoride byconcentration in a given liter of wateror gallon of water you also have to askwell how much tap water are you drinkingevery day okay you have to ask thatquestion right it's not simply theconcentration it's how much you're Inesoverall and that's something that's muchharder to control for again in the waterepisode I talk about ways to eliminateor reduce fluoride in the drinking waterif that's a concern of yours but if youwant to know why there's fluoride indrinking water it's because government'sfigured out hey well if we want toreduce tooth decay what's the simplestlowcost method to do that well it's toput fluoride in the drinking water andyou now also now know why there'sfluoride in a lot of toothpaste butgiven the concerns about thyroid Healthpotential concerns about brain healthnow you also know why many peopleincluding some dentists that I spoke toare not big fans of fluoride both forchildren and for adults so you just haveto make a decision for you I'm not hereto tell you what to do you just have todecide are you Pro neutral or againstfluoride in you're drinking water and ifso are you going to filter are you goingto completely avoid drinking any watermaybe even cooking with any water fromthe T and on and on but now you know whyfluoride is in drinking water andfluoride is in toothpaste if you'resomebody who's concerned about fluoridein either or both of those sources wellthen what you really want to think aboutand what most of us probably should bethinking about anyway is trying toincrease the remineralization state ofour teeth and mouth in ways that don'tcreate the opportunity for any otherhealth hazard and I will say this aswell which is that there's some data nota lot but some data that fluoride mightnot be so great for our oral microbiomeand as we'll soon learn the oralmicrobiome is critical for our oral andoverall all

avoidingperiodontal disease maybe even forreversing some aspects of tooth andperiodontal sickness because indeed youcan do that if you shift your mouth tothe correct pH if you're putting it intothat remineralization mode okay howeverbefore we get into the todos I thinkit's very important to discuss the doNots that every dentist and periodontistI spoke to agreedon the Quick List as I'll call it of badfor your teeth bad for your mouth andtherefore bad for your brain and bodyare not surprisingly perhaps alcoholwhich by the way I did an entire episodeabout alcohol it's one of our morepopular episodes I'm not here to tellyou to never drink if you're an adultwho's not- alcoholic but the cut offseems to be two alcohol based drinks perweek Beyond which you run into troubleand yes zero is better than any but herewhen we say alcohol is not good for oralhealth and for tooth Health what we'retalking about is the disruption thatalcohol creates to the microbiome andthe way that it Alters the pH of yoursaliva and places the mouth and theteeth into a demineralization statethat's very clear it also kills certaincells of the mouth some people Iremember this in college would say ohyou know if you've got a you know you'vegot a like scratch in the back of yourthroat you're getting sick you know youshould drink and that's what they saidyou should drink it's going to kill thatthing off well guess what it does theexact opposite it kills off a bunch ofthings that you want like the cells inand around the mucosal layer of themouth that are actually going to provideimmune support and eliminate thosebacteria or viruses uh that are makingyou sick Etc so alcohol is bad I'm notsaying you shouldn't drink at all ifyou're a non-alcohol adult you have todecide for you but just understand thatif you're drinking alcohol that you wantto pay extra attention to your oralhealth and your tooth care practicesespecially on the days around thatalcohol consumption and if you'resomebody who doesn't want to drinkalcohol now you have yet another reasonto not drinkalcohol the second thing on the no flylist or the not good for us list forsake of oral health are stimulants nowof course things like methamphetaminewhich are you know severely dilusaddictive drugs for all sorts of reasonsthey kill dopaminergic and other brainneurons they are highly addictive um andon and on but also stimulants likeadderal viance etc those stimulantsbasically any drug that increasesepinephrine and norepinephrine so calledadrenaline and noradrenaline are theother names for those are going to havea negative effect on oral health doesthat mean you should stop thosemedications if you've been prescribedthem no it means that you should do someother things to try and offset thenegative consequence of stimulants whywould stimulants cause such disruptionin oral health well there are really tworeasons there's a chemical reason andthere's a mechanicalreason the chemical reason is thatstimulants change the pH of your salivamaking the mouth more acidic which makesstrep mutans and other bacteria morecapable of creating cavities down intothe teeth they take your mouth and yourteeth from that remineralization stateor I've been referring to it mode tothat demineralization demon mode demonmode that's a way to remember it's baddemon mode demon mode not good maybe ina video game demon mode is good Demonmode not good for the mouth demon modedemineralization mode so there's achemical reason why stimulants disruptthe oral health milu and causedisruption in tooth health anddegradation demon of the enamel of theteeth and deeper layers of the teeth andthis is profoundly evident in methbut the other reason and this was areason that was shared with me by aphysician an MD from University ofCalifornia San Francisco who interactsby virtue of his profession with a lotof Methamphetamineaddicts who have terrible teeth is thatstimulants encourage mouth breathingwatch a meth addict or watch somebodywho's on a high dose of stimulant andthey tend to mouth breathe because ofthe shifts in autonomic nervous systemfunction they tend to be mouth breathersso it's the drying of the mouth thatalso shifts the mouth from thatremineralization mode todemineralization mode so if you do takestimulants by prescription I would hopenot methamphetamine or elicit drugs butif you take prescription stimulants andby the way things like Wellbutrinmodafanil they do qualify as stimulantseven though modaal is a little bit of aspecial case any drug that increasesnorepinephrine epinephrine any stimulantand yes indeed coffee we'll talk aboutcoffee as well and tea will make thesaliva more acidic and make your oralhealth po potentially less good mouthbreathing bad for oral health bad forteeth bad bad bad there's just noquestion about it so today's discussionI'm calling oral health but thatincludes oral Airway health and I'vetalked before on this podcast about thefact that if you can be a nasal breatherbe a nasal breather please as long asyou're not speaking as long as you'renot eating try and breathe through yournose if you're exercising and exercisingreally hard like you're running reallyhard fine mouth breathe I don't thinkthere's any evidence that staying innasal breathing mode all the time whileexercising is best for performance infact to the contrary there are timeswhen you need to mouth breathe andthere's Sports where you need to Exhalethrough the mouth specifically certainmartial arts for instance so not sayingdon't ever breathe through your mouthbut as much as possible try and keep theoral cavity moist and closed okay thisis critical so stimulants dry out themouth they increase the acidity of thesaliva that's bad smoking cigarettes andyes also cannabis and yes vaping doesthis too it's so funny anytime I talkabout smoking being bad people like wellwhat about cannabis well I didn'tepisode about cannabis cannabis doeshave certain medical uses that are veryinteresting and um there's good evidencefor those but for many people cannabisis not a good idea you can check outthat episode to decide for you thenpeople ask what about vaping vaping isnot as bad as smoking right that's whatthey say where they're sort of askingsaying hoping wishing fantasizing andthe truth is that vaping is terrible foryour oral health as well is it as bad assmoking probably not but it's bad for abunch of other reasons that offset anygain or gains you would get from vapinginstead of smoking so just know that ifyou're a smoker or a vapor or if youvape rather that you're going to want topay extra attention to some of the otherprotocols discussed and that we willdiscuss going forward in order to tryand support your oral and therefore yourwhole body Health Okay so we've gotalcohol stimulant smoking SL vaping andby extension dipping tobacco frankly notgood for oral health or tooth Health infact they can be proc cancerous to thegum tissue it's well established andthey can also cause degradation of thegum tissue and even some of theunderlying bone if you tend to do it onthe same side all the time or often atall so that's not good we alreadydiscussed that sugar is not good fororal health does that mean you can neveringest sugar no of course not enjoy thesweets you enjoy every once in a whileenjoy a nice pastry um you know do asyou will um if you're somebody who nevereats those things great but thenunderstand that any carbohydrate anystarch provides a sugar that strepmutans can eat and create acid anddemineralize your teeth create cavitiesthat is so avoid sugar in excess and ifyou eat sugar try and rinse your mouthafter and ideally you would brush maybeeven floss after okay I do know thosepeople that after every meal they runeven in the middle of the day they runto the bathroom and brush their teethand floss and that's great but mostpeople don't do that so swishing waterrinsing your mouth out again plain watermaybe with a little bit of salt in it isgoing to be beneficial we'll talk aboutmouthwash es later just to give you alittle window into where we're headedwith that mostmouthwashes terrible terrible for youroral health especially alcohol-based orantiseptic based mouthwashes exceptunder certain conditions prescribed orotherwise okay so if you eat any sugarand frankly after you eat anything it'sa good idea to try and clear as much ofthat food product from your mouth youmay not think you still have food inyour mouth and teeth but trying to youknow swish some water maybe spit it outmaybe swallow it that's up to you areyou a spit or swallow not my businessdon't want to don't tell me don't put itin the comments just decide foryou but sugar and other food productsresiding in the mouth for long periodsof time not good and similarly acidityfoods that are acidic so certain thingslike citrus fruits which I love I loveoranges I have an orange tree in mybackyard now and I absolutely love it Ilove oranges grapefruit I just I lovethe peel I even eat the peel sometimesit's sodelicious and no one's telling you notto eat acidic Foods or to avoid aticdrinks like lemon water or carbonatedlemon water some people are reallyextreme and they decide to just use astraw when they drink those things infact the dentist I spoke to said yescould you ask people please if they'regoing to drink acidic drinks to try anduse a straw but then I said well youknow a lot of straws they disrupt theenvironment most people aren't carryingaround metal straws or you know and whatabout the turtles this kind of thing andthey said well okay here's the realtruth the real truth is it's the amountof time that the mouth is exposed tothat acid so if they're going to drinkit drink it over the course of 10 15maybe 20 30 minutes and then be donewith it rinse out the mouth with alittle bit of water and try and clearout that acidity it's not aboutcompletely avoiding acid foods or sugaryFoods or acidic drinks it's about againlimiting the amount of time that theoverall milu of the mouth is acidicbecause of this whole demon remen thingstrep mutans and the acid created bystrep mutans that can derode the teethand the fact that if your mouth is keptacidic for long periods of time you'regoing to provide the opportunity forfaster and deeper development of thosecavities and keep this in mind againanytime we talk about demineralizationthe formation of cavities remember it'slike a seesaw it's either demon or remanbut not both so anytime you'redemineralizing your teeth you're alsonot remineralizing your teeth okay soreally avoid alcohol stimulants smokingvaping sugar mouth breathing acidicFoods acidic drinks but many of us mostof us can't avoid any sugars any acidicFoods the other things can be avoidedbut some of us are prescribed thesedrugs and need these drugs some peoplelike a drink with alcohol in it everyonce in a while and it's perfectly finefor them or they've deemed it perfectlyfine for them in that case try and rinsethe mouth try and keep the milu of themouth as moist and as basic or alkalinerather less acidic as possible so totranslate this a bit more to the real"

            "text": "world if you're somebody like me wholoves tea I drink cold brew zero sugar ybate that's my favorite source ofcaffeine I also like a nice black doubleespresso or coffee every once in a whileit's fine to drink that but you don'twant to sip on those sorts of things allday and you don't want to sip on themfor hours and hours and if you're goingto combine those things with some acidicFoods or with any kind of food you knowtry and get your meals done wrap them upand rinse your mouth and move to thenext part of your day and that actuallySegways into a really important pointthat came about when researching thisepisode that if I had to highlight boldface underline and light up oneparticular protocol that I think mosteverybody is not thinking about is thatthere are certain times in the 24-hourcircadian period in which your mouthmakes the maximum amount ofsaliva okay and that the saliva has anopportunity to be the optimal pH that ischemistry for encouragingremineralization of your teeth andthat's during the daytime and especiallythrough the middle of the day now thereare a couple things that can disruptthat for instance eating anything Idon't care if you're carnivore or veganwhatever omnivore when you eat youchange the pH of your saliva and you'reintroducing those sugars that thebacteria can feed on so one thing thatbecame very clear to me when researchingthis episode talking to experts readingmanuscripts and also reading some reallyinteresting books aboutremineralization opportunities for theteeth is that having a stretch of timeof maybe two four six hours or morewhere you're not eating anything oringesting anything that's acidic interms of liquids can be very beneficialnow this is a vote in support ofso-called intermittent fasting this issomething that I practice typically byeating my first meal somewhere around11:00 a.m. every morning sometimesearlier sometimes have a littlebreakfast at 9:00 if I particularlyhungry but typically I eat my first mealaround 11:00 a.m. or noon and then I eatmy last bite of food by about 8:00 p.m.not Everyone likes to do intermittentfasting and I realize for sake of weightloss it's probably interchangeable withcaloric restriction generally andthere's a lot of debate as to whether ornot intermittent fasting is going toextend lifespan whether or not it'sbetter for metabolic Health than simplecaloric restriction I don't want to getinto that debate frankly it's a barbedwire debate that's been carried out onthis podcast and elsewhere before and Ithink this is ongoing I think it's thethe best way to couch that debate but inresearching this episode it became veryclear that we have an amazingopportunity during the day especially inthe morning and throughout the day tocreate a lot of saliva that's the rightpH to support remineralization of theteeth provided that there isn't a lot offood or acidic liquids in the mouth atthat time so at least to my mind this isan interesting opportunity to placeintermittent fasting which again or evenjust gaps between meals not constantlysnacking or sipping on acidic beveragesthroughout the day as an opportunity tocreate that healthy milu during whichthe teeth can remineralize and theoverall oral health can improvenow does that mean you should never eator drink anything during the middle ofthe day no I'm not saying that I'msaying that if you're going to do thosethings try and clear them from yourmouth as I describedbefore now many of you will probably sayhey during the middle of the night I'mnot eating or drinking anything for someof you that might be the only time thatyou're not eating or drinking anythingbecause you're asleep one would hopeyou'reasleep but here's the interesting thingevery cell tissue and organ in our bodyis on a 24-hour circadian clock I thinkmany of you have heard heard me say thatin the context of viewing morningsunlight and other protocols that I youknow suggest on the huberman loudpodcast but here's the interesting andimportant point in the middle of thenight indeed you're not ingesting anyfood or fluids presumably but yoursaliva production is dramaticallyreduced again dramatically reduced andas a consequence if there's food orrather food opportunity for strep mutansand other bacteria to feed on and createa to erode your teeth the salivanecessary to offset that to combat thatis simply not present or at least notpresent at the same levels that it isduring the day so this is a sort oftwo-prong protocol on the one hand I'msaying you might consider trying tointroduce maybe an hour or two hour orlonger stretches during the day in whichyou're not ingesting any food and ifyou're drinking anything it's not acidicor if you are to try and rinse away thatacid as much as possible so PL waterwould be great avoiding carbonated lemonwater would be great but if you likethose things and indeed I love thosethings I love carbonated lemon water Ilove things like yamat indeed the yate Ilike is cobw zero sugar but has somelemon and ginger in it okay that'sfairly acidic but then drinking it downeither pretty quickly or if you're goingto sip on it then rinsing it away withsome water and not doing that throughoutthe entire day and indeed I tend todrink my caffeine early in the day andnot so much throughout the day maybe alittle bit of mate in the afternoonsometimes okay so that's one aspect ofmaintaining or encouraging the correctpH of saliva to remineralize your teethright create these windows ofopportunity where there's a lot ofsaliva for long stretches of time duringthe day as long as possible while stillmaking it compatible with your nutritionneeds and your hydration needs of coursethe other prong or the other aspect ofthis protocol is that at night when yougo to sleep you need to know you're notproducing very much saliva and that'sthe critical time to make sure thatthere is as little opportunity ispossible for strep mutans and otherbacteria to feed on sugars or other foodproducts and thereby to create acid thatcreates cavities and so this is a veryimportant protocol that every singledental and oral health care professionalI spoke to supported and indeedChampions which is if there is a mostcritical time of day or night to brushyour teeth and floss and clean yourteeth it's at nighttime it's atnighttime why am I saying this with suchwhispered importance well I think thereare many people out there in particularpeople that fall into that secondcategory that I mentioned at thebeginning of today's episode that wakeup in the morning and brush their teethmaybe even usemouthwash maybe floss and do a bunch ofthings to try and get their mouth cleanand fresh especially if they're going tointeract with other people during theday and to get rid of all the kind ofstickiness and you know mouth you knowmorning breath that kind of thing butthat at night they're finishing dinnermaybe having some dessert doing somework and passing out without brushingtheir teeth or flossing or simplygetting too lazy to brush or floss andby the way I'm going to raise my handand just say for many years I was inthat category I know ew gross but I wasin that category I had high motivationto brush in floss or at least a brush inthe morning very little motivation to doit in the evening every professionalsaid if you're going to brush and flossjust once per 24 hours and that is notwhat they recommend by the way but ifyou were going to do it just once thecritical time the most essential time tobrush and floss and clean the mouth andget the millu of the mouth correct fortooth care and mouth overall oral healthis at night before you go to sleepbecause you already know the mechanisticbackbone for this argument because atnight you're producing far less salivaand if there's any food product therethat the bacteria can feed on the salivaisn't there to combat that because it'sa constant battle between acidity andalkalinity your saliva is coming intrying to save everything and the strepmutans is trying to destroy your teethand the acid is the Weaponry they useand what fuels that Weaponry whatprovides them more ammo to destroy yourteeth are sugars and acidity so if youwere going to brush your floss andideally you do both only once per 24hours it would be at night before goingto sleep indeed so much so that I wouldsay that nighttime brushing and flossingis perhaps one of the most importantthings that we could do for overall oralhealth care we'll talk about what to dowhat to use for brushing and flossing ina few minutes but that's absolutelyessential I do not want that to betranslated into you only need to brushor brush and floss once per 24 hoursevery professional I spoke to and all ofthe data point to the fact that doing ittwice per 24 hours is best or perhapseven three times per 24 hours but let'sbe honest most people are not going tobrush and floss three times every 24hours some will but most won't and nowof course I've been saying

            "text": "flossing but I haven't talked about theincredibly extensive landscape of how tobrush and floss so now let's takeourselves back to being little kidsright when we were taught to brush ourteeth in a particular way you knowyou're supposed to spend a certainnumber of minutes set a timer supposedto floss in a certain way every time wego to the dentist they tell us to flossin a certain way do this not this whatdo the data really say what are themodern health professionals in dentaland oral health really suggest in we dowhen it comes to brushing and flossingand fortunately here there's a nearuniform consensus there's always thatoutlier that person that says to dothings a little bit differently or nothere's in fact one person veryprominent in the dental health spacethat is not a fan of flossing but theyare really the outlier the vast majorityof dentists out there all say the samething you need to brush you need tofloss you need to do it twice a day ormore and you need to do it correctly sonow let's talk about what Cor correctbrushing and flossing really is okay soI'm not going to demonstrate how tobrush your teeth but one very actionableprotocol that was told to me by all thedental professionals I spoke to was usea soft toothbrush now this one hurts orI suppose hurts less anyway it hurts myheart a little bit because I enjoy verymuch using a medium or hard toothbrushand really like scrubbing back thereespecially in the teeth in the back itjust feels good I feel like I'm doingsomething good I get into the backs ofthe teeth the fronts of the teeth I knowI actually enjoy brushing my teethespecially lately don't ask me why but Ido but every single one of them saidthat that very vigorous brushing withmedium or hard as they're calledbristles really disrupts the interfacebetween the teeth and the gums in waysThat's not healthy for the gums andactually makes tenting of the gums andthose Pockets those recesses as they'recalled far more likely to form and everysingle one of them said if you areregular with your brushing andespecially if you're brushing andflossing regularly that a softtoothbrush that is one that's moved in acircular motion on the fronts and backsof your teeth for all your teeth andthat is gentle you're not providing alot of pressure is going to be the bestway to break up that bofilm layer eachand every time and promote the besttooth and overall oral health so Isuppose um manufacturers who are makingmedium and hard toothbrushes maybe giveus some w rationale for that um you knowbecause the dental professionals that Ispoke to and again I spoke to a fairnumber of them all said the same thingsoft toothbrush Notch just better softtoothbrush best likewise if you use anelectric toothbrush which I now dosometimes I switch back and forth but ifyou use an electric toothbrush it wasrecommended that you not provide toomuch pressure that you really try andkeep the tips of the bristles on the theteeth and gums and yes it was alsosuggested that people brush their gumsthis is interesting for people out therewho have tooth sensitivity one of themajor suggestions from people in thedental and perodontal field at least theones I spoke to was to actually brushyour gums lightly to increasecirculation of blood and other nutrientsto the deeper portions of the tooth thatactually extend into the bone now thereis a tremendous amount of blood flow tothe gums anyone who's um you know sortof nicked their uh gum with a whilewhile flossing or with a toothpick cantell you bleeds very readily and that'snot a good thing right you don't want tocreate bleeding of the gums we'll talkabout bleeding of the gums duringflossing in a moment by the way so don'tjump the gun just yet I said jump thegun not jump the gum by the way if youare brushing your gums make sure you'reusing a soft toothbrush if you're usingelectric toothbrush make sure you'regoing very lightly on the gums andbecause there's so much blood flow tothe gums it does encourage a lot ofcirculation to some of the deepercavities of the tooth as it turns out Idon't want to reverse to tooth anatomyin any kind of detailed way now but ofcourse within the tooth you have againenamel you have the Dentin you've gotWhat's called the the pulp or the centerthere's a lot of nerves inating thecenter of the tooth there's a bunch ofother tissues and and the bone around itand layers Etc and when you massage orlightly brush the gums around thereyou're encouraging a lot of blood flowto those deeper components of the toothwhich are really the live and activecomponents of the tooth that requireblood flow and nutrients so this is agood thing in fact it's probably such agood thing that most people perhaps allof us should do it but most peopleprobably won't take the time to alsobrush their gums but if you have alittle bit of time it can be beneficialespecially if you have sensitive teeththe idea that's of emerging now in thedental field is that it can help promoteresilience or less sensitivity of theteeth to things like hot and cold andmaybe even to pressure so before we talkabout flossing I just want to"

            "text": "changing the chemistry of your mouth notjust immediately after meals or duringbrushing or flossing but really aroundthe clock and one of the key protocolsthat I'd like to discuss is the use ofan artificial sugar called Xylitolxylitol is a very low calorie sweetenerI can place it among the other lowcalorie sweeteners like aspartamesucrose Stevia Etc but what's uniqueabout xylitol is that very much likestandard sugar or any kind ofcarbohydratesugar the bacteria streptococus mutansloves to eat Xylitol but whenstreptococus mutans eats Xylitol itdoesn't meaning it cannot produce theacid that normally would demineralizethe teeth and create cavities inaddition to that when streptococusmutans eats Xylitol it killsstreptococus mutans so what this meansis that if xylol is present in the oralcavity after a meal say in the minutesand hours after a meal then any strepmutans that happens to be there is goingto preferentially feed on the Xylitolnot other sugars and it won't be able torelease acid and because Xylitol canactually inhibit the growth and that isthe proliferation of more strep mutanswe've got a twofer we've got a situationwhere strep mutans can't release acid todemineralize the teeth and potentiallycause cavities and the total amount ofstrep mutans that can grow that canproliferate in what are called coloniesliterally the bacteria colonizes on theteeth in that forming that bofilm wellthen that can't happen so xylitol is avery potent tool for improving oralhealth in this way in addition Xylitolreduces inflammation of the gum tissueand other soft tissues of the mouth andso xylitol is providing an array ofpositive benefits especially when it'spresent to the mouth immediately aftermeals and for that reason there are anumber of different dentists that havecreated Xylitol productsin the form of gums or in the form ofmints specifically to be used aftermeals so by chewing a few of theseXylitol mints or by chewing a Xylitolbased gum immediately after a mealyou're taking substantial steps towardsimproving the chemical milu of yourmouth and inhibiting the proliferationof cavity forming streptococus mutantsnow you can also find some literature onother proposed benefits of Xylitol suchas you know improving overallmicrobiome uh such as reducinginflammation in other tissues besidesthe gums and within the mouth there issome evidence that it can support thegut microbiome because of course theoral microbiome and the gut microbiomeare contiguous they have differentcompartments I mean you might even besurprised to learn that within yourmouth there are different niches asthey're called for instance there'sdifferent microbiota that live on thegums versus the hard pallet versus thesoft pallet back in the throat and thenas you descend into the gut Etc and itdoes appear that Xylitol has certainpositive benefits for all of thosedifferent gut microbiome niches but theliterature on that is less wellsubstantiated than for instance theliterature showing that if xylitol isput in as a surrogate sugar substratefor strep mutans that it disables strepmutans and can prevent the formation ofcavities now as far as I know whenconsumed in mint form or gum form I'mnot aware of any specific side effectsor bad effects of Xylitol provided thatit's not consumed in excess but as witheverything dosage matters so if you'resomebody who wants to explore the use ofxylol gum or xylol mins after a meal Iwouldn't suggest going from consumingzero Xylitol mins to consuming 50 a dayor something like that or even 10 a dayyou might start off slowly and justconsume one or two after a meal maybejust your morning meal maybe just yourevening meal something of that sortrather than chewing Xylitol gum all daylong etc etc I'll just mention one otherpositive benefit of Xylitol gum which isif you use Xylitol gum after say yournoon meal or your early Day meal itfurther increases the production ofsaliva which as we talked about beforeis a great thing because one of the bestways to support oral health and toothhealth is to have a long stretch of timein the middle of the day where you'reproducing a lot of healthy saliva inlarge amounts because again saliva isthis incredible stuff that's supportingremineralization of the teeth so lotsand lots of reasons to think about maybeconsider using xotl gum or xotl minsthere are a number of different onesavailable out

thegreat answer is yes there are actually anumber of things that you can do withbasic over-the-counter stuff from thegrocery store that all the dentists Ispoke to said yeah that's a pretty goodoption it's not the best optionavailable perhaps but it's a pretty goodoption and in many cases it's betterthan the typical commercially availabletoothpaste or mouthwash forinstance I would imagine based oneverything I now know about thestructure of teeth that using somethinglike baking soda to brush the teethwould indeed scrape off the bofilmperhaps even whiten the teeth a littlebit although as we talked about earlieryou're not really whitening the teethyou're actually just changing the umreflectiveness uh and some of thecomposition of that enamel which istranslucent so that you can see theunderlying components better well Italked to several dentists and they toldme that baking soda actually is fairlylow on the abrasiveness rating scalethey have a specific rating scale forthis that we don't have to go into butit's actually considered quite safe forthe enamel of the teeth especially ifyou're brushing with a soft toothbrushand you're not like really grinding thestuff against your teeth at maximumintensity or even near maximum intensityso it turns out that baking soda andwater is actually a pretty goodtoothpaste if you're not going to go buya toothpaste so that's good news now youmay have heard that you can make a sortof mouth wash or mouth rinse with bakingsoda water and a little bit of hydrogenperoxide I want to emphasize a littlebit but I'm also going to emphasize Idon't think this is a good idea at allwhy is it not a good idea at all wellfirst of all when we were kids we usedto take baking soda and hydrogenperoxide and put them together tosimulate volcanoes so um that tells youright there the kind of chemicalreaction that you're going to get but inaddition to that it's pretty clear thathydrogenperoxide unless there's a specificmedical recommendation to do so is notsomething you want to introduce to theoral cavity now this is something thatI'm very familiar with because when Iwas a postto so this is in the 2005 to2010 stretch I started to get somepretty bad caners saurus I don't knowabout you but krur feel awful to me Ihate them when you eat they hurt whenyou swallow they hurt when do anythingthey pretty much hurt and someone gaveme the recommendation to use a littlebit of baking soda dissolved in somewater and a little bit of hydrogenperoxide to use that as a oral rinse andof course then to spit it out and I didthat and actually what happened to me isI got almost quarter siiz ulcers on theroof of my mouth and on the sides of mymouth it took those little canr saurswhich were annoying and kind of painfuland turn them into full-blown ulcers Iknow this because when I stopped usingit those healed up almost immediatelyand then when I spoke to some dentistsand peridontist they said oh yeah yeahhydrogen peroxide is just far tooabrasive for the mouth cavity and thereason I raised this is because I don'tthink I'm alone in that if you kind ofventure into some of the um let's callit alternative recommendation space fororal health um you may hear that thingslike hydrogen peroxide can be useful forgargling with or swishing with if youare starting to get a little bit of athroat tickle maybe an infection itturns out it's a really bad idea now ifthere are Physicians or oral healthexperts out there that strongly believein the use of hydrogen peroxide rinsesor gargling with it to promote oralhealth for any reason let me know in theshow note captions I don't want to goagainst any of those recommendations butthis now considered kind of old schoolrecommendation of creating one's ownmouthwash with a little bit of bakingsoda some hydrogen peroxide and waterdoes not seem like a good idea not justbased on my experience but every one ofthe dental professionals that I spoke tothat said it does seem that creating ahigh salt solution okay so taking somesalt putting in water dissolving it andthen finding the point at which it won'tquite dissolve because the concentrationof sodium is just high enough and usingthat as of course not something toswallow but rather as a dental rinse soputting your mouth and swishing itaround and then spitting it out and it'sgoing to taste very salty and thentaking a swig of water you know justplain water and then swishing it aroundand then spitting it out that actuallyprovides a really nice milu for theprodu production of healthy mouthbacteria it's near zero cost suppose youneed a little bit of salt low water anda glass to put it in but it's basicallyzero cost and if you think about it thathigh saline or high salinity solution isa lot like the sort of brins and theliquid that comes from these low sugarProbiotic foods that earlier I wassuggesting and in other episodes I'vesuggested could be really healthy forswallowing for the gut microbiota butagain I want to be very clear do not donot swallow highsalt concentration fluid we're talkingabout a Swish and then a spitting it outas a way to improve the overall milu ofthe mouth to get the pH right to promotethe proliferation of healthy microbiotacomponents Okay so we've talked aboutsome commercially available gums andmints containing Xylitol we've talkedabout some commercially availabletoothpastes indeed some toothpaste thatyou know almost fall into the veryBoutique category because they have allthese things that are known by dentistsand uh peridontist to be great for oralhealth but those can run some cost rightand so I do think it's important that wealso talked about the use of just bakingsoda with a soft toothbrush and somewater and gently brushing the teeth as agreat way to disrupt the bofilm andclean your teeth and a high saltsolution as a Swish and spit followed byyou know uh Swish and spit with clearwater clean water no salt in it as aEssenvery low cost or zeroc cost mouthwashFar and Away different from the heavilyscented alcohol-based antiseptic mouthwashes that are commercially availableand that we know are basically not goodfor our oral microbiome in addition I'dlike to

you want to maintain andbuild up your tooth and oral health butit's very clear that if the cavities getdown into the denting layers of thetooth that in most cases there is noremaining opportunity to remineralizethe teeth you using the sorts ofpractices we're talking about today andthat indeed it's very likely that thosecavities need to be drilled and filledokay now that's not always the case andthis is one reason why I highlyrecommend that if you've listened tothis episode and if you're here at thispoint in the episode and you've listenedto the episode that you talk to yourdentist ask them if they say you have acavity how deep are these cavities doyou think there's an opportunity for meto remineralize the teeth if I do thefollowing things and if they tell youlook you have a cavity or cavities andthey're simply too deep into the tooththat you can't remineralize your teethand fill those in well then you know youshould trust them they're the dentalprofessional if you don't you shouldfind a different dentist however theymay be surprised and who knowspleasantly surprised for you to uh sayHey you know I heard that you canactually remineralize teeth and if I'vegot a cavity but it's still not throughthe enamel layer you know if I'm reallydiligent and you know use some zotol andmaybe some hydroxy appetite and avoidcertain things and do certain thingsdiscussed in this episode that I couldreuh remineralize and fill in thosecavities that said there of course willbe situations where you need to getthose cavities drilled and filledespecially if they make it into the deepdeep layers of the tooth and you do notwant those cavities to persist and forbacteria to proliferate in those deeperlayers of the teeth and down into thebone that is oh so bad for reasons wetalked about earlier not just for yourmouth and your teeth but for yourGeneral Health and brain health includedso for that reason and also because youknow the history of Dentistry was suchthat you know in the early part of thelast century if you had a toothache in acavity what did they do they pulled theteeth they extracted the teeth then atsome point this business of fillingteeth became industry standard so peoplewould get metal fillings now the typesof metal fillings that people had andhave depend on when they got thosefillings there were were believe it ornot lead fillings this is not good youdon't want lead in your body for allsorts of reasons it is terrible forbrain health that's why it's now illegalto contain in paints and many householdgoods you don't want lead fillings butsome people had lead fillings or silverfillings or a combination of lead silverand other things and many metal fillingsthat were given and sometimes are stillgiven depending on where you live in theworld and Country and the kind of HealthCare and costs that you have availableto you contain mercury now I askedseveral dentists about this and saidwell if somebody has a metal fillingthat likely has mercury in it do theyneed to have that metal filling removedand all of the dentists I spoke to saidit depends but generally the practice isto leave those fillings in and try notto disrupt them now they also provided aimportant recommendation which is if youhave metal fillings that contain mercuryor that you think might contain mercuryto avoid disrupting those fillingsthrough the use of things like MasticGum we haven't talked too much aboutmastic gum um I've used mastic gumbefore not for long periods of time it'sa very thick gum uh you know theoriginal use of mastic gum and the thekind of origins of Mastic Gum are like atreap kind of substance that you chew onsupposed to strengthen your jaw Etc um Idon't use it any longer I use it for ashort while doesn't taste like much ofanything some people believe there arecertain anti-inflammatory and otherhealth benefits of Mastic Gum I haven'treally explored mastic gum in enoughdepth or detail to comment on any ofthat but a number of dentists said wellif you have metal fillings chewing onthe like Mastic Gum or you know hardcandies where you're really chewing onon that hard candy which by the wayyou're supposed to suck the hard candythe Jolly ranch you're not supposed tochew on them but that some people willdo that they'll just naturally chew onthose can actually disrupt and liberatesome of that mercury and that would bebad and keep in mind also that whenMercury is contained in a metal fillingit's not really bioactive in that modebut if it's liberated then it can getinto the bloodstream and potentiallycause other issues so this is a somewhatcontroversial topic so much so that incertain countries and I believe in theEU somebody checked me on this but Ibelieve that in the not too distantfuture metal fillings will no longer beused in the European Union perhapselsewhere in the world they're sometimesstill used in the United States there'sa lot that's changing in this landscapearound fluoride around metal fillingsEtc so it's very Dynamic landscape rightnow I think suffice to say that if youhave metal fillings currently try not todisrupt them in a way that couldliberate that mercury however if youhave them and you're really concernedabout them talk to your dentist ask whatthe various options are see whether ornot they could be replaced withsomething safer and if the process forreplacing them is really worth thetrouble and again to just go back to thelarger point of whether or not youshould get cavities filled whether ornot you need that root canal that was avery common question a lot of peoplesaid do we really need root canals do wereally need to drill cavities you knowmy observation based on now havingtalked to a number of differentpractitioners in this space who reallypay a lot of attention to the peerreviewed research the old schoolpractices the new practices and whereeverything is headed is that you knowthere are indeed instances where peopleneed root canals there are many cavitiesthat are just too deep into the teeththat remineralization of the teeththrough the sorts of protocols thatwe're talking about today is not goingto cut it that they really need to bedrilled and filled and of course we hopethose dentists are doing that as littleas is required to maintain dental healthI also would hope that dentists aretalking to their patients about waysthat they can improve their oral healthand indeed there are a lot of casesreported online where people will go inget X-rays and an exam they'll talkabout all these cavities that they haveand then they go home and they do abunch of practices and they are able toremineralize their teeth and toessentially reverse those cavities and Icertainly don't doubt those stories butit's simply not always the case that wecan remineralize our teeth and fill backin our cavities if those cavity recessesare too deep into the teeth they need tobe drilled and filled now that raises afinal set of questions and points which"

            "text": "is do we really need to go to thedentist twice a year every six monthsthat's the general recommendation andthis was a tricky one to ask dentistsbecause of course dentists are highlyincentivized to see their patients andI'm not somebody that believes thateverything is a you know is an attemptto make money but look when money isinvolved things can get complicated nowwhat was really great is that thefeedback I got from dentists was verybalanced I mean I must say that thecommunity of dentists um seems like areally wonderful Community I don't knowhow they treat each other but they werevery kind very generous with informationwith me and at the end of this episodejust before wrapping I'll refer you to acouple um online oral health and dentistEducators that I think are providingsome really useful content on aconsistent basis and I'll provide linksto those in the show note captions buthere's what the consensus was thisbusiness of going to the dentist twice ayear makes sense it makes sense from theperspective of quote unquote routinecleanings but everyone acknowledged thatthose routine cleanings while they canremove tarar that's built up that wouldbe very very difficult for people toreverse or eliminate at home and whilethey can identify cavities and tell youhow far a cavity has developed into thetooth Etc every one of those dentistsagreed that those routine cleanings arenot actually going to help remineralizeyour teeth except to the extent thatthey remove existing bacteria plaque andtartar and so all of them said that theywish for and that they really strive intheir own practices to promote more oralhealth daily Protocols of the sort thatwe've talked about today which I thinkis just great I think obviously Ibelieve in medical professionalsproviding routine care I also believe ineach and all of us doing things for ourhealth not just oral health but sleepHealth mental health physical health Etcto try and not just maintain but reallybolster our brain and body againstdisease and also to bolster our Vitalityto feel really great energetic focusedsleeping better Etc so it was refreshingto hear that they feel that way as welland in addition to that all the dentistI spoke to said that you know settingaside situations of likereconstructive uh surgery for the mouthor perodontal surgery which often isneeded if that those recesses into thegums and gingivitis and and worse havestarted to really develop andproliferate all of them emphasize thatthe twice a year Dental visit is notjust about getting the cleaning it'sreally the checkup to evaluate how thosedaily practices are emerging so it'ssort of like going to the doctor for acheck up on your BMI on your bloodpressure but also things like bloodtests things that typically we don't doat home unless we're accessing thosethrough um particular sources but all ofthem emphasize that going to the dentisttwice a year is not just about thosecleanings it's also about establishingwhat the Baseline level of health is inone's mouth and teeth and having that onrecord and in a very detailed way sothat one can check back routinely twicea year and discover whether or not infact they could get away with perhapsone cleaning a year because you're sodiligent about your brushing flossingXylitol uh not being a mouth breatherand on and on or perhaps if you're notbeing very good about those protocols orand this is important if you have someof the genetic variants that create anover proliferation of certain bacteriathat predispose you to gingivitis orthat predispose you to excessive buildupof tartar this is the reality that somepeople have genetic variations thatcreate a susceptibility to certainthings both bacteria and otherconditions in the mouth that make itsuch that those people perhaps need togo to the dentist not just twice a yearbut perhaps four times a year or sixtimes a year indeed there are someindividuals for whom either because oflack of diligence to protocol and orgenetic issues actually need to go tothe dentist every single month for majorcleanings but fortunately if we arediligent about these daily protocolsnighttime protocols and we really areare paying attention to the componentsthat can create healthy saliva andremineralize the teeth and that can fillin any cavities that begin to form andwe're staving off the production ofmutants and we're scraping away thatbofilm on a regular basis that we aregoing to prevent the need for so manyroutine cleanings and even if we arestill getting those two-year routinecleanings you know for those out therethat are fortunate enough to have thatcovered by insurance or can afford itwell then all the better because as Imentioned at the beginning of today'sepisode oral health is not just abouthaving clean straight white teeth andfresh breath it's not just about thatall of those things are great to havebut oral health is about all of that andit's also about reducing cardiovasculardisease it's about reducing irritablebowel syndrome yes I know that wehaven't done an episode about this yetbut I get oh so many requests to doepisodes about irritable bowel syndromeand other colitis type uh you knowboweling gut issues that people have andit's so clear that oral health andpromoting oral health has been linked topromoting positive gut health as wellmaybe even reducing and possiblyeliminating some of the symptoms ofirritable bowel disease because againthe mouth and the gut are contiguouswith one another they're related and alot of the bacteria that can causethings like gut issues are making theirway into the body not directly throughthe gut but through the oral cavitybecause of the richness of blood flow tothat region so again today we've talkedabout a lot of different protocols"
