            "text": "And the question\nspecifically is,why is it that we get more colds\nand flus in the winter months?Is it the temperature outside?Is it the fact that people are\nspending more time indoors?Or is it a myth that we get more\ncolds and flus in the wintermonths?Well, the first thing is that\nthe research very clearlyshows that in winter\nmonths there is a greaterprevalence of colds and flus.Now, of course, the words,\n\"in the winter months\"means many things.For instance, in most areas\nof the world unless youlive directly near the\nequator, in the wintermonths means that days\nare going to be shorterand nights are longer\nthan in the summer months.In general, that's true.It's of course,\nespecially true if youlive very far from the equator.So imagine somebody living up\nin Troms\u00f8, Norway, which isvery close to the North Pole.In winter, days are very,\nvery short in Troms\u00f8.And conversely in\nthe summer months,days are very, very\nlong in Troms\u00f8 Norway.Now, Troms\u00f8 Norway represents an\nextreme of day length variationaccording to time of year.The closer you get\nto the equator,the less variation there is in\nday length and therefore nightlength across the year.However, in most\nlocations on Earth,days will be significantly\nshorter by about an hour or twoat least for certain\nparts of the year.And in general,\nshorter days correlatewith colder temperatures.That's what's really\nimportant to know,which is that shorter days\ngenerally correlate with coldertemperatures regardless of where\nyou live on the planet Earth.OK.So in the winter months\nas we're calling it,involves at least two things,\nshorter days, which means what?It means less sunlight\nand either more artificiallight or more darkness depending\non how much artificial lightyou rely on.It also means, as we\nmentioned, colder temperatures.Colder temperatures, of\ncourse, doesn't necessarilymean that you are exposed\nto those colder temperaturesbecause what's the third thing?Shorter days and\ncolder temperaturesoutside mean that people are\nspending more time indoors.So what the research\nclearly showsis that one of the reasons,\nnot the only, but oneof the reasons for the greater\nprevalence of colds and flusin the short days a.k.a.winter months of the\nyear is that peopleare spending more time\nindoors and thereforeat closer proximity, which\nraises a whole bunch of reallyinteresting questions\nthat have been exploredin the peer reviewed research\nabout proximity cold and flutransmission.There have been\nstudies for instancewhere people come into the\nlaboratory who are sufferingfrom cold and flu and are\nsneezing, having them sneezeat different proximity\nto other people,obviously people are\ndoing this under consent.They're agreeing\nto participate inthese particular experiments.And there does seem to be\na very nice relationshipbetween physical\ndistance between you,the uninfected person,\nand the sneezing,coughing, nose\nwiping, eye wiping,we'll get into why I\nmentioned all of those thingsin a moment, person that\nis suffering from the flu.In other words,\nthe closer you areto somebody who's\nsneezing or coughing,the higher probability that you\nwill contract that cold or flu.OK.So we've already\nestablished two things.First of all, physical\nproximity is a key variablein terms of transmission\nof cold and flu.And at some level that's a duh.I mean, if you think about\nit, if you're in the next roomor down the hallway from\nor across the streetfrom somebody with\na cold or flu,you don't expect to contract\nthat cold or flu from them.Whereas if you're\nin the same vehiclewith them or you're sitting\nnext to them on an airplaneor you are on the same bus or\nin the same classroom as themand they are sneezing\nand coughing,well, then, the probability that\nyou would get that cold or flufrom them is increased.That's just obvious.But the studies that have\nexplored the relationshipbetween physical proximity and\ntransmission of cold and fluhave actually analyzed things\ndown to the range of well,if you're standing\none foot apartor you're standing three\nfeet apart or six feet apart,what's the probability that you\nwill contract that cold or flu?And it follows a very\ndirect relationshipwhere the closer the\nproximity, the more likelythat you're going\nto contract the coldor flu from that person.And of course, anything like\nexchange of skin contactor exchange of saliva\nbecause obviously in casesof romantic relationships\nwhere people will kissor in familial relationships or\nfriendships where people hug,any contact also further\nincreases the transmissionof cold and flu.Not just from stuff emitted\nfrom the nasal passagesand from the mouth when\npeople sneeze and cough,but also when people\nwipe their eyes,even when people wipe their\nskin because oftentimes theyhave cold or flu\nvirus on their skin.It doesn't always survive\nterribly long on the skin.But if they wipe their\nface or wipe their noseor are using tissues\nand then don'twash their hands\nthoroughly afterwards,indeed they can transmit\ncold and flu simplythrough handshake.OK.So for all you\nhypochondriacs out there,I'm arming you with a\nlot of useful knowledgethat will justify\nstaying away from peoplewho perhaps have cold and flu.Now, this particular point\nabout proximity and peoplebeing indoors more\nduring the winter months,and that's why there's more\ncold and flu transmission,raises a whole bunch of\ninteresting questions,and, in fact, protocols that I\nplan to cover in a Huberman Labpodcast episode solely\ndevoted to colds and flusand how to avoid\ngetting colds and flus.But one brief mention\nor telegraph of whatI plan to cover\nin that episode isthat if people are telling\nyou that they are sneezingand coughing due to a cold or\nflu but that they are quoteunquote \"not contagious\"\neither because theyare early in the cold or flu\nor late in the cold or fluand they have these theories\nor claims that oh, I'mno longer contagious.Keep in mind that any time\nsomeone is sneezing or coughingthey are in fact contagious.So I'll get back to\nthat in that full lengthepisode about colds and flus.But I felt it was\ntoo important notto mention right now that\npeople's theories about whenthey are quote\nunquote \"contagious\"or \"not contagious\" are\nrarely substantiatedby the actual data.The actual data\npoint to the factthat when people are\nsneezing and coughing,if it's due to a cold or flu,\nthey are still contagious.OK.So we've established that\ncold outside means people tendto be indoors more\nwhich increasesphysical proximity, which\nis one of the reasonswhy there's more cold\nand flu transmission.One of the other reasons\nwhy being indoors moretends to increase cold\nand flu transmissionis that in the cold months of\nwinter when people are indoors,they tend to be not\nunder air conditioning,not at neutral temperatures,\nbut rather theytend to be in heated rooms.And depending on\nthe type of heatingthat's used, but in general,\ndue to all forms of heating,the heated air tends\nto be drier air.Now, this is a little\nbit counterintuitivebecause if you ever go outside\non a really cold winter day,you will realize\nthat the cold weatheroutdoors is extremely dry.You can almost quote unquote\n\"feel the dryness of the air.\"And if you can't quote unquote\n\"feel the dryness of the air\"or imagine what that's\nlike just imagine this,think of yourself outdoors\non a very cold winterday taking a brisk walk.Then think about yourself\ntaking that same brisk walkon a very humid summer day.Humidity is, of course,\nthe concentrationof water in the ambient\nenvironment, the air,whereas the dryness is\nthe lack of humidity.And just that little simple\nGedankenNet or thoughtexperiment will\nremind you just howdry the cold air is out of\ndoors during the winter months.Whereas indoors we're\nheating that airand indeed the heating\nof that air doeshave the property of drying\nthe nasal and oral passagesbut especially the\nnasal passages.So another key\nreason why there'smore transmission of colds\nand flus in the winter monthsis because people are\nspending more time indoors.And oftentimes the way\nthose indoor environmentsare being heated is drying\nout the nasal passages.And the nasal passages\nrepresent a primary siteof defense for viral\ninfections like colds and flusbut also bacterial infections\nand fungal infectionsfor that matter.Now, I've talked before on this\npodcast about the importanceof using nasal breathing\nunder any conditions whereyou don't have to breathe\nthrough your mouth.So if you are not eating,\nif you're not speaking,or if you're not exercising\nhard which by the wayoftentimes requires that you\nbreathe through your mouth.There's nothing wrong with\nbreathing through your mouthif you're exercising\nhard and youneed to breathe\nthrough your mouthin order to bring\nin enough oxygen.There are conditions under which\nthat's entirely appropriate.You can learn more about\nthat in the podcast episodeI did all about breathing\nand breath work.But for the most part it's\nbest to be a nasal breatherexcept under the conditions\nI just mentioned.Why?Well, the nasal passages contain\na number of physical barriers,including the hairs\nwithin your nose.I know that hairs in\nthe nose, especiallyif they are super\nnumerous are notconsidered aesthetically nice.People will trim\nthem, et cetera.But those hairs in\nyour nose actuallyserve as a barrier\ntoward infection.This is well established.The lining of the nose, the\nmucosal lining of the nosecontains a lot of things.First of all, it acts as\nits own physical barrierand physical trap for incoming\nviruses, fungal infections,and bacterial infections.They literally get trapped\nin the nasal passages.And therefore can't enter\ndeeper into your physiology.And right now is\nnot the time to gointo the whole\nanatomy and physiologyof the nasal passages.But keep in mind if\nyou saw the episodethat I did with Noam Sobel\nor you listen to the episodethat I did on olfaction,\nboth of those episodeshighlight the fact that\nyour brain sits notfar behind your nasal passages.There's a bony barrier there\ncalled the cribriform plate,and there are some\nother things as well,but it's not far from your\nnostrils to your brain.And it is not far\nfrom your nostrilsto the rest of your\nrespiratory pathway, of course.And so the hairs of your\nnostrils, the mucus itself,and the microbiome,\nthe trillionsof little micro\nbacteria that thrivein the mucosal lining of\nyour nasal passages actuallyserve to protect against many\nof the incoming infections.This is why it's so\nimportant to keepthe mucosal lining of your nasal\npassages thriving and intact.How do you do that?Well, one of the\nbest ways to do thatis to make sure that the\nair that you're breathingis sufficiently humidified.So while there are many\ndifferent claims out thereabout how to avoid\ncolds and flus,as long as we're having a\ndiscussion about why thereare more colds and flus\nin the winter monthsbecause indeed there\nare, it's worthmentioning that if you\nsuffer from colds and flusand you're going to\nspend a lot of timein particular\nindoor environment,you might be wise to find a\nair humidifier, something thatbrings more moisture\ninto the airthat you're breathing especially\nat night while you're sleeping.Now, that's not going to prevent\nthe person in your environmentwho happens to\nhave a cold or fluand is sneezing actively from\ntransmitting that cold or flu.But it will keep\nyour nasal passagesand the rest of your\nrespiratory pathwaysas healthy as they can\nbe and as resistantas they can be to\nany colds or fluesthat you might be fighting off.And this is another\nkey point, whichis regardless of\nwhether or not it'sthe winter months or the\nother months of the year,all day long you're combating\ndifferent types of infections.Different types\nof viral, fungal,and bacterial infections\nare bombarding your systemand your immune\nsystem counters thatboth through physical\nand through neurochemicaland hormonal and pure\nimmune mechanisms.OK.There's a whole discussion\nof this in the episodethat I did on the immune system.We'll do more on this.But keeping the air that\nyou breathe especiallyat night sufficiently\nhumidified is one great wayto try and offset colds and\nflus that you might be combatingbecause you brought\nthat cold or fluhome from work and your immune\nsystem needs to ward it off.OK.If you are having a\nhard time graspinghow it is that you could\nbring home a cold or fluand then ward it\noff, do you have it?Do you not have?It is it sitting there trying\nto get into your system?Or do you have it a little bit?Well, this is some\nof the gray areaaround cold and flu and\nviral transmission generally.I mean, we don't\nknow, for instance,if you got a mild\nsniffle as opposedto a really bad cold\nor flu whether or notit would have been a\nreally bad cold or flu,had you slept less, had you\nnot humidified your air better,et cetera.Probably it would be.And if you've ever not\nslept well for a little bitand you're sick, you\nexperienced just how much worsethat sickness feels.The symptoms of that sickness\ngo from very mild to moderateor from mild to\nmoderate to very severewhen you are sleep deprived.That said, it's also clear that\nsome strains of the cold or flucan be more mild than other\nstrains of the cold or flu.So this can be pretty nuanced.And we'll go deeper\ninto this in the episodethat I do on cold and flu and\nhow to avoid cold and flu.But nasal breathing whenever\npossible day and night timeis extremely important for\nencouraging the overall healthand resistance of\nyour respiratorypathways to incoming cold and\nflu and other types of viruses.Similarly, humidifying the air\nthat you breathe especiallyat night but perhaps also during\nthe day in your OFS environmentor home environment can also be\nvery beneficial for warding offcolds and flus.And if you'd like to read more\nabout the nasal versus mouthbreathing components\nof colds or flus,I'll just mention one\npaper now and again, I'llgo into this in more depth in\nthe future episode on coldsand flus.But I want to mention that\nthis is a bidirectional effect,meaning people who deliberately\nbreathe through their nosetend to get fewer\ncolds and flus.Also people who tend to\nbreathe through their mouthmore tend to get\nmore colds and flus.Now, you might think that's\nthe same thing or justtwo sides of the same coin.But actually it's not.There's what we call a\ndouble dissociation wherebyif people are mouth\nbreathers, theyare far more susceptible\nto colds and flusand other types of\nrespiratory illnesses.I'll put a link to\none particular paperthat I like a lot in the\nshow note captions entitledassociation of oral breathing\nwith dental malocclusionsand general health in children.This paper explores a\nlot of different thingsabout nasal versus mouth\nbreathing all of which,by the way point\nto the fact thatnasal breathing whenever\npossible is better for ushealth wise, aesthetically,\ndental health wisethan is mouth breathing.But one of the key\ncomponents here and this iswhy I bring it up in the\ncontext of this discussionis quote \"oral breathing is\nrelated to a significantlyhigher prevalence of allergies\nand a significantly more likelygetting sick and taking\nmedication for being sick.\"OK.So lots in this study,\nlots in related studies.But nonetheless, being a nasal\nbreather, humidifying your air,paying attention\nto whether or notyou're indoors with people\nwho are coughing and sneezingbecause it's cold outside,\nall of those thingsare going to be\nrelevant perhaps keepinga little bit of distance,\nmaybe a lot of distancefrom those people or encouraging\nthem to wash their handsafter they wipe their nose.Maybe even sending them to a\nlittle bit of not necessarilyisolation although\nthat might be necessarybut keeping them at a distance.I don't think it's too\nmuch to ask somebodywho's sick to not get you sick.Personally I think that's the\npolite thing to try and do.And there's actually\nnot many things ruderthan someone who\nknows that they'resick showing up to something\nbecause they didn't wantto miss that particular event\nand getting everybody else sickfrankly, that's my opinion.I think that opinion is\nshared with many of youout there as well.Now, as I mentioned earlier,\nwhen it's cold outside,the air tends to be drier.Not always.I mean, you could live\nin an environment that'svery cold and very rainy,\nobviously very rainyis very humid.It's maximum humidity\nif you think about it.But if you are going\nto spend time outof doors in cold days of\nwinter, which by the way,is a really good thing\nfor other reasons,I'll get into those\nreasons in a momentbecause they relate\ndirectly to why there'ssuch a prevalence\nof colds and flusbecause in general,\npeople are not doing whatI'm about to tell you to do.But there are two things\nto keep in mind if you'regoing to be out of doors.First of all, the things\nabout proximity still hold.There have been\nstudies of peoplewho have colds and flus\nsneezing in indoor environmentsversus outdoor environments and\nhow much transmission there is.Again, it boils\ndown to proximity.Yes, you can get a cold or\nflu from somebody sneezing outof doors next to\nyou just as wellas you can if they\nsneeze next to youindoors There's a slightly\nhigher probability that you'llget it from them if they're\nsneezing at that same distancebut you're indoors as opposed\nto outdoors obviously sneezers,coughers-- sneeze and cough\nin the other direction,cover your mouth and nose.If you don't have a tissue\nor something, we are toldand I subscribe to the idea\nthat sneezing into your elbowor coughing into your elbow\nis probably the next bestthing to not covering up at all,\nas opposed to into your hand,which then you touch\nother things and yourself.Anyway, without getting into\nthe mechanics of sneezingand coughing too\ndeeply, if you'regoing to be outside in\nthe cold winter monthsand you'd like to avoid getting\ncolds and flus, when you run,when you exercise,\nwhen you walk,when you're in conversation,\ntry to nasal breathe unless youhave to mouth breathe.And if you can sense your\nnasal passages or your mouthdrying out because of\nthat hard breathing,and by the way exercise\nduring the wintermonths is still important.So I'm not discouraging people\nfrom exercising outdoorsduring the winter months as\nlong as you can do it safely.But if you feel those\nair passages drying out,just be aware that when\nyou take those dried outair passages in doors and\nyou're around other people thatmight have colds\nand flus, you aregoing to be more susceptible.So that's cause for taking a\nhot shower, perhaps if you haveaccess to a steam\nroom or humidifier,and rehydrating those\nnasal and oral passages.Now, if you're\noutside and runningand you're breathing hard and\nyour nasal passages are dryingout, does that mean that you're\nmore susceptible to coldsand flus that are just\nout in that environmentif no one else is around?Chances are no.However, what we\nwere all told whenwe were kids which is if you\ngo outside and you get a chill,it's a good idea when\nyou come back insideto take a hot\nshower or a hot bathor if you have access to\nit a sauna to heat back up.That's also true, why?Well, it does seem that\nthere's a relationshipbetween core body temperature\nand susceptibilityto cold and flu.And this is something\nI'm going to godeeply into in the\nepisode on colds and flus.Keep in mind that fevers that\nare the response to exposureto a cold or flu or being full\nblown sick with a cold and fluare an attempt of your immune\nsystem to heat up that virusand destroy it.Keep that in mind if\nyou're consideringtaking any medication to\nlower your fever, of course,know that highly elevated\nbody temperatures a.k.a. fevercan be very dangerous\nto the brain and body.There's a fairly\nlimited upper rangeof temperatures that we\ncan go into before westart damaging ourselves.But also keep in mind that\nfever is an adaptation designedto destroy viruses.So if you blunt the\nfever, you are actuallyletting a cold or\nvirus to proliferatemore readily than it\nwould if you alloweda slight fever to combat that.OK.So there's a whole discussion to\nbe had there because obviouslyyou don't want people\ncooking their brainsdue to elevated fever and\nnot treating that fever.But you also don't want\nto reduce your core bodytemperature too much which\nraises the question of thingslike cold plunges.Should you be\ntaking cold showersand doing cold plunges\nin the winter monthswhen it's already cold and\nyou're susceptible to coldsand maybe you're coming\ndown with a cold,should you do that?Well, that segues\ninto the next questionthat I'm going to answer\nfor this AMA, which relatesdirectly to cold exposure\nand so-called cyclichyperventilation breathing\nsometimes associatedwith so-called Wim Hof breathing\nbut other forms of deliberatebreathing as well.And how specific forms of\ndeliberate breathing and howdeliberate cold\nexposure can indeedbe used to offset or even\nprevent entirely infectiondue to bacterial or viruses.But if you're\nalready coming downwith a bacterial\nor viral infection,why cyclic hyperventilation\nbreathing or why deliberatecold exposure may actually\nbe the worst thingif you are already contracting\nor have contracted,if you are contracting or\nhave already contracteda cold or virus.So we'll answer\nthat question next.In the meantime, just know\nthat yes, indeed in the wintermonths you are more\nsusceptible to colds and flusbecause there's more\nof them going around.We talked about some of\nthe reasons why they'regoing around, and\nsome of the thingsyou can do to protect yourself\nagainst those colds and flus.There are a bunch\nof other thingsthat you can do that are very\nvaluable that will explorein the full length\nepisode on colds and flusand how to avoid getting them.And I'm hoping you all\nstay clear of coldsand flus these winter months.And now you have some\ntools to try and reducethe duration and severity\nof those colds and flusshould you get one.Thank you for joining\nfor the beginning"
