stage as opposed tosomebody who's like you know 90% doneand they just can't finish the last10% what are your thoughts about thesekinds of blocks and how to overcome themum any experience you've had with themyourself and perhaps with uh workingwith other artists the first thought isto go past the idea of the block andthink about what whatis what's the cause of theblock and the block is usually somethinglike it's either a personal I'm not goodenough it's it can be a confidenceissue I don't have anything tosay or it could be aum thinking about someone else nobody'sgoing to like what Imake do do you know what I'm saying soit's either a A self-judgment or fear ofoutsidejudgment so if you're makingsomething with a with a freedomof this is something I'm making formyself for now that's all itis it's a diaryentry everything I make is a diaryentry the beauty of a diary entry is Ican write my diaryentry and you can't tellme my diary entry wasn't good enough orthat's not what I that's not what Iexperienced of course it's what Iexperienced it's I'm writing a personaldiary for myself no one else can judgeit it is my experience of of mylife everything we make can be that canbe apersonal

whereI feel good about it and where it'shonest it's honest of where I'mat and if you're living in this world ofjust being honest to where you'reat there's nothing blocking that do youknow what I'm saying there are no blocksthe blocks are all basedon dealing with a different force or adifferentperception that is made up you know youmake up this story and you're living thestory I'm in this blockbecause I just can't do it the reasonyou can't do it is because you're afraidsomeone else is not going to like it oryou're there are no blocks is there'sinfinite amount of information out thereto

if you go for a walkchances are you'll see something that'llspark something in you as a as a seed totake offfrom that makes a lot of senseand I had a thought while you weresaying that one of the challenges that Ihave in completing work and getting intoa good work Groove is that um especiallynowadays because of phones and so easyto communicate with other people it'snot that they interrupt me it's that andand this happened the other day I set upmy new office really nicely I'm livingin a very quiet place now it's likealmost completelysilent unless I'm playing music it'sreally interesting or the coyotessometimes come around and start doingtheir thing at night but completelysilent and I realized I was having ahard time getting into a work Groove andI realized that I felt compelled tocontinue to reach out to people and thenI realize as you just provided youranswer to the last question that youknow there's probably something in methat has a bit of a fearof separation or abandonment from Peoplebased on my own experience and I feelvery well supported by my friends andco-workers these days very very wellsupported I'm in a kind of Pinch Meplace around that and but I realize nowthat what's happening in my mind is it'snot a challenge of getting into the workit's a fear that if I spend a couplehours really in that tight tunnel ofcreation thatthere might not be anyone there when Iexit it which is a crazy thought that'sa crazy thought but that's the anxietyand I only realize that now yeah sothank you great you know I trust thatyou guys will be there when I when Iexit the tunnel and when there's adeadline I have no choice but to jumpinto that tunnel that that's actually uhwhat helps deadlines really help me dodeadlines help you do you like deadlinesuh

            "text": "averse to high-intensity stimulationthink last night we went to the aew andby the way thank you for taking me thatwas such an incredible experience it wasreally fun it was really fun it remindedmeof early punk rock shows where like someof my first punk rock shows where I wentand just was like oh my gosh this isexciting and scary and I love it yeahand it felt loving too yes which is alsothe community of punk rock that Iobserved and have been blessed to be apart of it's like I it's like there yeahthere's aggression but there's also loveand then there's romance and thenthere's also um betrayal and there's allthe elements but there's still a senseof like everyone wants to be here andthere's a sense of goodness behind itall even though some of it was bloodyand violent yes so for you what whatdoes wrestling allow you to feel inthose high-intensity environments itcompletely relaxes me because there areno Stakes you knownobody everyone's working together inthe show to protect each other no one'strying to hurt anybody regardless ofwhat the story line is it's like aballet where there's a fight in theballet there's no umthere's no actual aggression of peopletowards each other it's just theopposite but you get to experience thiswildly Dynamic excitingsurreal theaterpiece uh where people are doing these uhgymnastic and acrobatic things that aretruly deathdefyingum and it's fun and the the story linesabsorb you in a way where you know younever know what's true and what's not Moyou know we know wrestling's fake we'retold wrestling's fake but there'ssomething um legitimate aboutit that seems to me more legitimate thananything else the mostlegitimate because it's the closest towhat the world's actuallylike people don't always tell you whatthey really think and when someone tellsyou a story it might not really be thetruestory they may even think they may bethey may think they're telling you thereal story and that might not be thereal story we don't know we know solittle you know we we we experiencesomething and then we make up a story tounderstand itourselves and then forever more when wetell that story it was our version of aof an experience but we don't knowthat's what happened that was our takeonit um wrestling is like that's what thereal world islike because we when you watch wrestlingyou never know what's true that's whatif you watch the news like you watchwrestling and you never know what's trueit's more it would be more accurate youyou'd have a better sense of the worldif you took it all in like it was prowrestling I think we're in a place inhuman history where people are startingto feel that way about the media it'salso why wrestling's so popular you knowit's it's uh more popular than it's everbeen yeah that's interesting things likeUFC kind of gladiator like octagonfights and wrestling are increasing inpopularity despite the fact thatsupposedly we're evolving so I think itreflects something both primitive andevolved about the human brain yes rightprimitive in the sense that yeah there'ssome violence it's physical that's downin the hypothalamus as we'd say no itscratches thatitchbut they're actually protecting eachother you know it scratches that itch ofseeing theGladiators but it's like watching amovie you know it's not they're notreally it's they're not really hurtingeach other they get hurt but onlybecause the things they're doing are socrazy I think in order to be able tothoroughly enjoy wrestling one has to beable to give up narrative distancingjust a little bit right narrativedistancing is this sense that this is astory it's a movie it's it's not realbut there were moments like yesterdaythe the jump off the top rope onto theguy who SPL out on the ladder the ladderbreaks this was right in front of us itcouldn't have felt good no he walkedaway he seemed fine yeah uh is but thatand then um there was a match betweentwo women where a woman put a metalplate into her uh into the bottoms ofher suit and then ran in then jumpedonto the other woman and you know hither with the metal and then the metalplate kind of slipped out and she waswalking around and everyone knew she hadcheated cuz you're not supposed to usethe metal plate but so it was sort ofexciting cuz she had done it excitingcuz she had gotten away with it and thenat the same time exciting and upsettingthat the referee saw it but then didn'tcall it this is like Twitter X this islike Instagram this is like politicsthis is like this is real life rightlike seeing people get away with thingsis so frustrating if you feel theyshouldn't have yeah that's all part ofit it's like uh it's a very uh accuraterepresentation of the world love it II'm it's it's weird because I neverwould have thought I'd be hooked I'mhooked it's like archery andprofessional wrestling now it's like I'mgoing to be busy guy in24 I'm going to come back to this verypractical question and ask a differentquestionfirst there are a few comments in herethat are just Priceless by the way sowanted to point out that you're a Piscesand so isEinstein a couple of historicalquestions I know you're not big onanswering historical questions umnecessarily maybe you are but I can'thelp every time I see you asking aquestion about the Ramones or asking aquestion about Joe Strummer but I I likethis question first of all it starts offI love Rick Rubin he's so fascinatingthere's so many questions that startthatwayon the podcast that you did with JoeRogan uh you talked about yourexperience with Johnny Cash and seeinghim in a new light after doinginterviews for a book about Johnny orsomething like that um the question thisperson asked was from your present viewwhat was the most impactful moment ormoments from being with him and workingwith him or simply do you recall amoment working with Johnny Cash that youparticularlyenjoyed uh I enjoyed anytime I got tospend time with him he was a reallySoulfulseriousshy quiet man incredibly knowledgeablehe knew a great deal about history and aso much about music he knew every songhe didn't he may not have known modernsongs but he knew the history ofMusic um reallywell and there was just a a humblehonesty about himthat came through I think that thestrength of him as an artist was when hesaid words even if he didn't write thewords if he told a story in words youbelieved thatstory so he had a a crediblegravitas and um he was great because ofwho he was it wasn't his ability as asinger it wasn't his ability as asongwriter or although he was a greatsongwriter and he was a great singer butthat's not why he was Johnny Cash He wasJohnny Cash because of the humanbeing underneath and anything that thatguy would havedone we would be interested in becausethat's how much of a beam of light hewas on the planet it just happened to bemusic just happened to bemusic I lovethat one question that came up a lot andI I think I can understand understand"

but I think thisis a feeling that I hear people Expressa lot like how do I know if I'm on theright path and I just want to remindyour earlier answer that you're prettycomfortable with uncertainty yeah thisand the unknown and I think that's arare trait the question of worth it isreliant on anoutcome we don't make these things foranoutcome it's it's it's not the mindsetto make somethinggreat the outcome happens you're makingthe best thing you can make it's a it'sa devotional practice whatever happensafterthat happens and that part that happensafter it is completely out of yourcontrolputting any energy into that part that'sout of your control it's a waste of timeall it is all it does is undermine yourwork your work is to make the best thingyou can so any thought you have aboutoutcome undermines the wholething let that one sink in I thinkthat's so important for people to hearand I'll say it's okay to think aboutoutcome after you finished the thingyou're making once you've made it thenyou can say hm what can I do to turnpeople on to this but in the making ofit it'spremature which brings my mind back tothat diary entry like approach becausewhen you do a diary entry if you lie toyourself you're going to get a lot lessout of it it's it's a ridiculous idealying in your diary entries it is wellit's so interesting because when youlearn how to do really good science andI was fortunate to work with someone whowas truly committed to the truth andaccuracy she used to just say wheneverthere was a scandal published likesomeone fabricated data she was likethis is so crazy like like why would youget into science you'd be if you want tomake you be better off going intosomething else so clearly they weren'tthose people who make up data were notin science for discovery of Truth asbest we can understand it they were intoit for something else but it's the sameway you do you formulate a question thena hypothesis and then you just go seewhat is and what isn't and thenafterwards you decide well is this apaper that's send to a top journal or amediocre Journal but you can't controlthe outcome so it's very similar exactlythe same and and it you'll see it in somany different aspects of Life Beyondart it's it's I think one of the thingsthat was interesting that came up inwriting the book is itstarted being about art and I came torealize as I was putting the ideastogether that it seems like regardlessof what you do in life if you followthese principles your life life willprobably improve you'll probably be abetter husband or a better father or abetter whatever it is it'sum it seems like the the art is anoutgrowth of it's why the subtitle is away of being it's like youcreate yourself in a way in the worldwhere the things that you make aretapped into somethingdeep but that comes from you beingtapped into something deep that's how itwork works so tapping into selfgrounding in self not thinking aboutoutcome diary entry like approach tocreatingstuff seems to be the and I I think onething I'll I'll say to that because Isay tapping into self it doesn't comefrom the self but you have to tap intoyourself because you're the vessel toallow it to comeout everything in the vessel is comingfrom somewhereelse it's not it's not yourcreation you're theum it's like you're the sculptor or theyou're the data an analyst where you'retaking these things from differentplaces that you've noticed some thingsthat you've noticed some things that youdon't know that you've noticed but youdid you know that's how we learned youknow we take in a lot of informationthat we don't even know we're takingin but the way we can take these datapoints that are inside of us that camefrom outside of us and create aconstellation that's what that's whatthe artist job is but also that's whatwe all do all the time and to get betterat it it's getting more in tune withyourself and opening yourself to thingsoutside of um I'll say if you have anarrow beliefsystem you'll have less information toto work with less data points so beingopen-minded and um allowing surprise tobesurprised holding all of your beliefsveryLoosely it's interesting because it theway you describe this and from knowingyou as well it it seems that this wholeprocess is best served by having reallygood boundaries like notgetting um foggy about what's about youand what's about somebody else or aboutwhat other people want or the worldwants but also having really goodantenna and being able to see what'shappening in the world you can't becloistered and and like this no um butpart of the creative process kind offeels and looks like you you're inyou're in a tunnel but then you you haveto bring in from the outside I mean thatum so it seems like making these two twoseparate compartments that you canBridge um seems important and healthy Imean here as you mentioned it's a way ofbeing it's not just about creatingthings that's also a healthy way to bein the world because if you'reconstantly getting pulled around byeverything emotionally and things areupsetting you that's not good but ifyou're just cut off fromeverything that's not goodeither do you cultivate that way ofbeing through these practices um or doyou think you've been there's somethingabout the way you're wired that youstarted off that way it feels natural tome it feels natural to me and I'll tellyou when I was younger I thought I wouldlive in New York City my whole life andthere was a time when I felt like havingthat energy and noise around me feltgood now I feel best in the jungle ortheforest I didn't decide that I didn'tdecide what feels good you know it itjust happened so you're clearly willingto update and adapt change yournutrition change your city the way youfeel get new information update love ityou're a scientist AB well I don't knowanything again we start with I knownothing we all knownothing so if something soundsinteresting worth trying I'll try it seedoes it work does it not work you know Ithought at one point in time I thoughtveganism was a good idea I was excitedaboutit and I did it for a long time I didn'tget the results I was hoping for Ididn't have Better Health

that for youwhen theinternet came to be that it must havebeen really exciting because like me youlove foraging for information I used togo to the library and Xerox copy papersand I loved looking

ourfingertipsand sometimes have having so muchinformation isum it's hard to sort I'll tell you aquick a quick story which was when themusic streaming Revolution happened Iwas really excited the idea that all ofmusic is in my pocket now and I canlisten to any any song any album fromany point in my life or I get to hearabout something and it's all accessibleright now in this moment and I wasthinking at that timeI'm just going to DJ all I'm going to dois DJ and I'm going to listen toanything I can think of that I'm excitedabout haven't heard the Talking Heads ina while let's listen to Talking Headsjust how great that that freedom is tohave everything at your fingertips andwhat I came to learn very quickly is Idon't want to DJ all day I love that Ihave the ability to DJ all day I lovethat when there's something I want tohere I can find it but I don't want tohave to do the work of pick everythingI'm going to listen to I like beingprogrammed to and I like the discoveryof somebody else playing something thatI wasn't expecting and getting to enjoythat so now I do more listening toeither somebody's curated playlists oruh online radio stations and I do lesspicking music to listen to but I neverwould have known that before because Ialways thought well if I could listenanything I want I want to listen to whatI want to listen to I didn't know that Ididn't want to have to pick it I lovethe rare lie versions and um bsides andwhatever Z sides that one can find onYouTube like the other day you sent mejust at random a a clip from I think itwas aJapanese television show with theRamones opening up um and Johnny opensupwith you're loud mouth baby you bettershut up and then they theyyeah and I it's the song I could haveheard anywhere else but it was the factthat it was shot fromabove that it was black and white andthat he adds this little riff at thebeginning you're a loud mouth baby youbetter shut up and then just dives intoit that made it for me as a huge Ramon'sfan I was like yeah like you know Ithink I did that in my kitchen yeah likeI was so hyped because when you go andjust listen to asong that's recorded as part of an albumyou're not not going to get thoseadditionalpieces back in the day and still now ifyou went to a live show you might seethat and hear that and never forget thatbut in that sense to me YouTube and andthe internet is like wow like it's thisAR Archive of gems that I I potentiallyhave been there maybe it was 79 I wouldhave been four years old yeah so youknow um anyway thanks for sending methat clip loved it because you know howmuch I love the rones but um things likethat I just think God the Internet isjustamazing and so spectacular yeah and theamount of lectures you could find onYouTube areunbelievable the the greatest thinkersin the world I I don't want to say areon YouTube because they probably didn'tpost on YouTube but their material is onYouTube and it's unbelievable you knowthings from old films from the 50s

gave me this thefollowing advice so I'm injecting my ownquestion he said the sooner you can getto a complete draft that you're happywith or happyish with the better theprocess will go so I'm working ongetting that complete draft yeah I wouldsay don't Focus too much on any of theindividual details until you have thewhole thing down and then you can focuson all making everything better that youwant to make better don't get boggeddown in that at the expense of gettingthrough theproject your advice has really beenhelping me by the way great I'm doing itlike diary entries great and I've kept adiary for many years so that's somewhatnatural tell me a little bit about yourdiary entries how long how long is adiary entry sure yeah um a diary entryis anywhere from like one to eighthandwritten pages single line spacinggoing back and forth between I usuallystart in all capitals and then switchover to cursive as I speed up uh I'vebeen doing that since gosh since highschool School I've got a drawer filledwith them dated and everything and umit's usually a process of just trying toget something out of my system that Ifeel is is like clogging me somefrustration with the outside world butsometimes like this morning I journaleduh in the room before you showed up andI just was like I think I was ridinghigh off wrestling last night I wasmarveling at how similar the Greatexperiences of my life are now as theywere to every other stage of my life inthe sense that they give me this feelingof like okay like they're these gems andI'm of people you and othersand experiences and I'm finding themlike I'm experiencing them and remindingmyself that there there are long periodsin between those moments where thingsfeel kind oflike not empty certainly not empty butbut kind of frustrating in the sense oflike I'm busy and I'm dealing with abunch of things and things don't feelsmooth and um but I've been throughenough of these cycles that Ijust I'm really learning to enjoy thecycles and that was it and uh I and Ithink the last line in my entry wassomething like you know and you know andI can't wait for more or something sothis morning is just a very positiveentry but sometimes you know I mean theydefinitely some tear stained entries andthey definitely some entries where I'mjust so pissed I can barely get thewriting out but it's it's a process oflike getting that stuff out so then Ican lean into the day do you ever goback and look at them I did the otherday because I recorded an episode on avery particular type of journalingthat's supported by over 200peer-reviewed studies which is calledexpressive writing I can tell you aboutit it's a process that was developed byJames pennebaker who is a professor atUniversity of Texas Austin and he hadhis studentsright as part of an experiment for 15minutes a day for just four dayseither consecutive days or a week apartbut about the same thing and the thingthat they're supposed to write about isthe most challenging upsetting or eventraumatizing experience of their lifeand it shows that the data from over 200studies show incredible positive shiftsin Psychology physiology immune systemfunction and ability to combatinfections I was so struck by the datafrom this work that I decided todedicate a whole podcast episode to itit'll probably be out by time um thisepisode airs but um I haven't done thatone yet I'm going to do it it's a littlebit of a higher bar entry cuz it's likeokay I'm going to I hear that the firstday especially is pretty upsettingbecause you're purposely pickingsomething really hard butum yeah but most of the journaling I dois just kind of diary like here's whathappened here's what's going on and mybiggest fear is that somebody would findthem but in preparation for that episodeabout penne Baker I went and looked atmy journals was like what do I writeabout and I realized they're prettyautobiographical um sometimes abouttroubling things but never before had Iwritten four times in a row about theexact same thing interesting yeah yeahpennebaker I think deserves a NobelPrize if you look at the data on thiscompared to and I'm not disparagingprescription drugs per se but like ssrisfordepression it's like at least as good atreatment it's like zero cost stuff butit you know and on and on you don't tobe careful I'll start giving the podcastagain now there were a number

            "text": "entertainment and musicindustry none of which unfortunatelywere particularly complimentary of quotethe industry and I think this issomething that comes up a lot becausepeople often focus on the marketing thepersonalities that may or may not be sopleasant at times I'm sure there are aton of pleasant Personalities in theindustry too but the question is thishow do you deal with the and these aretheir words Soul crushing anti- creativeaspects of the entertainment industryand hold on to that sense of creativityand love for the work I'm just focusedon the work I don't think of myself aspart of the um the entertainmentindustrialcomplex I just make the things I makeand then there are other people who aregood at figuring out how to sell them orget them into stores or get them ontoservices do you have a process ofcapturing ideas like do you write themdown um and the reason this questioncame up so many times I think is that alot of people feel like they get greatideas right upon waking or while drivingor in the shower at random times andthey were wondering whether or not youhave any way of collecting and curatingyour ideas prior to embarking on quoteunquote aproject uh I I write them I make notesin my phone I do it all the time I don'thave a great way of doing it andsometimes I'll make a note and then comeback to it later and have no idea whatit means do you make those notes uh bywriting or by uh like voice memo writingthat said voice memo might be asomething worth trying I've never triedthat how do you view money inrelationship to your work meaning how doyou place it in the constellation ofthings related to a project youmentioned earlier you let other peopledo the negotiationsbut money is just another form of energyum H how do you place it in the in theContour of what you do I I don't I trynot to think of it at all and I becauseI come from a punk rock background whichwas like a do-it-yourselfbackground it was always more about theidea and the execution of the idea withwhatever you could use to do it so if Ididn't have uh enough to go to aprofessional recording studio then Iwould find a friend who had a homerecording studio and recorded orwhatever it was or borrowing a drummachine when I before I had a drummachine I would always find ways to makethe things I wanted to make andum I I can't remember a time where afinancial boundary got in the way ofmaking something and I see it happeninga lot around me and it umI think some people look at it as themoney is what allows it to happen and Ithink I I just see it as the ideas whatallows it to happen and then theIngenuity is figuring out how to do itwith you know by any means necessaryjust got to make it whatever the thatversion is it may not be the dreamversion but whatever version you canexecute is the one for you tomake I can attest to the fact that Ilaunched my podcast in my closet inTanga Canyon yeah which felt felttotally natural cuz I also come from theskateboarding punk rock thing where likewouldn't ever occur to me to like get aprofessional studio built like we're innow we had this one built for us but atthe time like of course you use a closetbecause you just need a black backdropand you know I think starting from theremakes so much sense and you also realizein the minimalist approach you knowanything added is just something addedso you don't really know what you needif you start with a lot of stuff aroundyou yeah it's it can just be adistraction I'm friends with Darrenaronowski who's a great director and hisfirst movie was called pie and he madeit for practically no money and it wasreally well-loved and then the nextmovie he made was also wildly successfuland he made it for very little money andthen he made this huge hundred millionmovie and it wasn't it turned out not tobe a success that movie and it was acase of where having more money didn'thelp him tell astory it's just one particular caseum and it's no rule to follow uh butthere is something about making theversion that you can make with the meansthat you have that addssomething real to the project that maybe better than the one that has a lot ofmoney thrown at it I'm L that sink inaround a lot of online tutorials forscience have a lot of visuals but weknew we wanted to do YouTube but alsojust pure audio and it there's nothingmore frustrating than somebody talkingabout something or somebody that youcan't see because you're just listeningto it um and the visuals were reallyexpensive to do right and in the end Ithink if PE I firmly believe in theclassroom as well as viapodcasting if people can hear somethingclearly enough and create an image intheir own mind of how they wouldvisualize it then it's in there for goodwhereas just having people look at aslide with with a bunch of beautifulillustrations on it that does nothingfor retention ofmaterial um so I think the minimalistapproach I think sometimes is really thebest one maybe it's always the best onebecause it forces the better solutionlike the in anycase I do realize I editorialized therefolks I entered the answering portion ofthe not just the question askingportion have you ever felt thatsomething was too obscure for mainstream"

look at the space they're in andit's like chaos or they or their life iskind of chaos not all of thembut is what I'm saying making sensebecause I think why people Orient towardyou and one of the reasons for yoursuccess with the creative process isthat you extremely organized but not tothe point of beingrigid are you willing to embellish alittle bit on that perception whether ornot it's accurate inaccurate I would saythere's a part in the process early onwhere it is before it can getorganized where it's free and it'splayful and it can bechaotic um it's just not the it's abyproduct of whatever is happening itit's not it's good because it's chaoticand it's it it just happens to besometimes chaotic in that in thatexperiment in the beginning where we'rereally playing with this idea of

wrestling Idon't know but there's something aboutwhen you get to this these edges wherethis is not foreverybody it can get veryinteresting speaking ofum stuff that's not for everybody andthat to some people might have beenshocking I remember hearing Ghetto Boysfor the first time and like whoa likethey're taking certain things pretty farwhen you're working with an artist andthey venture out into that place wherethings are like maybe even a littleshocking what is that feeling for youinternally like is it how do youdistinguish between shock value for itsown sake and something that's reallyopening up a new creative Avenue orInsight like like how do you do yourecall the first time you you heard likeBushwick and those guys do their thingyeah what what was your internalnarrative I can't believe it I can'tbelieve what they're saying it's reallyum pushing the boundaries of what anyonehas said in this music before it hadswitched because the the original inoriginally in rap there was a lot ofboastingabout themselvesbragging and then we got to uh themessage happened and there was somesocialcommentary then there was gangster rapand then the Ghetto Boys took a versionof gangster rap and turned it intohorror rap which was much more graphicthan gangster rap gangster rap wastalking about a umum a real lifesituation whereas the Ghetto Boys tookit into horror movieterritory it was morefantasy um but it seemed really scary atthe time in the way that you're scaredat a great horror movie do you likehorror movies I don't do you likemonster movies where you know it's notreal like it'simpossible uh as opposed to horrormovies where you knowit's um you know people getting killedby another human like stuff that couldhappen in the world versus um you knowmonsters and zombies and that kind ofthing I don't think I really like eitherof them very much I like things thatmake me feel good I don't really likeadrenaline you know I don't like to beexcited for somereason inaudio I like something that makes meexcited but in visuals I tend not tolike things that make me excitedM interesting and you're able to kind ofclean yourself of experiences easilyright like it seems like if you listento something it's really shocking youdon't carry that shock to your sleep orto the next day like it doesn't troubleyou but a movie can can impact me likethere was a movie called Melancholiathat I saw years ago Lars vont Triermovie and I thought it was a verybeautiful movie but I was in a bad moodI would say for 3 months from the time Iwatched that movie on it just like didsomething to my brain that didn't feelgood and it couldn't snap out of it sointeresting there there are a few moviesthat have done that to me the movie BlueValentine which has done really wellum which is with Ryan goling and someoneelse where um it's a relationship Iwon't explain what happens in The Arc ofthe relationship but it just like themovie Haunted me there's one scene wherehe's wearing a misfit shirt and I waslike I like the and that's aparticularly good scene where he'ssinging to her um but the rest of themovie just brings about such feelings oflike just how hard life can be sometimesand how

I'llnote them but I avoid I avoid any kindof a work phone call or um anythingthat's stimulating or that will get methinking aboutit I aim for Sunset and then I'm usuallyinbed I'm usually in bed by10:and um and fall asleep within 15minutes your relationship to light isfascinating the sunlight piece makes alot of sense and will make sense to thelisteners of this podcast we haven'tdone too many episodes but we will domore that covers the trying to avoidbright light exposure in the evening umyou're wearing the red uh lens glassesnow even though it's the middle of theday that's because we've got thesebright lights around us correct and haveyou found that limiting your brightartificial light exposure in the eveninghas benefited you and in what waysabsolutely and and once you've done itonce you've changed and avoid likelooking at screens or my you know myphone turns red atnight when I see someone else's phone ifsomeone comes tovisitand their phone lights up at night it'sblinding and it's so disturbingand for them that's normal they're inthisheightened blown out place all the timeI'm staying at neutral I'm staying at atthe the the morenatural how how the world would be ifman didn't create all of these uh theseloud things loud loud um loud devicesyeah I've switched my phone thanks toyour input and we will have released aclip on this um by the time this episodeairs on the triple click approach to thephone that you can put in very easily umto allow it to go from regular screen tored screen at night so that you don'thave to go into the settings each timeyou just triple click U we'll provide alink to that um explanation and Ricktaught me that when I was over in Italyeveryone would in his home turned to meand uh said wait your phone is so brightyou got to do the red light thing I saidI don't know how and it taught me thatso it's a very useful trick um have younoticed a difference since looking athuge positive difference I sleep betterthere are great data now because ofcourse I go then and find the data thatum you know for shift workers peoplethat have to be up at night working ifthey put them under red light the amountof cortisol at that time is suppressedwhich is great um as compared to whenthey're under bright artificial lightswithout red lens glasses or if they'rein red lights it's far far morebeneficial less cortisol you wantcortisol High early in the day viewingsunlight early in the day increases itby at least 50% then you want it totaper off uh and on and on I heardsomething recently which is going tomake a lot of sense one thing that'shappened in the last 30 years which mayat least partially explain the Obesitycrisis isthat calories which are depleted ofnutrients micronutrients are very cheapnow see they're very cheap cheap to getcalories but they aren't nutritiouscalories in addition there's been achange in lighting technology so thatblue light photons are very cheap likewhen I was a kid they my parents wouldsay turn off the lights it's costing usall this money now it's very cheap tokeep the lights on in a home the heat isa different story but with respect so wehave a lot of cheap photons so I thinkof blue light as cheap photons not thegood for you photons not nourishingphotons that's great and consumingcalories too often or at the wrong timesof day we know is bad for you consumingphotons in the wrong form at the wrongtime of day bad for you and I thinkthose two things combined plus all thedownstream negative Cascades can largelyexplain the Obesity and in some senseMental Health crisis interesting yeah sojust a there I editorialized again Irealized that we're trying to shift theratio to more Rick less Andrew but hecan't help himself he can't help himselfand Rick indulges me so actually therewere a number of questions in here that"

referring toI'm not wearing red lens glasses now butI have changed a lot of my healthpractices Andor sought out science totest whether or not some of the thingsthat you've been doing for a while makesense and indeed in every case they'vemade sense I'm not just saying thatbecause because you're here but you andI do a lot of the same things yeah we'rewe're interested and if it didn't workwe'd probably stop doing it eventuallyright it's like we're testing thingsright and I do believe that what startsout is crazy like Mike mener stuff oflow volume weight training with heavyweights it works so much better than thehigh volumes all that stuff is beingshown to be true in these peer- reviewedtrials so you know that's the nature ofscience it often comes science oftenfollows the practitioners by manydecadesMH you know it doesn't get there firstbecause it's a slower more iterativeprocess but some people need to seethose Clin iCal trials to feelcomfortable doing something I think thecreative process is uniquely separatedfrom academic science and academicscholarship in a way that I think hasreally benefited it I mean can youimagine if the Ghetto Boys had to get adegree in music theory in order to dowhat they do they wouldn't be the Ghettoboys right or Slayer they would not beSlayer yeah or Public Enemy yes or Adeleyes or Eminem right it's it's almost byvirtue of the fact that there is nodegree for that yeah per se that allowedthem to do what they did right yeahabsolutely so what are your thoughts onschooling and higher education or justeducation I mean you were at NYU whenyou launched your record label yougraduated NYU I um what are yourthoughts on getting a a quote unquoteformaleducation uh it seems like an obsoleteidea I think maybe there was a timewhere it would have been helpful andmaybe depending on the if the thing thatyou want tostudy um can only be learned in aninstitution maybe it would make sensebut I think the real world um getting aninternship or a um finding the rightmentor and going into the whatever thething is that you're interested inlearning about learning from people whodo it as opposed to uh the the system IthinkI think might be more a better use ofyourtime the creative process doesn't existin avacuum and relationships are a huge partof life one thing that I've heard yousay and that certainly I've been workingto internalize is this ideathat whatever relationships one has intheir life romantic relationships or notmarried or not kids or notthat the ideal circumstance is whereone's work is the most stressful part oftheir life yes can you tell us moreabout that yeah the the home is the umthe safe place from which you can go outand be a warrior and do all these greatthings and these crazy things you know Ihaveum I'm fearless when it comes to Art I'mnot Fearless when it comes tolife life is my relationshipsart is where we can do these crazythings and have fun and umtry extreme things and see what happensand it's a say that's a safe place to dothat because it's it's just expressionit's notum the things we make don't have torepresent who we are they're just thethings we make and that's a point of youit's like this is interesting to me inthis moment check it out that's all itis may have a completely differentfeeling tomorrow was in arelationship it's it's longtermhopefully and it's it's as long term asit's a productive relationship whereeverybody's getting what they want fromthat relationship everybody's needs arebeing met and everybody cares enough tomeet each other'sneeds I've always admired how rationalyou are about relation ships and thisnotion that like if everybody isn'tbeing honest there's no relationshipactually not it's a bad relationship butthere's actually no relationship nobecause if you ifyou if someone's not telling the truththen each person is experiencing adifferent understanding of theworld they're living in two differentworlds so they're not they're never Actactuallytogether when you're experiencing adifferent world so unless you can youdon't have to agree I'm not saying youhave to agree on everything but you haveto be truthful in saying this is how Isee it and your partner is clearin yes this is how I see it or no thisis how I seeit you're on the same you're on the samepage even even in disagreement but it'sreal it's you're you're being who eachof you are being who you are for andwith theother but if you're not opening yourselfup in that way to yourpartner you're in a different world theyhave an idea of what's Happening that'scompletely different than what you havean idea of what's Happening that's notthat's not being together nomasksno no it's the it's the same as whatwhen you said earlier about lying inyourdiary you'd only be doing a diservice toyourself lying in a relationship wouldonly be doing a disservice toyourself Mike Ness of Social Distortionas a song called cheating at solitirewhich seems like an appropriate title

answer but I think it'simportant that uh I not inject and thatuh I think people are interested in thiseven if they don't want to podcastbecause I think it it gets to theprocess of something that you're doingnow and how you're doing it now yeah umI didn't set out to do what I'm about totell you I didn't set out to do this butit's something that after I starteddoing it I came to realize it it's aninteresting thing and I actually learnedthis from listening to your podcast itwas actually Lex's podcast with you andI was listening to the podcast and Iknow you know Lex and I know you guysare friendsand both ofyou in addition to you talking to Lexyou're talking to the audience and Lexin addition to talking to you talks totheaudience and the a audience was aparticipant in yourconversation and I realized that in atthe tetramanpodcast it's different than that it'smore of anintimate personal like the interviewwith you that hasn't come out yet thatwas me talking toyou withno I certainly didn't have any idea thatanybody else was going to hear it otherthan yes someone else is hear it butthat's not what this is this is I wasasking you the questions I wasinterested in and I wanted to learn asmuch as I could and if you saidsomething either that I didn'tunderstand I'd ask you to explain it orif you told me a story about somethingthat sent me on a tangent that would Iwant to know more about this left sideof what you said or the right side ofwhat you said I would ask but onlyfollowing my owninterests so it has a an intimacy it'sturned into when I if if I listen to atetr gramon podcast it sounds like I'moverhearing aconversation a personalconversationand it it has turned into parts ofcertain decisions we' made like havingthere's music at the beginning and thenyou hear the guest more often than notis in the middle of a story and it'salmost as if you've walked into a roomand people are in this deep conversationand you're just sitting on the sidequietly and hearing this conversationand it's a a real moment that'shappening there and it's just differentI can't say it's better I can't say it'sworse can't say I don't know what what'sinteresting about it but something aboutit's interesting to me and when I listento it I feel a different kind of anintimacyum and again it wasn't premeditated thisis after the fact I'm looking back andunderstanding oh this is what it is thisis why this isdifferent yeah the podcast that I didwith you on your podcast when I wasfeatured as I guess the second time I Icompletely forgot that we werepodcasting it was also good we'd had afewdays together overseas there we're in avery kind of isolated environment thathelped me get out of the mode of thereare listeners yeah there's no there's nosense of performance involved it's itcouldn't be more casual and the reason Ichose not to film it is because thenature of lights andcameras make it harder to forget thatyou're doing itso I aim for it to be as natural anexperience so that you can have theconversation that you really would haveif there were no lights and cameras notthat not that we want to reveal anythingit's just it's a level of comfort andopenness where you're talking tosomebody you like and it's you'reenjoying the conversation and that's soyou I just have to share that you knowthe first time we met in person you andI had facetimed a number of timesprevious to that but the first time wemet in person came over to your house weended up doing sauna and cold and I wasgoing through a particularly challengingtime in my life I mean it had reallyjust hit me square in the face and Iremember saying Hey listen I I don'tknow if we could talk about this but Ijust opened up about all of it andthat's the moment when like we wouldhave become friends anyway but that'swhere things really took off because Ikept apologizing at the end I I'm sosorry and you said no no this isactually what we're supposed to do yeahand you know I'm feel very grateful thatwe've remained close friends ever sinceand that catalyzed a lot but I thinkthat one of the things I love aboutpodcasts not just podcasting butpodcasts is that the really effectivepodcasts like yours like Lex's likeRogan like RichR Tim Ferris they really reflect thelove and passion that the person has forthat kind of conversation I mean I cancertainly say this about my podcast II've been learning organizing anddistributing information since I was youknow you know six years old MH so mypodcast is just that you you like realconversation and real things that areunb barriered by like the idea thatmaybe someone's going to listen and howwill it work out just like we talkedabout earlier and you answered thequestions that way and I think Lex likesLex's form of thing and Joe is doing hisform of thing and I think that's to meone of the great gifts of podcasting ifanyone wants to know how to create asuccessful podcast quote unquotesuccessful it's have the kind ofconversations and talk about the kindsof things you really love like CameronHaynes has this lifr run shoot podcastwhere you go to his house you do aworkout then you go for a run and thenhe teaches you archery and the reasonit's so effective is that he loveslifting running and shooting and then heand he loves teaching people that so atthe end of the day you're sitting downtalking about a great day that embodieseverything that he's about and and theperson learned and like I couldn't dothat podcast I can go on as a guest andI loved being a guest but I think that'sthe message and it brings us back towhat you were talking about earlier andthroughout today's discussionis that if you're thinking about howit's going to land how the hell could itever work yeah it's just a differentthing I had a conversation yesterday uhfor the podcast with Daniel kuuya whoI've never met before incredible actorand beautiful human being and weprobably talked for about 3 hours and itwas a deep conversation and I feel likeI might have a new best friend like he'sunbelievable the coolest guy if I wasn'tdoing the podcast I don't know if Iwould have met him if it just worked outit worked out that I got to meet thisincredibleperson well Rick we covered most of themost frequently asked questions andyou've been extremely gracious with yourtime and thoughtfulness in answeringthem and um I don't know what to sayexcept thank you for taking the time todo yet another podcast to answer theaudience's questions they were here inthis podcast in the form of this verylarge stack of of questionsand of course your book includes a lotof information that encapsulates thisbut I think this really fleshes out someof the the details of like how you goabout things how certain things can't bethe same for everybody and um I think inanswering these questions you provided agreat service to people who are perhapsstill struggling with getting thecreative process going or flowing um I'mcertain that it's going to change theway that I focus and lean into my dayI've got a number of different noteshere and maybe I'll be willing to sharethem with people but then that would goagainst the principle of this is for meand everyone's going to work it outtheir own way so we'll provide links toeverything that was mentioned wherethere's a link that's relevant and yeahman I want just want to say thank you somuch for being such an incredibleeducator and such an incredible friendas well thank you it's a funny idea ofbeing an educator I can't imagine thatbut I appreciate the uh I appreciatethose words well you are indeed aneducator we're learning so much from youand and if you just step back for asecond and think about all the creativeworks that have stemmed and are going tostem from the learnings that people haveachieved from hearing your experience inwisdom it's um incalculable wow I'lltake it thank you sir thank you forjoining me for today's discussion about"
