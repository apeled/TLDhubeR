            "text": "mindset as the name suggests is the ideathat we can get better at things that isthat our abilities are not fixed butrather that our abilities are malleableand at the core of growth mindset is theidea that our brains can change andindeed they can we refer to that abilityas neuroplasticity or the the nervoussystem's ability to change in responseto experience now I've done severalepisodes about neuroplasticity so that'sa topic unto itself but suffice to saythat neuroplasticity Brain Change canoccur throughout the entire lifespan itis far more robust early in life frombirth until about age 25neuroplasticity is sort of the defaultprocess our brain is being shaped by oureveryday experiences but certainly fromage 25 and onward and certainly wellinto people's 90s even it's been shownthe brain can change if we want it to itcan change for the worse of coursethrough injury or disease things of thatsort but it also can change for thebetter through deliberate focused boutsof learning we can learn new languageswe can learn art we can learn music wecan get smarter we can get better atessentially anything if we devote ourattentional resources to learning thosethings so really any discussion aboutgrowth mindset has as a subtext adiscussion about neural elasticityalthough today we aren't going to focusso much on neuroplasticity meaning wearen't going to focus so much on theneural circuit and neurochemical changesthat underlie neuroplasticity becauseI've covered those on previous episodeswe'll talk about them a little bit todaybut we are mainly going to talk aboutthe data the studies from the field ofpsychology applying growth mindset inand out of the classroom in children andadults and we are going to talk abouttools everyday tools that you can use toenhance growth mindset for yourself andperhaps for those around you if you careto teach growth mindset which is you'lllearn later turns out to be an excellentway to reinforce your own growth mindsetand we're going to talk about how toapply those tools in a bunch ofdifferent domains musical athleticintellectual and on and on no discussionof growth mindset would be completewithout mentioning that growth mindsetis the brainchild of my colleague Caroldweck in the department of psychology atStanford Universitytoday you'll learn how she discoveredgrowth mindset and you will learn howothers have taken that Discovery andexpanded upon it and especially itsapplication in and out of the classroomto start off our discussion about growthmindset however we need to Define what amindset is I think most of us think weknow what a mindset is we think oh it'skind of a a mental stance where you knowwe are positive or we are negative or webelieve something or we don't believesomething but a mindset actually has avery specific definition and here I'mreferring to the definition provided byDr Ali Crum Ali Crum is also a professorof psychology at Stanford she runs herown laboratory working on stress-relatedmindsets and other mindsets she'sactually been a guest on this podcastpreviously highly recommend you listento that episode if you haven't alreadyDr Crum defines a mindset as quote amental frame or lens that selectivelyorganizes and encodes informationand I think the key thing to highlightthere is organizes information becauseas you all well know we are constantlybeing bombarded with information fromthe outside world sensory informationabout what's going on with our visualsystem what we're hearing what we'reseeing what we're feeling we are alsobombarded with internal sensations ofhow full or empty our gut feels are wehungry are we tired are we anxious arewe calm Etc so tons and tons ofinformation funneling into our brain andmindsets really help us organize thatinformation such that we pay attentionto certain things and not others and werespond to certain things and not othersokay so here I'm not trying to putadditional language on something simplein order to make it complex I'm tryingto put a little bit of language that isthat a mindset does many things but itmainly organizes information I'll add tothat for specific actions or inactionsin a way that allows us to simplify ourworld in a way that allows us to makecertain choices and do away withthinking about and acting on other typesof information the other thing aboutmindsets is that they include entirenarratives and most of the time wearen't even aware of how thosenarratives are operatingmeaning we don't walk around looking atopportunities in the world like theopportunity to get better at Fitness ora sport or music or arithmetic orlanguages or anything for that matterthinking okay what is my mental frame orlens that selectively organizes andencodes information we don't do thatinstead what we have are stories andthose stories are usually attached toour sense of identity like I'll just usemyself for instance I do not think ofmyself as a good musician in fact Ican't read music I'm terrible at playinginstruments I like listening to musicbut I consider myself a terriblemusician right I've really assigned avalue or I've assigned my value to musicand my relationship to music right wetend to do that we can also do it in theopposite direction right I'm running alaboratory for a long time been inscience for you know close to threedecades so if you ask me you know do Ifeel proficient at science I'd say yeahI'm proficient at science I know how todo experiment setup experiments writeresearch papers write grants Etc I'mpretty good at it right we tend todecide if we are good or bad at thingsand we tend to integrate those with ouridentity somewhat or a lot to dependingon whether or not you know we're aprofessional or amateur how much weengage in an activity the point beingthat mindsets include all of thesenarratives and often those narrativesare visible to us if we think about thembut most of the time we are movingthrough the world meaning school workrelationships and all our endeavorswithout a lot of careful thought aboutthe narratives we carry and the beautyof growth mindset is that it forces usto step back and ask ourselves somesimple questions these are questionsthat you could ask yourself right nowand in fact I highly recommend you doyou could ask yourself for instance whathave I been told I'm really good at youshould also ask yourself what have Ibeen told I'm really poor at that I'mjust not good at what have I told myselfI'm really good at and what have I toldmyself I'm really bad at and then asecond set of questions is what am Igood at and why did it come naturally tome did I apply myself for many yearsmeaning did I apply a lot of effort tolearning that thing or perhaps bothright and then it's also important toask yourself why am I not good at otherthings is it simply because you've neverapplied yourself with those things or isit because you tried and had an earlyfailure or perhaps you tried and triedand tried for many years and youcontinue to fail at that thing or youjust didn't reach a level of proficiencythat made you want to pursue it furtherin asking yourselves those questions youare asking yourself not just what you'regood at and bad at and why you shouldalso be thinking about where themessages of being good at something orbeing bad at something arrived from didthey arrive from outside you meaningfrom your parents from your coaches fromyour teachers or was it the case thatdespite a lot of positive feedback youjust sort of decided you weren't good atsomething or conversely was it the casethat despite a lot of negative feedbackthat you would never be good atsomething or that you weren't good atsomething that you continue to persistbecause there are certainly people likethat the more negative feedback they getthe more they dig their heels in toprove themselves as capable of becominggood at something so I do recommend aswe March forward in this conversation"

identity isattached to the things that you are goodat or bad at and the reason I'd like youto ask yourself those questions is thatnext we're going to talk about someresearch from Dr Carol dweck'slaboratory that was really the seed ofthe entire field of growth mindset itrelates to a specific set of experimentsthat really show that the specificfeedback we get meaning whether or notwe get feedback that is attached to ouridentity like a label like smart orgreat athlete or talented sends us downa very different path of performance inthe short and long runas compared to whether or not we receivefeedback that's based on effort meaningyou tried really hard or you really seemto apply yourself under conditions whereyou're getting the right answer overtime because you simply refuse to quitthose are two very Divergent sets offeedback and as you'll learn in a momentthe sorts of feedback that we getespecially early in life or early in anEndeavor so this doesn't just apply toyoung kids this applies to adults toowho are taking on a new skill or tryingto expand on an existing skill those twoDivergent forms of feedback getintegrated into our core beliefs aboutwhat we think is possible for us in agiven Endeavor and the great news is wecan also modify those core beliefssimply by changing the feedback that wegive ourselves the research paper I'dlike to discuss briefly that beautifullyembodies the runway that led to thediscovery of growth mindset is paperfrom Dr Carol dweck as well as hercolleague Claudia Mueller and the titleof the paper essentially says it all thetitle is praise for intelligence canundermine children's motivation andperformanceright that should be surprising thatpraise for intelligence can underminemotivation and performance I would havethought and I think many people probablybelieve that if you tell a child or anadult that they're really good atsomething and you're genuine about thatfeedback meaning they're performing welland you say great you're doing reallywell you're so smart you're so talentedthat their performance would continue toimprove that it would bolster theirmotivation to engage in that activitywhich hopefully they enjoy butregardless provided that it's a safeactivity it's educational or what haveyou that it would serve to encouragethem right the kid thinks not only am Iengaging in this activity but I'mgetting positive feedback presumablyfrom people that I care about or whoseopinion I care about wouldn't that serveto elevate performanceit does not in fact the exact oppositehappens so I'll just give you a few ofthe key takeaways from this studythe way it was done is very interestingthey essentially gave feedback aboutperformance that was linked up with achild's intelligence telling kid they'resmart they're talented that they canlearn things really easily or thatthey're very good at learning this sortof thing and they call that intelligencefeedbackor they gave them what was called effortfeedback the simple way to think abouteffort feedback is that it's moreattached to verbs as opposed to labelsso effort feedback consists of thingslikeyou tried really hard on that problem itwas great the way that you appliedeffort it was great the way that youpersisted it was great the way that evenwhen you got the wrong answer you spent10 minutes thinking about it and thenyou tried again and again or in somecases even if they didn't get the rightanswer telling them well even though youdidn't get the right answer it's reallyterrific that you continue to try Okayso intelligence feedback was the sort offeedback that was tied to labels ofidentity things like smart talented Etcwhereas effort feedback was tied toverbs choices behavioral and cognitivechoices that children made in an effortto learn or get better at something soin this study which included over 100children they either got theintelligence type feedback or the efforttype feedback or there was a controlgroup that didn't get either theintelligence or the effort type feedbackand then they looked at a number ofdifferent outcomes so I'll justhighlight a few examples of what theyfound first of all the kids that got theintelligence-based feedback when theywere then later offered problem setsthat were either challenging or were ofthe sort that they knew they couldperform well on they tended to selectproblems that they knew they couldperform well on these are what werereferred to as performance goals inother words they picked problems thatallowed them to continue to get thepraise that they had received previouslyabout being smart or talented whereasthe kids that got feedback about theirstrong effort when later presented withproblems that were either easy or hardmore often than not they picked theharder problems that stood to teach themmore so that's striking it says that ifyou tell a kid that they're smart ortalented and that's the reason why theyperform wellwhen they encounter challenges they arelikely to go with the least amount ofchallenge so that they can continue toreceive that praise or feedback whereasif you receive praise and feedback foryour strong effort then later you tendto pick environments problem sets Etcthat allow you to exert the very effortthat got you the praise in the firstplace so in both cases these childrenare essentially attached to the praiseright in some sense I mean we like tothink that they enjoy these activitiesand they're benefiting from them as wellbut in both cases the praise reallyserves to reinforce a certain pattern ofbehavior but in the case of givingintelligence feedback the kids arereally just trying to reinforce beingtold that they're smarter talented asopposed to reinforcing the engagement inthe activity that got them the praise inthe first placeand the converse is also true when kidsare told hey you really tried hard andthat's great or I like how you persistedor you're so persistent I can really seehow persistent you are in trying to getthe right answer even if you don't getthe right answer well then when youpresent those kids with additionalchallenges they work very hard to stayin Challenge and guess what no surprisethe kids that are rewarded for effortand that continue to pick harderproblems outperform the kids that aregiven the intelligence praise andfeedback by a large margin so what doesthis tell us this tells us that thenarratives that we hear from others ofcourse reinforce certain patterns ofbehavior what else does this tell usthis tells us that if you're a parent orteacher you have to be very carefulabout giving feedback to a child that isattached to their identity around anendeavorespecially if they're performing well atthat endeavor right now of course if achild is not performing well atsomething you also don't want to tellthem that they're stupid right you don'twant to tell them that they're deficientright but that's a rare occurrence inthe classroom one would hope that's arare occurrence on the field one wouldhope but what's very common very verycommon is that when we see children oradults performing well we tend to givethem identity labels as a way to try andreinforce whatever Behavior we observeand we like now the other thing they"

            "text": "looked at in the study besides whetheror not these kids would pick hard oreasier challenges down the line wherethe actual raw performance on cognitiveproblems and these data I must say arejust so interestingthey took the kids and they gave themall the same problem sets and all thekids across the board whether or notthey were getting intelligence praise oreffort praise or they were in thecontrol group we're performing more orless the same way they were getting someof these questions right some of thesequestions wrongthen they gave them praise afterthey completed those problems theyeither got intelligence praise you're sosmart you're so talented or they goteffort praise you tried so hard youreally persisted that's fantastic thenlater they gave them another set ofproblems and they looked at performancenow remember the first time around allthe kids got some of the questions rightand some of the questions wrong sothere's room for improvement foreverybodywhat they found was absolutely strikingthe kids that were in the control groupso they didn't get any specific form ofPraise they perform more or less thesame way as they did before so if theywere getting 75 percent of the answersright the first time they got 75 percentof the answers right the second time 25wrong in both casesthe kids that were in the intelligencepraise group that you're so smart you'reso talented praise group theirperformance went down significantlywhereas the kids that were in the effortpraise group their performance increasedsignificantly okay so this is abi-directional effect where givingintelligence praise reduces performanceand giving effort praise improvesperformance which is absolutely strikingand tells you everything you need toknow which is if you're a parent you'rea teacher and of course as we all giveourselves feedbackrewarding yourself for effort is thebest way to improve performancerewarding yourself based on identitylabels so smart so talented you're agreat athlete Etc all that stare in themirror and do self-affirmation stuff canactually undermine performance and infact it does undermine performance itmay not do it right away but eventuallyit does and in a moment I'll explain whythe other thing this study looked atthat I just have to mention is thisnotion of persistence so rememberearlier I said that the kids that gotintelligence praise tended to pickeasier problems down the line whereasthe kids that got effort praise tendedto pick harder problems it turns outthat the kids that got intelligencepraise also tended to take on fewerproblems overall they tended to limitthe total number of challenges that theyengaged in whereas the kids that got theeffort praise that you worked so hardyou're so determined that was soimpressive how you just kept going evenwhen you got some answers wrong thosekids not only opted for harderchallenges they not only performedbetter but they also took on many morechallenges so these data really madeclear that the effort praise is the wayto go now I know many people have heardthis whole thing about don't reward theperson reward the effort reward theverbs as I'm referring to it but it'sactually pretty rare that we hear effortrewarded in everyday settings and it isvery common for us to overhearintelligence praise or Talent praise youknow a kid comes home with a trophy andwe tell them you're a great athleteright a kid comes home with a greatreport card you know you're so smartcongratulations a kid comes home withsome sort of win in their world and wetend to give them a label because welike to think that that label will getinternalized and they'll start to viewthemselves as a winner we tell them youcan do anything you're a winner you're awinner and of course you don't want totell children or yourself or any otheradult you're a loser right we do notwant to do that you don't want toundermine performance that way but it'svery clear based on This research and alot of other papers similar to it thatwe all have a giant blind spot sittingin our psychological field when we aregetting and receiving praise that reallyit is the sort of praise that's attachedto the very efforts that led to theresults that will lead to even improvedresults over time okay so this paper isreally truly important it's a landmarkpaper in the field of psychologymotivation learning and performance andthat's why I'm discussing it in suchdetail here but it actually includes oneadditional piece of information that Ialso think everyone should know aboutand that is the tendency for childrenwho get intelligence praiseto misrepresent their performance onsubsequent effortswhat do I mean by that basically whatI'm saying is in this paper they had thechildren perform on a given task andthen they either got intelligence praiseyou're so smart you're so talented oreffort praise you worked so hard you'reso diligent you kept going even when youwere faced with results you didn't likeand then they had them do a series ofother tasks and then report theirresults to other kids and what theyfound is that children who getintelligence praise when they need toreport their scores either by walking upto the board and putting a little Markwhere their particular score is ortelling another student what their scorewas or even writing it down on a pieceof paper covertly so that's not visiblybeing compared to all the other scoresthe kids that got intelligence praisetend to lie about their scoreand as you could imagine they tend tolie in the direction of makingthemselves appear as having performedbetter than they actually did so this isa pretty Sinister aspect of intelligencepraise that we don't often hear abouteven if you've heard telling a personthat they are smart or talented canultimately undermine performance rarelyif ever do we hear that telling someonethat they're smart or talentedcan increase the probability that thatperson is going to misrepresent theirperformance in the future and that'strue regardless of whether or not theyperform pretty well or not in the past Imean you could imagine that the kidsthat were told that they wereintelligent that they're talented thatthose kids you know if they were doingwell and then suddenly did poorly thatthey Slide the score up a little bit wedon't want anyone to do that but you canimagine how a young kid might do that tokind of preserve their ego but no insome cases these kids are alreadyperforming pretty well they're notgetting 100 but they're performing inthe top bracket and yet if they receivedintelligence praise they're still morelikely to lie about their performanceincreasing it further still whereas thekids that receive the effort praise dono such thing they Faithfully representtheir performance and as I mentionedbefore for many reasons that we'll talkabout in a few minutes meaning themechanisms and what's really going on inthe heads of these kids that get effortpraise they're performing better thaneverybody else so just to illustrate howimportant the findings in the study"

mention earlier but Ishould have is that if we receive thoselabels of being a high performer smarttalented Etc either before or aftera given task or game or examit still has a detrimental effect inboth cases meaning you tell someoneheading into something you're a greatathlete you are so smart you're going todo so well on this exam you underminetheir performance or if they take theexam and afterwards before you see theirscores or even after they score let'ssay they get an A plus they geteverything perfect and you say you areso smart you are so talented you areundermining the performance on the nextexam that's how striking these resultsare and again they've been shown againand again in different populations ofstudents and adults conversely it'sstriking how powerful the effort labelscan be at improving performanceconversely and fortunately the same istrue for effort-based praise so ifbefore a kid or adult heads into acompetition or exam or preparation for acompetition and exam you say you knowwhat I know you to be a really dedicatedworker you really persist you know howto do hard things you really dig yourheels when it gets hard and you overcomechallenges if you do that before thatchild or adult heads into challenge theywill perform better and if after an examor performance or practice whatever theeffort happens to be you tell them youreally worked hard I love the way thateven when you know you got kicked in theshin and you're limping along there andyou're hurt you continue to play or evenwhen you know everyone else went tosleep and you continue to study althoughby the way I do encourage people to getenough sleep there are times in whichlet's face it the person who stays uplatest studying provides they get enoughsleepthey're getting the extra hours in rightI might have been that kid in college ortried to be that kid in collegeif you reward effort after the effortyou also set the mind the brain of thatchild or adult up to provide more effortto future endeavors so it's very clearit doesn't matter if the timing of thepraise comes before or after a givenbout of effort or performance you giveidentity praise before performancediminishes you give identity praiseaftersubsequent performance diminishes yougive effort praise before performancegoes up you give effort praise afterperformance goes up so I know I sound alittle bit like a broken record but wehear so often about growth mindset aboutgiving the right form of Praise but it'snot often that we are told when to givethat praise and the short answer ofcourse is doesn't matter in fact weshould always be striving to give othersand ourselves praise that is correctlyattached to genuine effort and that wordcorrectly is important here I'm notsaying you know take a kid who performedpoorly on an exam because they kind ofloafed or the kid that was justshuffling their feet out on the soccerfield and say hey great you know you youworked so hard when they didn't you knowwe know when we're being lied to or whenwe're lying to ourselvesbut that should give you a sense ofcontrol not a sense of lack of controlbecause ultimately effort is somethingthat we can control in fact whenever Ihear the term control what you cancontrol I get a little bit nauseated anda little bit irritated too because it'snever clear what people are referring towhen they say control what you cancontrol focus on what you can controlwhat's the thing that we all really cancontrol it's our level of persistenceand our level of effort and of course weall have different circumstances suchthat persistence and effort can beharder in certain circumstances and forcertain people certainly but at the endof the day at the end of the year and atthe end of our life really the onlything that you really truly can controlis where you place your attention andwhere you place your effort those arethe two things that are really inherentto you and your nervous system no onecan do the effort for us no one candirect our attention for usthings and people can try and divert ordistract our attention and our effortbut ultimately effort and attention thatis intrinsic motivation come as the namesuggests directly from us okay so it'sclear that we have a striking set ofresults in the literature and againmajor hat tip to Carol dweck and hercolleagues for making this discoveryright it is what eventually led to thediscovery of growth mindset and it'swhat we're really building up to hereokay so this early work from dweck andcolleagues and by early I mean late 90srightis really spectacular it reallytransformed the way that we think abouteducation and learning in general and infact neuroplasticity but what it didn'tanswer is why you know why is it thateffort praise leads to betterperformance and intelligence praiseidentity praise leads to diminishedperformance and it turns out that theanswer resides in how people respond toerrors how they respond to feedback thatthey did not want and there's a reallynice study that looked at thismechanistically in the brain to askwhat's going on under the hood meaningwithin the brain when people who haveone mindset or anotheradopt a growth mindset that is the ideathat if they engage in effort that theycan get better at things or if they havewhat's called a fixed mindset this ideathat if they're not performing well itmust be because they just simply can'tperform well they don't have thecapacity or the ability to perform wellso the study I'm referring to is a studyfirst author mangles last author nosurprise Carol dweck and it's entitledwhy do beliefs about intelligenceinfluence learning success a socialcognitive Neuroscience modelI'm not going to go into all the detailsof the study but the study used what'scalled erps event related potentialsevent related potentialsare measured by putting a cap on theskull that has a bunch of electrodes butthey don't penetrate the skull they'repicking up electrical potentials thatcorrelate with shifts in brain activitynow an advantage of erps is that it'spretty non-invasive you can even do iton babies you don't have to cut into theskull you don't have to remove any skinas you would if you were going to youknow put electrodes down into the brainwhich essentially is neurosurgery andit's not as disruptive as being put intoa functional magnetic Imaging machinewhere you're put into a tube and youhave to lie motionless for an hour ormore actually it was in an MRI machinenot for any clinical reason but just asa diagnostic scan recently and nowadaysthey allow you to watch Netflix in thereor do something but you have to stayvery very still so it's hard for a lotof people to do that but it can be doneif you need it to be done you do it buterps are great because people can comeinto the laboratory put on this skullcap it's got this funny thing or itlooks funny with all these little wirescoming out of it and you can get afairly good measure ofGlobal levels of activity across thebrain you can't really pinpoint finestructures and you can't look at brainactivity deep in the brain that'sprobably the major drawback of lookingat these erps but you can see globalshifts in activity across the brain andthe other Advantage is you can do thatwhile people are engaging a lot ofdifferent types of tasks you can movearound a lot whereas when you're in anMRI machine you're in that little tubeyou can't really do much so this studyhad people equipped with these skullcaps looks like a kind of like a hoodiewith a bunch of wires coming out of itand they had themplay a game basically what they did isthey were asked questions these aretrivia type questions like what's thecapital of Australia Australians you'renot allowed to answer that question buteveryone else should try and then hereI'm paraphrasing people indicate theirconfidence in how accurate they werewith the response okay so they ask thema question like what's the capital ofAustralia the person would answer andthen they say how confident are you on ascale of say one to tenthat you got the answer correct and thenthey were given two pieces of feedbackand the first piece of feedback providedinformation only about their responseaccuracy were they right or were theynot rightand then the second feedback was theygot the correct answer so this is apretty clever experimental designbecause it allowed the researchers tolook at people's thinking as they'retrying to get the right answer thencompare that to how confident they werethat they had the right answer right youcould imagine that if someone was reallyconfident like if you ask me what's yourname and I say Andrew what's myconfidence that my name is Andrew 75just kidding 100 okay 100 whereas if youasked meum I was confronted this the other dayuh in your physics class when theytalked about the right hand rule whichis if you're listening don't don't worryabout it it's just when you put out yourindex finger your middle finger and yourthumb with your right hand in the righthand rule is the magnetic field the themiddle finger the index finger the thumband I'm pretty sure that it's prettysure that it's the the magnetic field isthe the middle finger that's the vectorof the middle finger but how confidentam I in this result I don't know maybe50 because it's been a while since I'velooked at this stuff and I should knowthis but I haven't looked at so 50 whenyou give people these kinds of questionswhile recording brain activity you'regetting a lot of information you'relooking at accuracy you're also lookingat confidence you're looking at lack ofconfidence and you can correlate thatwith different patterns of brainactivity now they had essentially twogroups of people in the study one grouphad an intelligence mindset theybelieved intelligence was more or lessfixed the other had what we call agrowth mindset they believed thatthrough effort that intelligence wasmalleable that people could learn newinformation including themselves theycould learn new informationand you wouldn't necessarily think thatthese two groups would show differentpatterns of brain activity in responseto getting things right or wrong whiletheir brain was being imaged but in factthat's exactly what happened there's acertain waveform of activity the nameisn't really important you call it theP3 wave in these Erp experiments P3 waveis a certain pattern of activity thatemerged during the presentation to thesubject that they gotten something wrongso the P3 wave it's just a littleblippin neural activity in the braincorrelated with when people were toldnope you got that one wrong okay andwhat was really interesting is that theheight of the P3 this let's just call itan error signal because it correlatedwith the error signal this nope you gotit wrong signal in the brain that signalwas larger in people with a fixedmindset as opposed to in people with thegrowth mindsetnow what was especially interesting isthat the location of that activity wasabove a brain area called the interiorcingulate cortex the ACC the anteriorcingulate cortex is a structure involvedin many different functions in the brainbut one of its primary functions is thatin the front of the ACC what we call therostral or anterior ACCivity there tends to correlate withemotional responses it tends tocorrelate with our internal senseso-called enteroception whereas in thedorsal ACC meaning the top of the ACCactivity there tends to correlate withcognitive information and cognitiveappraisal meaning this structure has alot of different functions but it's gota little area within it that tends to bemore related to our emotional or somaticresponses to things and it's got anotherarea inside of it the tends to be morerelated to our thinking our cognitionand what was really interesting is thatin the group that had the fixed mindsetwhen they were told that they gotsomething wrong there tended to be agreater signal in that rostral oranterior ACC meaning they had a biggeremotional response to it or at least theneural activity suggested that whereaspeople with a growth mindset whenpresented with ah you got somethingwrong the error signal the error signalwithin their brain tended to reside oreven to shift toward areas that areassociated with cognitive appraisal andso the conclusion of this study as wellas other studies using functionalmagnetic resonance imaging that havelooked at similar tasks is that whenpeople have a growth mindset and theyare presented with the information thatthey got something wrong rather thanjust feel it as a somatic response or anemotional response they tend to appraiseit they tend to direct their attentionalresources toward trying to understandwhat the error was and why they got thaterror and this I believe is absolutelyfundamental to understanding thedistinction between a fixed mindset anda growth mindset because perhaps you'veseen these lists these you knowside-by-side lists that you know a fixedmindset versus a growth mindset you knowa fixed mindset is one in which you'retrying to look smart that you're not sofocused on effort that your response tosetbacks is to give up you know and youracademic and other forms of performancetends to be low whereas in a growthmindset your goal tends to be to learnyou tend to Value effort more you tendto respond to setbacks by working harderand your performance is higher and I'mnot trying to make light of these liststhese lists are important because theyhelp us organize our information anddifferentiate between a fixed versusgrowth mindset but they don't tell uswhy focusing on effort and engaging moreeffort would actually translate intohigher performance for instance youcould imagine a scenario where the exactopposite is true right we can make up ajust so story where if your identity isso rigidly fixed to high performanceyou're likely to outwork everybody rightthat seems like a logical conclusion aswell but that's not the way it plays outit's when your identity is attached toyourself sense of ability to engage inongoing effort especially when youreceive signals that you're gettingthings wrong or not performing well thatis tied to elevated performance in thestudy using erps tells us that's likelyto be the case because of how people whohave a growth mindset Focus theirattention when they're told nope you gotthat wrong or when people think they gotsomething right right they give ananswer and they say what's yourconfidence level and they say 90 maybe99 maybe even 100 percent it's wrongpeople who have a fixed mindsetfocus on the emotional response to thatmore of their brain resources aredevoted to I got it wrong I thought Igot it right then the people who have agrowth mindset who are thinking waitokay then what was that answer and howcould I possibly get that answer wrongI'm going to figure that out okay now asyou're hearing this you're probably"

ofunderstanding of how to implement itturns out to be necessary but notsufficient there's an additional piecethat we need to accomplish the good newsis that additional piece is verystraightforward to understand if we zoomout and we start to really understandthat growth mindset is really a way ofconnecting motivation to cognition it'staking this thing that we callmotivation which is of course what weall want we all want to be motivated weall want to be effort driven Etcand we take motivation and we tie it toa set of specific thoughts or thoughtprocesses that we can controlthat is Far and Away different thanlooking at motivation simply as anemotional or an internal state of quoteunquote feeling motivated and in factthat's what most people including myselfdefault to we want to feel motivated sofortunately we try and get good sleepwhich is essential that really helps fordaytime mood focus and alertness andthereby motivation we hydrate weexercise we might even drink caffeine asa way to increase our level of alertnessand motivation and all of that isfinding good in fact all of that isencouraged although I would say that thecaffeine part is optional but all thoseother things are encouraged towardmental health physical health andperformance and motivation but whatgrowth mindset is really about is it'staking this thing that we callmotivation and it's saying okay what arethe specific types of thoughts andactually the specific thoughts thespecific cognitive processes that willallow us to feel more motivatedespecially under conditions where wefeel something is hard where we are notgetting the results we want and in orderto master that process we need toembrace another mindset that's right inorder to access growth mindset it's veryclear that we need to be able to thinkabout errors and we need to overcomeerrors and we need to devote ourattention to errors and we need todevote our attention to reframing what'sgoing on in our head when we're feelingnot motivated Etc and all of that isreally hard to do from a purelypsychological standpoint but there'sthis additional mindset which has to dowith our mindset around stress andfrustration itself that can allow us toaccess growth mindset far more easilyand this mindset around stress actuallyhas a name it's called the stress isenhancing mindset and there's a verystraightforward way to increase yourstress is enhancing mindset so first Iwant to step back and acknowledge theperson who really made some of the keyfundamental discoveries in this areathat we call stresses enhancing mindsetsand that's Dr Alia sometimes referred toas Dr Ali Crum she's a tenured professorof psychology at Stanford she also is aformer division one athlete and alicensed clinical psychologist she's anabsolute Phenom and I promise you thatshe is so successful in all thosecategories by way of immense amounts ofeffort in addition to that she alsohappens to be an incredibly kind personand generous person she was a guest onthis podcast previously you can findthat episode in the show note captionsor by going to hubermanlab.com andsimply searching for mindset crumbc-r-u-mher personal story and her work and thetool she offers are absolutelyspectacular however you don't need to goto that episode just yet I'm going totalk about some of those tools now andI'm going to talk about how using thosetools can allow you to access growthmindset and then I'm going to talk abouthow the combination of applying a stressis enhancing mindset with a growthmindset acts synergistically to evenfurther improve performance in the shortand long run the stresses enhancingmindset is the outgrowth of manydifferent studies and not just from DrAli Crum but from others as well but forthe time being I want to focus on onepaper in which Dr Crum was the firstauthor so this work was done before shearrived at Stanford the paper isentitled rethinking stress the role ofmindsets in determining the stressresponse and the key takeaway from thispaper is that how we think about stressimpacts how we react to stress so muchso in fact that what this paperillustrates is that if people are giveneven just a short tutorial about some ofthe negative consequences of stress onlearning and performance and theirphysiology and their health theyexperience a lot of negativeconsequences of stress when they are putinto a stressful circumstanceconversely if people are taught aboutthe performance enhancing aspects ofstress then those people will experienceperformance enhancement when they areconfronted with stress in a learning orother performance type environment sowhat we are talking about here is notthe placebo effect I want to be veryclear about thatwe are also not talking about lying topeople in order to shift their responseto stress what we're talking about hereis two different conditions onecondition where people are exposed toinformation that is true about howstress can diminish performance andanother condition in which people areexposed to information that is also trueabout how stress can enhance performancenow you might be saying how can it betrue that stress is both performancediminishing and stress is performanceenhancing and ah therein lies the keytakeaway from this paper it depends onwhat you believe about stress in fact adifferent way to umbrella this wholediscussion is to say that how you thinkabout stress impacts the stress responsein profound ways so this paperrethinking stress the role of mindsetsand determining stressdid a very simple set of manipulationsthey had people in one group listen to alecture that effectively was titledquote the effects of stress are negativeand should be avoided and that lectureincluded information about how stressdiminishes performance and how it candiminish health and vitality learningand performance productivity itincreases uncertainty Etc okay and allof that information is truea separate group listened to a lectureentitled quote experiencing stressimproves health and vitality and againthat information is true now I realizethat some of you are probably stillasking how can it be that stressdiminishes health and performance andstress also enhances health andperformance and the answer lies in twothings one the level of stress andtherefore the level of hormones that arereleased in response to that stress theduration over which the stress responseoccurs but the key variable here is thatour cognitive understanding about whatstress does impacts whether or not ourphysiology goes down the direction ofdebilitating or enhancing effects ofstress Okay so we've got a conditionhere where people are being informedvery differently about what stress doesin one case it's the stresses badmessage in the other case it's thestress is good message and there aremany different experiments within thispaper but one of the more interestingones I believeis where they looked at work performanceboth in terms of performance of whatthey call soft tasks so these aresomewhat easier tasks as well as hardtasks and when you look at the groupthat was given information about howstress diminishes performance in thesoft tasks okay so the somewhat easytask You Don't See Much change in theirperformanceas you compare the before the learningabout stress is diminishing to after thelearning whereas the people who learnthat stress is enhancing actuallyexperience some improvement in workperformance even though the challengethat they're facing isn't that great soagain what this means is that learningthat stress can enhance performance byproviding people true information abouthow stress can enhance performance canincrease performance even in the contextof stuff that's not that hard not thatstressful even more interesting is thatwhen you look at performance on tasksthat are considered hard and you comparethe stresses diminishing group meaningthe group that was taught that stress isdiminishingand compare that to the stressesenhancing group you see a reallyDivergent response the people that learnthat stress diminishes performance didnot improve at all whereas the peoplethat learn that stress can enhanceperformance enhance their performancesignificantly now keep in mind all theyare doing is learning that stress canenhance their performance and thenthey're given the task and they'reperforming better so that's prettyspectacular right there's no trainingsession that they went and did theydidn't practice these items that theywere being tested on in between theyweren't given a bunch of you know drillsto do and they didn't take a lot of timeto do it they just heard a tutorialabout how stress can enhance performanceand that I believe is remarkable becausewhat it says is that our cognitiveappraisal about stress which we all aregoing to experience in life rightelevated heart rate narrowing a visualFocus you know shifting of blood awayfrom the periphery all of these thingsare characteristic features of thestress response that we learn especiallyin this day and age because it's talkedabout a lot in popular culture that ohyou know all of the these mechanismswere put into us in order for us to getaway from the saber-toothed tiger or theor the line that's trying to eat uslet's be fair the stress response isthere for a lot of reasons not justbecause of saber-toothed tigers andlions I mean that's kind of a story thatwe make up the stress response isinherent not just to us but to otherspecies as a way to mobilize us eitheraway from things or toward things rightwe need to have somewhat of a stressresponse in order to engage in adaptivechallenge yes it's true that hundredsand thousands of years ago thoseadaptive challenges probably involvedhunting but they probably involvedSocial Challenges as well do you thinkit was you know easy for cavemen andwomen to engage socially and you knowkind of settle out their romanticinteractions Etc do you think it waseasy for them to raise children no ofcourse not the stress response is therefor a variety of reasons not just to getaway from predators the really excitingthing that's been discovered in thecourse of Ali krum's work and other workin the last couple of decades is thatthe stress response is neither good norbad the stress response depends onwhether or not you believe thesensations that you're experiencingelevated heart rate narrowing a visualFocus Etc are serving to enhance yourperformance or diminish your performanceand this study really points to the factthat just learning that it can enhanceperformancecan enhance performance now I know anumber of you are probably saying wait"

evenreally want to call it a stress hormonebecause cortisol does so many otherthings as well and it's not bad you needcortisol believe me you want cortisolespecially released early in the day andin response to acute stressors what youdon't want is for cortisol to stayelevated for long long periods of timeand you especially don't want it tointerfere with your sleep okay so muchso that I think at times I wonderwhether or not our philosophy on stressshould be that stress is fantastic forusexcept when it interferes with our sleepright and when stress becomes terriblefor us is when it starts to bechronically elevated and especially whenit starts to inhibit our ability tosleep well enough and long enough okayso the point here is that when weEmbrace a stressous enhancing mindset weare able to have shorter durationrelease of cortisol we are also able toengage what's called increased strokevolume under conditions of stress thisgets a little bit technical but theamount of blood that your heart can pumpwith each beat turns out to be a keymetric of stress when we are verystressed even though we need to mobilizea lot of resources somewhatparadoxically our total stroke volumecan actually be reduced and we tend toshuttle blood and other resourcestowards the core of our body and towardsmajor Limbs and away from things likeour brain and our periphery so one ofthe key measures of how a stressresponse quote-unquote is going is howmuch peripheral blood flow there is andwhen we are more relaxed underconditions of stress there tends to bemore peripheral blood flow when we aremore anxious more panicked underconditions of stress peripheral bloodflow is lower and in a remarkable set ofexperimentsAli Crum and colleagues have shown thatwhen we are just taught that stress canbe enhancing and then we are placed intoa stressful environment either becausewe are imagining stress or we areexperiencing real stress and then ourphysiology is measuredwhat is observed is that the totalamount of blood that the heart can pumpwith each beat is actually increaseperipheral blood flow increases and ourability to maintain cognition to thinkclearly under conditions of stressincreases and again the onlymanipulation here is a tutorial abouthow stress can be enhancing which isessentially what I'm telling you rightnow in fact for those of you thatperhaps have heard stress reducestestosterone levels stress reducesestrogen levels Etc that's true it isalso True by the way that when you areinformed about how stress can beenhancing of performance it becomesanabolic that's right it actually canlead to deployment of androgens andestrogens things that many not allpeople desire to have increased orcertainly desire to not have diminishedbelow their normal Baseline so there's alot of false stories out there aboutstress not false because what you'rehearing is wrongbecause indeed chronic stresschronically elevated cortisol can reducetestosterone reduce estrogen diminishsleep diminish immunity Etcbut it is also true that stress underconditions where one believes thatstress can be enhancing can be anabolicit can be pro-testosterone pro-estrogenit can bepro-cortisol regulation in ways thatallow you to focus your cognition and soon and so forth now that's exciting butI do realize that for some people itmight be sufficiently vague to make youwonder well how do I know if I'm gettingthe right response from stress or thewrong response and the simple answerthere is the more that you can learnabout how stress can enhance performanceand the more that you place yourselfinto safe I want to underscore it safeyet stressful adaptive circumstancesthese are going to be circumstanceswhere you stand to learn or grow in somepositive way not circumstances where youstand to hurt yourself or others ofcoursethe more that you can place yourselfinto conditions of stress and then tocognitively just tell yourself ah thiselevated heart rate this um quaking ofmy hands this you know sweating Etc thisis my body mobilizing resources and themore that you can tell yourself thatthat's actually affording you anadvantage in being able to allocate yourattention to specific things maybe whyyou made an error and analyzing that ormaybe why you succeeded at something andthinking about the steps that led tothat success the more that you can linkthat back to the processes that aretaking you in the directions that you doand don't want to go and thinking aboutthem because indeed that's what stresscan allow you to dothe more that you are shifting your mindaway from thinking about just the rawuncomfortable sensations of stressyou're putting a cognitive appraisal ona physiological process you are thinkingabout stress in a way that is changingwhat that stress is doing and you'retaking your brain and body from anegative State just to put a little bitof subjective valence on it negativeright nobody wants to have the badstress response to a positive State andwhen you develop a stresses enhancingmindset you not only are going to feelmore comfortable under conditions ofstress but you're also developing theperfect tool to plug into the wholeprocess of building up your growthmindset in a way that allows those twothings growth mindset and stress isenhancing mindset to synergize and todramatically improve performance in theshort and long term and that's not justa statement that I'm making that's whatthe research tells us so let's take alook at that research so now I'd like toshift our discussion to some very recent"

            "text": "findings about growth mindset and howgrowth mindset combined with thestresses enhancing mindset canpowerfully change outcomes for thebetter and can do so in a huge varietyof real world contexts and the work thatI'm referring to is the work of a personnamed David Yeager Dr David Yeager is aprofessor at the University of TexasAustin he did his graduate work withCarol dweck at Stanford and he now hashis own laboratory in Austin and bothwhen he was a graduate student withCarol and in his own laboratory he'sbeen doing very impressive large-scalestudies meaning many thousands ofsubjects so that itself is important andusing subjects from diverse areas ruralurban Etc different levels of affluencelack of affluence and findingessentially that when students aretaught about a growth mindset what it ishow it's different than a fixed mindsetand when those same students are alsotaught about what a stress is enhancingmindset is and cultivating that againsimply through information tutorialwatching a video about growth mindsetwatching a video about stress isenhancingmindsets and thenconfronted with stressconfronted with Tess confronted withopportunities to embrace hard challengesor easier paths across the board theresults show up again and again asstudents who are taught about a growthmindset and are taught that stress isenhancing perform better now jaegeringcolleagues have shown that across a hugenumber of different experiments in factthere's a paper published quite recentlythis was about a year ago in July of2022 in the journal Nature so ApexJournal published as a full article inNature and Science and elsewhere theyhave letters and shorter formats likereports and then there are the Articleswhich correspond to major major findingsso they published The Following resultsas an article in nature in July of 2022the title of the paper is a synergisticmindsets intervention protectsadolescents from stress and what Iabsolutely love about this paper is thatit includes a lot of different kinds ofexperiments so for instancethey looked at high school students whosimply anticipated a stressful event andhad been instructed on growth mindset orstress's enhancing mindset or both orcontrolconditions where they weren't informedof those mindsets right It's alwaysimportant to have control experimentswhere you're getting the same amount ofinformation but it's not the sameinformation and what they found was thatanticipatory stress right the stressthat we feel in anticipation ofsomething that we think is going tohappen is reduced when we are educatedabout growth mindset and we are educatedabout a stress's enhancing mindset andthe basic takeaway from that experimentwas yes indeed being educated on what agrowth mindset is and how it differsfrom a fixed mindset which you now havebeen educated ondefinitely buffers you against stress inaddition being educated on how stresscan enhance performance can buffer youagainst anticipatory stressbut it is clearly the case that when oneis educated on both of those thingsgrowth mindset and stresses enhancingmindsets that one observes the greatestbuffering or offset of the stressresponse in ways that can improveperformance now that is but oneexperiment of the six yes sixexperiments included in this singlePaper now I'm not going to go througheach of those six experiments in detailand just as a side note I've invited DrDavid Yeager to be a guest on thispodcast and he has agreed so when he's aguest on this podcast I'm sure he willdetail all the intricacies of thoseexperiments in order to inform us aboutexactly what was done and how so that wecan benefit from that information butjust by way of example anotherexperiment in this paperuse what was called the trigger socialstress test and the reason I'm going tohighlight this a little bit is because Ithink it relates to a lot of things thatmany of us have experienced and thatwill experience that are consideredstressful and of course we would alllike ways to buffer ourselves againststress and or leverage that stress toimprove our performanceas well as adopt a growth mindset so thetry our social stress test is a kind ofstandard mode of stressing people out inthe laboratory or in the classroom wherebasically a subject comes in you tellthem to wait a little bit of time thenyou measure their stress response atrest you're looking at their heart ratetheir blood pressure you might have themspit into a little tube and use thatsaliva to measure cortisol becausethat's how you measure cortisolthen you're going to tell them thatthey're going to prepare a speech forpresentation in front of a small groupof actual people then they actually haveto deliver that speech in front of thataudience during that speech sometimesthe people who are observing it aregiving feedback like frowns crossed armsEtcthen there's a pop quiz where they get ahard arithmetic test in front of thataudience and when they get answer iswrong they're told they're wrong infront of that audience this all mightseem kind of playful and silly to youbut most people do not experience thisas playful and silly almost everybodywho goes into one of these experimentsas a subjectfeel some level of stress especiallythose that don't like public speakingespecially those that don't seethemselves as very proficient inarithmetic or that don't like to workout problems in real time in front ofpeople you can see how this would bestressful and all the while measures ofpsychological and physiologicalreactivity are being measured peripheralblood flow the thing we talked aboutearlier among those what I justdescribed is pretty extensive but Iprovide all that as a backdropso that you can understand what happenedbefore which was people were simplyeducated on growth mindset how itdiffers from fixed mindset and or stressenhances performance mindset or notso basically what we have here is acondition in which people are justgetting information right there's nopill there's no treadmill there's nogoing home and doing a bunch of problemsets and what they observe in thisexperiment and all the other experimentscontained within this quite massivepaperis that the mere learning about growthmindset and stresses enhancing mindsetsallows these students to shift theirphysiologyso enhance peripheral blood flow changesin hormone secretion like cortisol nshifts in their psychology such thatwhen they feel stressed they start tosee that and experience that as anopportunity for Challenge and to leaninto that challenge and where they aretold that they got the wrong answerwhere they are told that they are notperforming well they are able to thinkabout that and to allocate their mentalresources such that they do start toperform better and the major takeawayfrom the study is that across the boardin all six experiments in Imagine stressin real stress laboratory stress actualclassroom stress and in embracing futurechallengesjust the learning about what stress canenhance your performance mindset isallowed students to do just that nowanother really interesting feature of"

            "text": "this study put out by Jager andcolleagues was that the interventionswere one time and relatively brief or wecould even say extremely brief whereas alot of previous experiments had lookedat growth mindset interventions thatwere on the order of you know four tosix to eight tutorials lasting anywherefrom 30 minutes to an hour each thisexperiment employed just one 30-minuteinterventionso when I heard about these results andread the paper I got very excited Iwanted to know what is this magicintervention exactly and I'm sure you'rethinking the same so I contacted DrYeager and he was gracious enough toprovide me some examples of what'scontained within this tutorial so that Icould give you those examples in realtime during this episode so basicallythe tutorial starts off with a questionabout stress it actually has a littlefield where you can fill in an answer tothe following questioncan you recall a time when youexperienced stress and what was thatstress related to and here I'mparaphrasing so what I put in responseto this because I actually filled outthe form itself was when I was a postdocwhich by the way is the four to six yearperiod of time that comes after your PhDtrainingI wrote when I was a postdocI was under a lot of competitivepressure to try and finish my projects Iwas working under a diminished incomemeaning I wasn't getting paid very muchrelative to the cost of living in thearea I lived at the time and I was alsosocially isolated from a lot of myfriends that previously I had lived veryclose to that was a stressful time thatI could recall in fact no other time inmy life as I recall was as stressful asbeing a postdoc which is not to say thatI didn't enjoy being a postdoc Idelighted in doing the science I did andbeing surrounded by the people I wassurrounded by but it was very verystressful for those and additionalreasons so that's how this tutorialstarts off and I believe that the reasonthat they asked that question at thebeginning of the tutorial is to kind ofcue up cognitive mechanisms thatsurround one's own understanding ofstress and then as you click through thetutorialit starts to explain of all thingsneuroscience and neuroplasticity it saysresearch from Neuroscience tells us thatthrough effort our brain can change itcan form new connections that we callsynapses so of course I was delighted tosee all that information I'm veryfamiliar with that type of informationIt also says things like and here I'mreading directly from the tutorialdifficulty struggle and frustration whenyou're learning something are not signsthat you've reached your limits they'resigns that you're expanding your limitsokay then you go to the next field andit sayslet's hear from a scientist Urietriceman is one of the top calculusprofessors here's what he tells usstudents on the first day of classquote everyone in this class willstruggle no matter who you are questionsare going to be flying at you that youcannot answer and when that happensyou're going to experience stress and ifyou don't understand that stress you'llthink it means oh no I don't belong herebut in fact that stress is an indicatorthat your understanding is deepeningit's not a sign that you're not learningit's a sign that you are learning okayso I could read this entire tutorial foryou but that would take up far too muchof our time but I think you get theessence of it which is that with eachslide within the tutorial you're beingtold that the thing that you'reexperiencing that could potentially feelnegative because it means negativethings you're not learning you'resuffering you're suffering health-wiseyou're suffering performance wiseis reappraised it's telling you no thefrustration the agitation the thoughtthat you're not capable and you're notcapable of getting better it's actuallythe opposite so what this tutorialreally is is it's an information basedtutorial it tells you something aboutthe brain's capacity to change it givesyou some True by the way mechanisticinformation about how synapses canchange and brain circuits can changebecause indeed they canand it's telling you that the negativesomatic bodily and cognitivethought-based experiences of stress thatthose represent you getting betterthat's simply what it is and despite itbeing simple in its specific messagethat message turns out to be incrediblypowerful how can we say that it's trulypowerful well we could turn toessentially any page in this study thatJaeger and colleagues did and see thatfor instance the intervention again thisis the combination of learning aboutgrowth mindset and learning that stresscan be performance enhancingled to 40 Improvement in self-regard soself-regard is something that can bemeasured we can have very negative orvery positive self-regard 40improvements in self-regard there was a14 Improvement in passing of coursesthat were of the particularlychallenging type and there was also asignificant Improvement in passing ofcourses that were less challenging inaddition to that people who watched andengaged in this 30 minute tutorial alsotook on additional hard challenges inthe future long after the interventionhad ceased now there are a number ofother features of the David Yeager work"
