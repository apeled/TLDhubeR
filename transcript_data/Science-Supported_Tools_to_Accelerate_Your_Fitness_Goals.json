            "text": "ANDREW HUBERMAN: Welcome\nto the Huberman Lab podcastwhere we discuss science\nand science-based toolsfor everyday life.[MUSIC PLAYING]I'm Andrew Huberman,\nand I'm a professorof neurobiology\nand ophthalmologyat Stanford School of Medicine.Today we are discussing ways\nto improve your fitness.In particular we are\ngoing to discuss toolsthat you can incorporate\ninto your existing fitnessroutine that will\nallow you to makesignificant improvement\nwithout havingto invest a lot of extra time.Most all of the tools we\nare going to discuss todaywere gleaned from the\n6 episodes that wedid with Dr. Andy Galpin.We provide a link to those\nfull episodes in the show notecaptions, of course.Now, those episodes\nincluded a very large numberof protocols, everything from\nhow to build a fitness, routinehow to enhance recovery,\nnutrition and supplementation,exercises and routines\naimed specificallyat strength or\nhypertrophy or enduranceor building anaerobic capacity.What I've done is to select key\nprotocols from those episodesthat I myself have\nstarted to incorporateinto my existing fitness\nroutine and that Ithink will be especially\nbeneficial and frankly funfor you to incorporate\ninto your fitness routine.Now, a little bit\nlater in this episode,I review the key components\nof any fitness program, thatis the number and type of\ncardiovascular trainingsessions and resistance\ntraining sessionsthat are essential for\neveryone to includeas a template or a foundation\nfor their overall fitnessprogram.Now, a little bit\nlater in the episode,I will be sure to\nreview what arethe essential components\nof any fitness program,so the number and type of\nresistance training sessions,the number and type of\ncardiovascular trainingsessions, as well as\nsome of the elementsof how those are\narranged to ensureproper and adequate\nrecovery between sessionsso that you can continue\nto make ongoing progress.However, the bulk of\ntoday's discussionis going to focus on tools\nthat you can use again veryeasily, very quickly, in\nsome cases even saving youtime during your\nfitness regimen in orderto improve all aspects of\nyour fitness, your endurance,your muscular endurance,\nyour anaerobic capacity,your recovery, your\nstrength, your hypertrophy.And in describing these tools\nto improve your fitness,it also provides an opportunity\nfor each and all of usto step back from our\nexisting fitness routineand ask whether or not\nit's really checking offall the boxes that\nare necessary,as well as where we can be\nmore economical with our timeand our efforts\nin order to reachour specific goals related\nto exercise and performance.So by the end of\ntoday's episode,you can be sure that\nyou have at least oneand as many as 12 tools\nthat you can incorporateinto your existing\nfitness routine,again, without adding much\nadditional time or effort thatare sure to accelerates\nyour progress.Before we begin, I'd\nlike to emphasizethat this podcast is separate\nfrom my teaching and research"

            "text": "roles at Stanford.It is however part of\nmy desire and effortto bring zero cost to\nconsumer informationabout science and\nscience-related toolsto the general public.In keeping with\nthat theme, I'd liketo thank the sponsors\nof today's podcast.Our first sponsor is LMNT.LMNT is an electrolyte drink\nthat has everything you needand nothing you\ndon't, that meansplenty of salt, sodium,\nmagnesium, and potassium,the electrolytes, but no sugar.Having adequate\nelectrolytes is absolutelycritical to cellular function,\nin particular the functionof neurons.In order for your neurons\nto function properlyyou need electrolytes\nin your system,and you need to\nbe well hydrated.There's a lot of research\nto support the factthat if you are even mildly\ndehydrated, that your cognitionsuffers, your physical\nperformance suffers,and your sleep can also suffer.So getting adequate electrolytes\nand hydration is key,and element allows\nyou to do that.I typically mix LMNT into\n16 to 32 ounces of waterand drink that first\nthing in the morning.I'll also drink another\none during exercise,and sometimes another one after\nexercise as well, especiallyif I've been sweating a lot,\nor it's a particularly hot day.If you'd like to try\nelement, you can goto drinklmnt.com/huberman,\nand that's spelledL-M-N-T.com/huberman.And you can claim a free\nsample pack with your purchase.Again, that's drinklmnt,\nL-M-N-T.com/huberman to claima free sample pack.Today's episode is also\nbrought to us by Helix Sleep.Helix Sleep makes\nmattresses and pillowsthat are of the absolute\nhighest quality.I've talked many times\nbefore on this podcastabout the fact that\nsleep is the foundationof mental health, physical\nhealth, and performance.And I say that because\nwhen we are notsleeping well or enough,\nall of those things suffer.Conversely, when we are sleeping\nwell and we're sleeping enough,all of those things improve.One of the key elements to\ngetting a great night's sleepis to have the proper mattress.Helix mattresses are different\nbecause they are customizedto your unique sleep needs.So if you go to their website\nand take a brief 2-minute quiz,they will match you\nto a mattress that'sideal for your sleep needs.The quiz asks questions\nsuch as do yousleep on your back, your\nside, or your stomach?Perhaps you don't\nknow, that's fine too.Or do you tend to run hot\nor cold during the night?Things of that sort that\nallow them to match youto a mattress that will give\nyou the best possible night'ssleep.I started sleeping on a Helix\nmattress a few years agoand it has vastly\nimproved my sleep.If you're interested in\nupgrading your mattress,you can go to\nhelixsleep.com/huberman to takethat 2-minute sleep quiz,\nand they'll match youto a customized mattress.You can also get up to $350\noff any mattress order and twofree pillows.Again if you're\ninterested, you can goto helixsleep.com/hurberman\nfor up to $350 off and two freepillows."

            "text": "Let's talk about tools\nto improve your fitness.Before we do that,\nhowever, I justwant to briefly\nremind everybody whatconstitutes a core or a\nfoundational fitness program.Now, what I'm about\nto describe is notfor the athlete that's\ntrying to just improveone aspect of fitness\nor sports performance.So for instance, if\nyou are a powerlifterand your main goal is\nto move more weighton the core\npowerlifting movements,or if you are somebody\ntraining for a marathon,it's likely that\nyour core fitnessprogram will differ\nsubstantially from whatI'm about to describe.However, the vast\nmajority of youare almost certainly\ntrying to have some levelof cardiovascular fitness.So the ability perhaps\nto run a mile or more,certainly to be able to\nwalk up a flight of stairswithout getting winded,\nyou almost certainly wantsome degree of\nstrength, the abilityto perhaps pick up a\nheavy load of groceriesand carry it in one arm\nas you carry somethingelse in the other arm.You want the ability\nto help move furniture.You want the ability certainly\nto not injure yourselfwhen performing daily\ntasks, and perhapsyou also want to be able\nto go out and play a pickupgame of basketball or\nsoccer, or to go outon a long hike with a family\nwithout feeling so sorethat you have to rest\nin bed the next day.An optimal fitness\nprogram of the sortthat was covered in the optimal\nfitness protocols episodethat I did is therefore one\nthat checks off the major boxesthat science tells us are\nimportant for health spanand for lifespan,\nand that can alsohelp us improve various\naspects of performance,and improve various\naspects of aesthetics,whether it's fat loss or\nmuscle growth, if we choose.So without going into that\nprogram in a lot of detail,the core elements\nof it are that itincludes at least 150\nminutes and ideallymore like 200 minutes per week\nof so-called zone 2 cardio.I'll talk a little\nbit more about zone2 cardio a little bit\nlater in the episode.But zone 2 cardio is for,\nthose of you that don't know,a type of\ncardiovascular exercisethat you can do\nwhile maintaininga conversation\nwithout getting windedbut that if you were to\npush a little bit harder,that you would find it hard\nto complete your sentences.In general, zone 2\ncardio is the sortthat you can do while purely\nnasal breathing, unless youneed to talk, of course,\nit's perfectly fineto talk while doing\nzone 2 cardio.And again the\nscientific researchtells us that we should all be\ngetting at least 150 minutesand probably more like 200\nminutes of zone 2 cardioper week.Now, in addition to that, a\nfoundational or optimal fitnessprogram for most people is\ngoing to include anywherefrom 2-4 cardiovascular\ntraining sessions thatare separate-- that's right--\nseparate from the zone 2cardio, as well as 2-4\nresistance or strengthtraining, sometimes also aimed\nat hypertrophy or muscle growthtraining sessions.Now, we have to acknowledge\nthat most people are probablynot going to hit the upper\nthreshold of all of those threethings.Most people simply do not have\nthe time and/or disciplineto get 200 minutes of zone\n2 cardio per week, plus fourresistance training\nsessions, plus fourcardiovascular training sessions\nthat are separate from the zone2 cardio.As a consequence, the\noptimal fitness programthat I described in that\nepisode, and by the way,it's the program\nthat I've essentiallyfollowed for the last\n30 years or more,includes three cardiovascular\ntraining sessions.So one of longer duration\nsort of typical endurance typetraining.This would be a long, slow\njog or a long hike oneday per week, as well as a\nshorter cardiovascular trainingsession of about 25 to 30\nminutes moving a bit faster,getting the heart\nrate up a bit more,breathing a little\nbit harder, as wellas one very short cardiovascular\ntraining session thatwould fall under the category\nof high-intensity intervaltraining, things like sprints,\nwhich don't necessarilyhave to be done running.Could be done on a rower.It could be done on\na bike, et cetera.So three cardiovascular\ntraining sessions, as well asthree resistance\ntraining sessions.I want to acknowledge that\nresistance training canbe done with body weight.It can be done with\nweights, with machines.I talked about the\ndiffering virtuesof one approach versus\nanother, but nonetheless,three resistance\ntraining sessions.One focusing specifically\non leg training.One focused specifically\non torso training.That's right, chest,\nshoulders, and back altogether,as well as some neck training\nfor important reasonsthat were mentioned\nin that episode.And then a third\nsession that wasaimed at somewhat smaller body\nparts, biceps, triceps, calves,and some other small body\nparts that tend to be neglectedand that are important to\ntrain if one wants to encouragemuscular balance both\naesthetically and structurallyto avoid injury and\nhave excellent posture.So those were the core elements\nof that foundational fitnessprogram.And I mentioned then\nand I'll mentionagain now that that\nprogram is not a mandate.It is not an absolute\nrequirement for anyoneto follow.It was simply meant as a\ntemplate from which peoplecould evaluate their own\nexisting fitness program,perhaps modify it\nsomewhat or a lot,or if you were interested in\ntrying that specific fitnessprogram, that you could do that.And we have provided a link\nboth to that episode in the shownote captions, but we've\nalso provided a linkto a table or chart\nthat describesthat foundational\nfitness program.It provides examples of\ndifferent cardiovasculartraining and resistance\ntype training sessions.And it describes some potential\nexercises and the rationalefor those exercises,\nand the rationalefor selecting particular\nrepetition rangesand rest between sets.All of that information is\navailable completely zero cost.You don't even need to\nsign up for anything.You simply go to the link that\nwe provided in the show notecaptions, and there's a\ndownloadable PDF therefor you to explore.Now, in addition\nto the solo episodethat I did about optimal\nfitness protocols,we did a six-episode\nguest serieswith Dr. Andy Galpin, who\nis a professor of physiologyat Cal State Fullerton\nand a world expertin all aspects of exercise\nand muscle physiology.That episode described\na lot of the science,and in particular\nscience-backed toolsfor improving everything\nfrom long-distance enduranceto anaerobic capacity, strength,\nhypertrophy, speed, power,recovery, nutrition,\nsupplementation, and waysto develop a year-long\nprogram that willensure you ongoing progress.In that series, Dr.\nAndy Galpin providedan enormous amount of valuable\ninformation, such that anyoneand everyone, meaning\nthe person who'sjust interested in\nstarting a fitness program,or improving their\nexisting fitness program,or the elite athlete who\nis interested in improvingtheir sprint times,\nor their jumpheight, or their powerlifting,\nor their marathon time,could clearly benefit from\nsome or all of the protocolsthat he described.Now, because that series is so\nextensive in terms of its depthand breadth, again, providing\nso much value at 0 cost thanksto Dr. Andy Galpin's\nexpertise, but at the same timebecause it might be a little\nbit intimidating for many peopleout there to try and figure out\nwhich protocols to incorporateinto their existing\nfitness regimen,I thought it would be fun\nand very beneficial to talkabout some of the key\ntools that were describedthroughout that\nseries that one couldconsider incorporating into\ntheir existing fitness routinenow.So that's what this\nepisode is really about.It's about the tools\nthat I personallygleaned from those\ndiscussions and that Ifound to be of tremendous\nvalue in improvingboth my cardiovascular\nfitness, my strengthand hypertrophy\ntraining, my recovery,and other aspects of my\noverall fitness protocols.And when I say\nbeneficial, I meanin terms of improving my\ncardiovascular fitness,improving my strength\nand hypertrophy training,and that have improved\nthe various metricsof fitness lifespan\nand health span whichinclude things like heart rate\nvariability, resting heartrate, blood pressure, VO2 max,\nas well as some of the fitnessmetrics that were described\nduring that episode serieswith Dr. Andy Galpin,\nsuch as performancemetrics, the ability to\njump a certain distance,the ability to run\na certain speedor to run a certain\ndistance at a given speed,the ability to move\nweights in good formfor a certain number\nof repetitions.Again, all of the metrics\nof performance and healthare going to vary tremendously\nfrom person to persondepending on where\nyou're starting,how long you've been\ntraining, and other aspectsof your health.The tools described\nin today's episodeare designed for everybody.Again, these are\nsimple tools that youcan put into your existing\nroutine that should reallymove the needle forward\nin terms of improvingyour overall levels\nof fitness and health.OK, let's talk about the\ntools to improve your fitness.The first tool is to\nmesh your zone 2 cardio"

            "text": "with your daily activities.So for those of you\nthat don't know,zone 2 cardio is\nthe type of movementthat we typically call\ncardio exercise thatelevates your heart\nrate somewhat,increases your\nbreathing somewhat,but that still allows\nyou to carry outa conversation without having\nto pause or to gasp in orderto complete your sentences.OK.So that's a general rule\nof thumb for zone 2 cardio.Now, for those of you that\nuse a fitness tracker,you can monitor whether or not\nyou are in zone 2 cardio veryprecisely.But if you're like me and you\ndon't use a fitness tracker,it's very easy to know if\nyou're in zone 2 cardiobecause again, it's that\nlevel of output that puts youright below or somewhat\nbelow the threshold whereif you were to exert yourself\nwith any more intensity,that you wouldn't be able\nto complete your sentences.Now, this could, of\ncourse, be evaluatedby jogging with someone or\nwalking with someone or hikingwith someone and carrying\nout a conversation.If somebody isn't available,\nyou could, of course,do this by trying\nto speak out loudand have a conversation\nwith yourself,or if you want another way\nto monitor whether or notyou're in zone 2 cardio\nwithout having to use a fitnesstracker, you could simply\nask yourself whether or notyou are maintaining a level\nof output that increasesyour heart rate\nand your breathingbut that allows you to\nmaintain purely nasal breathingthe entire time.Any of those approaches\nwill tell you more or lesswhether or not you're\nin zone 2 cardio.Now, the scientific data\ntell us that we should allbe getting anywhere from 150\nminutes to 200 minutes per weekminimum of zone 2 cardio for\nsake of cardiovascular health,cerebrovascular health, and\na number of other aspectsof health that are important\nessentially to everybodyfor health span and life spanNow, many people\nincluding myself, schedulezone 2 cardio into their\nweekly fitness regimen.So for me, I have\none day a week.For me it falls\non a Sunday whereI go out for a jog that lasts\nanywhere from 60 minutesto 90 minutes.It's a slow jog.I can maintain nasal\nbreathing the entire timeor have a conversation\nwith somebody elseor myself the entire\ntime if I like.Or sometimes it\nconsists of a hikeby myself or with other people,\nand sometimes those hikesextend anywhere from\nan hour to four hoursdepending on the\ncircumstances, et cetera.I will mention that\nwhenever possible, I tryand do that once a week zone\n2 cardio session out of doorsbecause I like being in nature,\nand I like getting sunlight,and I like getting fresh air.Now, during the discussion\nwith Dr. Andy Galpin,I explained how I\nget my zone 2 cardio.And I acknowledged that\nonce-a-week session doesn'talways allow me to\nreach that 150-minuteto 200-minute minimum threshold\nof zone 2 cardio per week.Sometimes it does,\nsometimes it doesn't.And his response to that\nwas very reassuring.What he said was, look, if you\nwant to schedule zone 2 cardioand head out for a long\nSunday jog or hike, terrific.If you want to schedule a zone\n2 cardio as two or more sessionson the treadmill or\non the bike, great.But that he doesn't\nactually think of zone 2cardio as exercise at all.And to that I gasped, and then\nI was a little bit deflated.I thought, oh, great.I've been doing all\nthis zone 2 cardio,and you don't even\nconsider that exercise.And then what he said\nwas very reassuring,and I think it's going to be\nvery reassuring to all of you.He said, first of\nall, zone 2 cardiois absolutely critical to our\nhealth for a number of reasonsthat I already mentioned.But in addition to that, zone\n2 cardio does not impede,and in fact, can enhance our\nother aspects of fitness.So for example, our\nstrength training,our hypertrophy training,\nor any type of speed work,or other types of cardiovascular\ntraining one might do.And that the best\nway to get zone2 cardio is OK, if you want\nto schedule it, schedule itas a session.But that to simply increase\nthe amount of walkingand in particular, walking at\na rapid pace that one does,and to increase the\ntotal amount of movementthat one's getting\nthroughout the week.So taking groceries in and\nout of the grocery store,running around with the kids,\ntaking a walk with a coworkerwhile having a work discussion,\ntaking your calls for workwhile pacing in the\noffice or going outside,what he impressed on me\nis that zone 2 cardiocan be meshed throughout\nthe daily activitiesthat I and everybody else\ngenerally have to do.And this was of great relief\nto me because I as many of youare, I'm extremely busy.I don't have time to schedule\nin more cardio per week,or at least I don't see\nthe way I could do thatwithout reducing the amount\nof sleep that I'm getting,or without reducing the\namount of social connectionthat I'm getting with family\nand friends, both of whichare extremely important to\nour mental health and physicalhealth.So the basic tool\nhere is yes, get200 minutes per week\nminimum of zone 2 cardio.And notice I said 200 minutes,\nnot 150 minutes to 200 minutes.I'm going to set\nthe higher thresholdof 200 minutes per week\nminimum of zone 2 cardio.But that you don't need\nto schedule that as timeon the treadmill.If you want to, great.But what was communicated to\nme from Dr. Andy Galpin isthat zone 2 cardio is\nimmensely beneficial,it's not going to\nimpede, and in fact, it'sgoing to improve other\naspects of fitness,and that it does not have\nto impede and it in factcan improve other\naspects of our daily lifelike our ability to engage\nsocially, our abilityto have a great output at\nwork in whatever type of workyou do.So the message is very simple,\nget 200 minutes or moreof zone 2 cardio per week.And the message is also\na very reassuring onewhich is that zone 2\ncardio can be spreadthroughout your\ndaily activities,and that if you're\ndoing enough of it,you probably don't even have to\ncount the total amount of zone2 cardio that you're getting.If you simply make the\neffort to move arounda lot more during\nyour daily activitiesand to mesh that zone 2 cardio\nwith your daily activities,you're going to hit\nthat threshold of 200minutes per week minimum.Now, that's a great\nmessage for mebecause I'm already doing\nthe three resistance trainingworkouts per week.I'm doing what now\nI can just callthe two other cardiovascular\ntraining workouts per weekbecause now I don't even count\nthat long Sunday jog or Sundayhike as exercise.I just consider that movement\nout of doors on the weekend.And in doing so, it's also\nallowed me to really enjoythat a lot more.There's something about\nconsidering somethinga fitness training program that\nshifts it from just recreationand enjoying life to training.And I, of course, love training.I love training in the gym, and\nI love training out of doors.I love running.I love lifting weights.I love all sorts of\nphysical training.I know many people do, I\nknow many people don't.But if one looks\nat zone 2 cardioas just part of\ntheir daily life,you're far more likely to get\nthat zone 2 cardio in and allthe benefits that come with it.And you're also opening up time\nfor work for social engagementsand to do and pay attention\nto other aspects of fitness,which is what we're\ngoing to talk about next.The second tool that I've\nincorporated into my fitness"

            "text": "regimen and that I believe\ncan be of great benefitto frankly everybody is to\nstart including low repetition,pure strength work.Now, some of you may already\nbe doing low repetition,pure strength work.But I believe that\nmost people don't.Most people who do\nresistance trainingare using either\nmachines, or free weights,or some combination of\nthose, or perhaps they'reusing body weight.And they tend to focus on\nrepetition ranges from about 5and usually more like\n6 repetitions outto about 10 and\nperhaps 15 repetitions.Now, of course, doing resistance\ntraining and repetitionranges of 5-15 reps\nper set, providedit's done at\nsufficient intensity,so either to failure or\nclose to failure, of course,in good form is\ntremendously beneficial.It can help build strength.It can enhance hypertrophy.There is tremendous value to\ntraining in those repetitionranges.But when I sat down\nwith Dr. Andy Galpinto discuss resistance\ntraining, specifically, hemade it very clear that\nat least for some portionof one's yearly training cycle.So perhaps eight weeks or\n10 weeks, or in the casethat I adopted 12 weeks,\nthere is tremendous benefitto training in the 3 to 5\nrepetition range and maybe evenlower.So the second tool of\ntraining specificallyfor strength in the 3\nto 5 repetition rangeis something that I started to\nincorporate after I sat downto record that series.And I'll just tell you\na few of the benefitsthat I've experienced,\nand then I'lltell you the specific\nprotocol thatmakes it very easy to do this.The most obvious benefit to me\nwas that I got much stronger.And that that strength\npersisted such thatwhen I went back to using\nhigher repetition ranges,so typically I train\nwith weights or machinesin the 6 to 10 repetition range,\nsometimes a little higher,sometimes a little lower.But never before\nhad I specificallytrained in the 3 to\n5 repetition rangeexclusively for a period\nof 10 to 12 weeks.And when I did that, I, of\ncourse, gained strength.But that strength\nstayed with me suchthat when I returned to\nhigher repetition ranges,I could use more weight in\ngood form, and that, of course,enhanced strength and\nhypertrophy further.In addition, there was another\neffect that was at least to mevery unexpected, which was\nthat my cardiovascular trainingimproved significantly.Now, why would this be?Because typically a\n3 to 5 repetition setdoes not elevate the\nheart rate for long enoughthat you would consider it\ncardiovascular training.And of course, the rest\nperiods between those setsis pretty long as well.So even if heart rate goes\nup during those heavy sets,it's going to go down during\nthose long 3 to 5 minute restperiods between those sets.But what I noticed was that my\noverall posture and my abilityto maintain\ncardiovascular outputwhile using good running\nform or good rowing formwas also vastly improved.And the logical interpretation\nof why that would beis simply that the\nmuscles got stronger,and those same muscles\nare being incorporatedinto the cardiovascular--\nlet's call it endurance workthat I'm doing on other days.And therefore, I can carry out\nthose cardiovascular trainingsessions in better form\nfor longer periods of time.I actually felt much stronger\nduring my cardiovasculartraining as I got much stronger\nmoving these heavier weightloads for low repetition sets.And then the third specific\nbenefit that I noticedis that when training heavy\nfor 3 to 5 repetitions per set,I didn't get sore.And this to me was\nan incredible benefitbecause typically when I\ntrain in the 6 repetitionto 15 repetition\nrange and I takethose sets to failure\nor near failure,I do experience some\nsoreness the next day.Ordinarily that soreness\nisn't so intensethat it prevents\nme from doing anyof the other sorts of\nworkouts that I do.And for those of you\nthat have visitedthat foundational\nfitness protocol,you know that I hit each major\nand minor muscle group onceper week directly as well\nas once per week indirectly.That's the overall\nstructure of that programin order to allow\nsufficient recoverybetween those resistance\ntraining workoutsto be able to make\ncontinual progress.Now, by training in this\n3 to 5 repetition rangethat Dr. Andy\nGalpin suggested, Iwas able to improve\nmy strength, improvemy cardiovascular\noutput, reduce soreness.I also just felt better overall.I had a lot more energy after\nthose workouts than I typicallydo after my resistance\ntraining sessionswhen I use higher\nrepetition ranges.There are just a number\nof different thingsthat made me feel, wow, this\nis really a powerful protocol.And of course, moving\nheavier weights in the gymfeels good too.It feels good to get stronger.At least there's a positive\nfeedback loop there for me,and I think for most people.And I should also mention\nthat for those of you thatare averse to doing heavier\nresistance training in the 3to 5 repetition range because\nyou fear that it will make youtoo big or too bulky, training\nin the low repetition rangesis actually more geared\ntowards increasing strengthand is shifting away somewhat\nfrom increasing hypertrophyor muscle size.So that's a great\nbenefit for those of youthat want to be\nstrong and also wantto maintain\ncardiovascular fitness,but you don't want\nto add muscular size.And of course, for all of you\nthat want to add muscular size,it's well established that\nincreasing your strengthwill allow you then\nto return to patternsof hypertrophy\ntraining that willallow you to use\nheavier weights,and therefore induce\ngreater hypertrophy.So there are oh, so many reasons\nto incorporate these strengthtraining protocols.So the way that Dr.\nAndy Galpin suggestedone do it and was the\nway that I did it is heused this 3 by 5 protocol.The 3 by 5 protocol is\nvery straightforward.It involves doing three to\nfive exercises per workout.OK.So if it's a workout for legs,\nit's three to five exercises.If it's a workout for\nsome upper body muscle,it's three to five exercises.Three to five exercises for\n3 to 5 sets per exercise,3 to 5 repetitions per\nset, and 3 to 5 minutesof rest between each set.In addition, he\nemphasized that onecan do those workouts three\nto five times per week.Although, I'm going\nto put an asterisknext to that last statement\nbecause I found that I couldn'tdo the 3 by 5\nprotocol say for legsspecifically three to\nfive times per week.I realize that might be\npossible for some people,but I'm somebody who like\nmany of you out there,either doesn't have the time\nor doesn't have the recoverycapacity to train my legs\nthree to five times per week.Even though I acknowledge\nthat there are probablyways to do that would\nstill allow me to recover,it just simply starts to impede\ninto other areas of training.It starts to impede other areas\nof life like work and familyand sleep and all the rest.So what I did and what\nI'm suggesting you tryis for any existing resistance\ntraining that you're doing,to take a period of 8 or\n10 or ideally 12 weeksand do the vast majority, if not\nall of that resistance trainingin the lower repetition range\nthat's designed specificallyto induce strength adaptations.And to not pay attention\nto whether or notyou're hitting that same muscle\ngroup three to five timesper week, rather if you\ntrain your legs once or twiceper week, to simply do all\nof the work for your legsin that 3 to 5 repetition range.If you train an upper body\nmuscle or muscle groups,chest, shoulders, back\nonce per week or twiceper week to just stay\nwithin that 3 to 5repetition range\nfor those work sets.Warm-ups can include\na few more reps.And then to adhere\nto this three to fiveexercises, 3 to 5\nsets per exercise,3 to 5 repetitions per set, and\n3 to 5 minutes between sets.Now, the one exception to\nthis that I incorporatedwas that for very\nsmall muscle groups.So for instance, the rear\ndeltoids or for neck work,or for calf work to not rely\npurely on 3 to 5 repetitionsbut maybe to work in\na range of anywherefrom 5 to 8 repetitions.So still fairly low\nrepetitions but not so lowthat it restricts you\nto 3 to 5 repetitions.The reason for that is that I\nand I think a lot of people outthere find it hard to\nfatigue those smaller musclegroups adequately with good\nform when restricting oneselfto those low repetitions.However, for big\ncompound movementslike presses and squats and\ndeadlifts and glute ham raisesand things of that sort, maybe\neven leg extensions and legcurls, which are isolation\nexercises, of course, to reallyrestrict oneself to those\n3 to 5 repetition rangesthat take you to\nfailure or near failure.I listed off the benefits of\ndoing that that I experienced,and I'm confident\nthat you will alsoexperience a lot of benefits.So just to remind you what\nsome of those benefits are,you get stronger,\nwhich feels great.That occurs within\nyour weight workouts,but it also carries over to your\nendurance training sessions.I also noticed\nthat when returningto higher repetitions\nfor resistance training,so after 12 weeks shifting away\nfrom 3 to 5 repetition rangesand going back to training\nin the 6 to 10 repetitionranges mainly.Occasionally up to 12 or 15\nbut really mainly restrictingto 6 to 10 repetitions that you\ncan move much heavier weightsin good form, and thereby\ninduce more hypertrophywhile still also continuing\nto gain some strength.And another benefit was\nagain reduced sorenesscompared to when training\nwith higher repetitionranges and more\nmental freshness,I guess the only\nway to describe it,when training in those\nlower repetition ranges.I don't know about\nyou, but when Ifinish a really hard\nhour-long resistance trainingsession done in the 6\nto 12 repetition range,there's a certain\ntype of mental fatiguethat even if I eat\nproperly afterwards,even if I hydrate\nproperly, that ittends to sap a bit of my\nmental energy later in the day.But that the training at\nthe 3 to 5 repetition rangedid just the opposite.It actually enhanced my\nfocus and my cognition,my overall levels\nof physical energy,which is great\nbecause it allows youto do all the other\nthings that we're requiredto do throughout the day.And by the way,\nit will also allowyou to get more of\nthat zone 2 cardio.So if you want more details\non the 3 by 5 protocol,again, that's time stamped\nin the relevant episodeon strength and hypertrophy that\nwe did with Dr. Andy Galpin.I'll also provide a link to that\nspecific time stamp in the shownote caption to this episode.I do want to point out that\nyou don't just jump rightinto heavy sets of\n3 to 5 repetitions,you need to warm up adequately.For some people that warm-up\nwill be higher repetition sets,so say 10 to 12 repetitions\nwith just the empty baror a lightweight.And then adding a\nlittle bit of weightand doing 8 repetitions\nand maybe 6 repetitions,and then your work\nsets as they'recalled of 3 to 5 repetitions.Or perhaps you're\nlike me and youprefer to do low\nrepetition warm-ups.So this was also something\nthat I discussed with Dr. AndyGalpin and that for me has made\na tremendous positive impacton all my resistance training,\nregardless of whether or notit is low repetition\nor high repetition.And that's to do a brief\nwarm set that is somewherein the range of 6\nto 8 repetitions,very light just to get\nfamiliar with the movement.Then to do a second\nwarm-up set thatincludes some load on the bar or\nthe free weight or the machine.And then a second warm-up set--again, this could be\nfree weights or machinesthat incorporates\na bit more loadbut still keeps the repetitions\nlow so in the 4 to 6repetition range.And then maybe,\nespecially if it'sat the beginning of the workout\nand my core body temperatureisn't elevated yet,\nI'll do a third warm-up.But that third warm up\nwhich, of course, isgoing to be progressively\na little bit heavierthan the first or\nsecond warm-up,is still going to fall within\nthe low repetition rangeso just 2 to 4 repetitions.For me, including a\nfew more warm-up setswith progressively heavier\nweight on each warmup but still keeping the\ntotal repetition countlow, so somewhere in the\nrange of 2 to 6 repetitions,has been very beneficial\nfor improving my workoutput during the so-called\nwork sets regardless ofwhether or not I'm training\nin the 3 to 5 repetition rangeor whether or not I'm\ntraining in the 6 to 15repetition range.I know for some people, this\nmight be kind of surprising,how is it that my work sets\nare actually higher repetitionthan my warm-up sets?Or put differently,\nhow and why is itthat my warm-up sets are lower\nrepetition than my work sets?And that's because I fall\ninto this category of peoplethat tends to fatigue\npretty quickly whendoing resistance training.So for me, keeping\nthe repetition counton any individual\nwarm up set pretty lowhas allowed me to really\nimprove my strength outputand really improve my\nstrength and hypertrophytraining when I shift to\nthe so-called work sets.So I already listed off a\nnumber of important documented"

            "text": "benefits and benefits\nthat I've certainlyexperienced by incorporating\nlow repetition,pure strength work into\nmy yearly training cyclefor periods of 8 to 12 weeks.In addition to that, during\nmy conversation with Dr. AndyGalpin, he said\nsomething very importantfor everyone to\nhear and understand.He said, when you look at the\ndata on aging and performance,in particular\nmuscular performance,you see some very interesting\npatterns within the data.He said for instance, that\nfor every year after age 40,there's a 1% drop in\nmuscle size that can beoffset by resistance training.But that if you don't\ndo resistance training,that you won't offset.And during that\nseries, we also talkedabout the minimum\nrequirement for 6and probably more\nlike 10 working setsper muscle group per week in\norder to at least maintainmuscle size, not just age\n40 and beyond but evenat younger ages.OK.So that's muscle size.1% decrease per year unless\nyou do the right thing.And the right thing is get 6\nto 10 working sets per weekin order to offset\nthat decrease.And if you train\nproperly for hypertrophy,yes, you can still increase\nmuscle size past age 40.In addition, he said\nthat there is a 3% to 5%reduction per year for every\nyear past age 40 in strengthand power.Now, that's a very\nimportant metricbecause what it's telling us is\nthat the drop off in strengthand power is significantly\ngreater per each yearafter age 40 than is the\ndecrease in muscle size,telling us that we\nhave to do somethingto offset that decrease\nin strength and power.In addition, he mentioned that\nfor every year past age 40,there is an 8% to 10% decrease\nin speed and in explosiveness.And so if one is interested\nin maintaining speedof muscular movement\nand explosivenessof muscular movement,\nsomething that's perhapsimportant to a number\nof you, one alsohas to incorporate training\nspecifically gearedtoward maintaining or improving\nspeed and explosiveness.Now, I like many people am\nnot so interested in speedand explosiveness, I know\nthey have their utility,but I am interested in\nmaintaining muscle sizeover the course of my life,\nperhaps even adding some muscleto a particular muscle groups.I'm also very interested in at\nleast maintaining and ideallyeven gaining some strength\nin certain muscle groupsthroughout my entire lifespan.And that's not just for\nperformance reasons.That's also because we know\nthat maintaining or improvingstrength of our muscles\nis very importantacross the entire\nlifespan but especiallyin the years spanning\nfrom 40 until death,which I think for most people\nfalls somewhere between 50,60, 70, or ideally, out into\nthe 80s and 90s or 100, right?That's what we're all seeking is\nto die later in better health.And in order to do that, we have\nto dedicate some very specifictraining protocols in order\nto maintain or build strength.So to summarize, in addition to\nall the positive reasons to dodedicated strength\ntraining that I mentionedbefore, it's highly recommended\nthat you do some dedicatedstrength training for the\npurposes of offsettingthe age-related decline in\nstrength that occurs again3% to 5% per year\npast age 40, which isa pretty significant decline.But the good news is\nif you do the 3 to 5protocol for say\n12 weeks per year,and then you continue\nto resistance trainusing other repetition ranges\ngeared towards hypertrophyand strength or perhaps\neven muscular endurance,the good news is you'll\nmaintain your strengthand perhaps even\nbuild your strength,offsetting that natural decrease\nthat would otherwise occur.I'd like to take a quick\nbreak and acknowledge"

            "text": "relates to your\ncardiovascular training,and it's a tool that\ncan greatly improveyour cardiovascular fitness\nwith a limited amount of timecommitment.But that is not\nto say it is easy.What I'm referring to is\nthe so-called Sugarcane.If you listened to the\nseries with Dr. Andy Galpin,you may recall our discussion\nabout the Sugarcane,which is so named after our\nfriend and expert trainer KennyKane.And it is a very efficient\nyet somewhat brutalway to increase your\ncardiovascular output.So the Sugarcane is\nthe type of protocolthat you would incorporate\nonce in the period of a weekbut certainly not every week.It's the kind of thing that you\nmight throw in once every twoweeks or once every four\nweeks as a replacementfor your other high\nintensity interval training.The Sugarcane involves\nselecting some form of exercisethat you can do at\nhigh intensity safely.That, of course, will\ndiffer between individuals.For some of you it will\nbe a stationary bike.For others of you, it\nwill be a road bike.For others of you,\nit will be running.And for others of you,\nit will be rowing.The exact form of\nexercise is not important.What is important\nis that you cangenerate a lot of intensity.So you're going to be doing some\nsprint like work, although notall out sprints except\non the final round.I'll explain where all\nthis is going in a moment.But again, you need\nto select a movementthat you can do without injuring\nyourself while still performinga movement at high intensity.So for me that would\nbe running, for youit might be something else.The Sugarcane is pretty\nstraightforward in structure.It involves three rounds after\na brief warm-up, of course.So you're going to do 3\nto 5 minutes of joggingor jumping jacks\nor skipping rope,something to get your\ncore body temperatureup so that you're prepared to\ndo the high-intensity work.And then there are only three\nrounds of high-intensity work.And they go as the\nfollowing, in round 1,you're going to take\n2 minutes-- so you'llneed to set a timer\nfor 2 minutes--and you're going to go the\nmaximum distance that youcan in that 2 minutes.So run the maximum distance that\nyou can for 2 minutes, or cyclethe maximum distance that\nyou can for 2 minutes,or VersaClimber the\nmaximum distancethat you can for 2 minutes.Whatever you\nselect, you're goingto do that as far and\nas fast as you canfor the duration of 2 minutes.So depending on the\nmovement and dependingon your level of\nfitness, that distancemight be 400m, 600m,\n800m, et cetera.Whatever distance you\ntravel in that 2 minutes,you are going to mark that\ndistance down in your mind,or in your phone, or\non a piece of paper.And then you're going\nto rest 2 minutes.So 2 minutes of work\nthen rest 2 minutes.Then in round 2, you're going\nto go the same distance that youdid in round 1, and you're\ngoing to take as much timeas you need to do that\ndistance as fast as you can.So if you went 600m in 2\nminutes for round 1, in round 2you're going to\ngo 600m, and it'sgoing to take you however\nlong it takes you.Chances are if you really did\nthe best you could in round 1,you were at maximum output\nfor the first 2 minutes,that in round 2 it's\ngoing to take youlonger than 2 minutes to travel\nthat equivalent distance.However, there is\nthe possibilitythat it will take you less time.But for most people, it's\ngoing to take you more time.So staying with this example of\n600m in 2 minutes on round 1,in round 2, you're\ngoing to go 600m,let's say it takes\nyou 2 minutes and 30s.You then are going to mark\ndown how long round 2 took you.So in this case, the example\nis 2 minutes and 30s.Then you're going to\nrest another 2 minutes.And then in round\n3, you're goingto go all out again\nas fast and as safelyas you can for the same duration\nthat you did in round 2.And your goal is to go at least\nas far as you went in round 1.And if there's still\ntime left, you'regoing to continue to go all out\nagain as fast as you safely canuntil the entire\nduration is completed.So it's really just three\nrounds with two rest periodsin between round 1 and round 3.And then I highly recommend\nthat after round 3,that you do some sort\nof dedicated cooldown.So instead of just flopping\non to the bench or the flooror the lawn, that you walk\naround slowly until yourecover your breathing.The reason I like the\nsugarcane as a toolthat one implements once\nevery say two to four weeksas a replacement for one's\ntypical high-intensity intervaltraining is several fold.First of all, if you\nprovide the right intensityin round 1 and\nround 2 and round 3,it is sure to elevate your\nheart rate substantially,and in doing so,\nimprove your VO2 max,which is correlated with all\nsorts of important metricsrelated to health span,\nperformance, and life span.Second of all, it gamifies\nthings a little bit.It pits you against\nyourself in the sensethat if you go out at\nmaximum speed, again,performing a movement\nthat you can safelyperform at maximum speed\nin round 1, well, thenyou have something to compete\nagainst in round 2 and round 3.And that makes the\nhigh-intensity intervaltraining, first of\nall, very intense,but also it makes\nit fun in a way thatlets you forget just how\npainful the whole thing is.The next tool to\nimprove your fitness"

            "text": "is called exercise\nsnacks and as the namesuggests this is a fun one\nand was suggested by Dr. AndyGalpin as a way to either\nenhance or maintainyour fitness depending on\nhow your core or foundationalfitness program is going.So when I say core I\ndon't mean your abs.I mean whether or not you're\ngetting your regular cardioand your regular\nresistance trainingif you were to add one or\nseveral of these exercisesnacks per week.It can further improve\nthings like VO2 max,muscular endurance, et cetera.I'll talk about\nthe specific snacksthat you will be\ndoing in a moment.However, as Dr. Andy\nGalpin also pointed out,there are times in\nwhich we happen to notbe following our foundational\nfitness program eitherbecause work demands or family\ndemands or we're traveling.We're simply not keeping\nup with our basic routine.And under those\nconditions, exercise snacksare a terrific way to maintain\nthe fitness that you've alreadybuilt and developed, and you\ndon't lose any ground in a weeksay where you get\nparticularly busy.Now, exercise snacks can take\non a variety of different forms.But for sake of\nsimplicity and clarity,today we're going to divide\nthem into two major categories.The first category\nare exercise snacksthat are going to\nimprove or maintainyour cardiovascular fitness,\nso your ability to runor cycle or row some distance\nsay 12 minutes or longer.But keep in mind these exercise\nsnacks are very, very brief.They don't require that you do\nthem for 12 minutes or longer.What they are going to do is\neither maintain or enhancethe type of\nendurance that allowsyou to continue in an activity\nfor 12 minutes or longer.The second category\nof exercise snackrelates to muscular endurance.Muscular endurance is a very\nimportant aspect of fitness.And even though some\npeople are alreadytraining for muscular\nendurance, it'ssomething that most people are\nnot doing enough training for.Muscular endurance\nis your abilitysay to maintain a wall set\nor to maintain a plank,or to do the maximum\nnumber of push-upsthat you can do in one session.The sort of drop to the floor\nand give me as many push-upsas you possibly can type of\nthing, or as many sit-upsas you can type of thing.Muscular endurance\ntranslates to a numberof other aspects of\nfitness, and it's somethingthat we should\nall be working on.And again, many people just\ndon't make space for itin their regular routine.So now we have these two\ncategories of exercise snacks.One geared toward\nenhancing or maintainingyour cardiovascular\nfitness as it translatesto longer duration endurance\nactivities, so 12 minutesor longer.And then the other category\nis purely muscular endurance,which is essentially some\nbout of exercise that'sgoing to be fairly\nbrief, anywherefrom a minute to 2 minutes but\ncertainly less than 12 minutes.OK, so let me give you\nan example of an exercisesnack for enhancing your\nlong-duration endurance,12 minutes or longer.And this is the sort\nof thing that if youare going to incorporate\ninto your routine,and I highly\nrecommend that you do,can essentially be done\nany time with no warm-up.A good example of an\nexercise snack of this typewould be to suddenly\nstand up from your deskand to do 100 jumping jacks.Now, depending on\nhow fit you areand how fast you do\nthose jumping jacksand how wide and tall you\ndo those jumping jacks,meaning are you doing\nthese little things whereyour hands don't actually meet\nand your hands like partingyour legs just a\nlittle bit, or are youdoing full jumping jacks\nwhere you're reallyjumping and setting\nyour feet outas wide as you\ncomfortably and safely canand then bring your\nhands together,it could take you anywhere\nfrom 30 seconds to 90 seconds.OK.So in the case of\njumping jacks, youmay end up doing\nthis for 90 seconds.But the point is to simply\ndo 100 jumping jacks.Or if that takes too\nlong, you could evendo just 25 or 50 jumping jacks.The point is that it's going\nto get you moving your muscles.It's going to get\nyour heart rate up.Even if you're very, very fit if\nyou're doing these fast enoughand you're doing them\nwith proper form,it's going to get\nyour heart rate up.And then you're done.You can sit back\ndown to your deskor you can continue to\nwalk through the airport.Yes, I've done these\nin the airport.Typically not while walking\ntoward my gate but at the gate.But occasionally I'm\nfeeling lethargic,or I haven't had the\nopportunity to train that day,and perhaps I won't get\nthe opportunity to train,so I'll do something\nlike 100 jumping jackswhile facing the\nwindow so it feelsa little less awkward facing\npeople while you're doing them.And of course, you don't\nhave to do jumping jacks.And equally effective\ntype of exercise snackis to find a stairwell\nand to simplygo up that stairwell\nas fast as you safelycan for 20 to 30 seconds.So perhaps just find the\nbottom of a stairwelland go up that stairwell\nas quickly as you can.And perhaps go down\nas quickly as you can.And just keep doing that\nfor about 20 to 40 seconds,and then you're\nessentially done.OK.You could also opt to\npick some distance awayfrom your car in\nthe parking lot,assuming you're not carrying\nany heavy bags or anything,and simply run to your car.So 20 to 30 seconds of not\nnecessarily all out sprinting.You don't want to\ninjure yourself.Because again, this is\ndone without a warm-up.These exercise\nsnacks are designedto be inserted into your\nday and into your weekessentially at random.You could plan them if you want.But any time you feel inspired,\nor perhaps any time you'refeeling like you\ndon't want to do one,you could simply do one\nof these exercise snacks.And of course, doing jumping\njacks, or running to your car,or taking the stairs\nvery quickly up and down,or just up and\nthen walking down,for instance, and doing a\nfew jumping jacks, thingsof that sort, of course,\ncan take on a near infinitenumber of different variations.So if you don't like\nany of the variationsthat I just presented,\nyou can easilycome up with something else.Again, the purpose of\nthese exercise snacksis to get your heart rate up.It's of course, to do this\nwhile not getting injured,and it is entirely compatible\nwith an existing exerciseprogram.It in no way is going to impede\nyour performance in strengthor hypertrophy or other\nforms of long-form enduranceor high-intensity\ninterval training, quiteto the contrary.Everything we know about\nthese exercise snacksis that they enhance various\naspects of your physiologyin ways that promote\nboth recoveryand performance in your\nother types of exerciseand your other types\nof athletic endeavors.So no reason to think\nthat they are going to beproblematic for your training.But of course, don't\ntrip, don't fall,don't undertake a\nmovement that puts youinto a range of motion that has\nhurting your back, your knee,or any other part of your body.Start off slowly\nand find somethingthat really works for you.So these are very easy.They take very little time.They're fun to be honest.And as was discussed in the\nconversation with Dr. AndyGalpin, they're\nalso very effective.The second category\nof exercise snackare the exercise snacks that\nenhance muscular endurance.So muscular endurance\nis the type of endurancethat allows you to\nmaintain a fixed positionfor some period of time usually\nsomewhere between 1 and 3minutes.But these endurance\nbouts are nevergoing to last 12 or\nmore minutes, unless youare exceptionally\nevolved in termsof your muscular\nendurance abilities.What I'm talking about here\nare things like planks,wall sits, maximum number of\npush-ups, things of that sort.And this is an aspect\nof fitness thattranslates to other\naspects of fitnessin a very important way.And again, this was covered\nin the exercise serieswith Dr. Andy Galpin.I don't want to go\ninto any of the detailsnow because it was\nall covered there.It's very easy to look up\nbecause it's time stamped.But just being brief,\nmuscular enduranceallows the buildup of more\nmicrovascular supply to musclesand connective\ntissue in a way thatallows delivery and removal\nof more nutrients and wasteproducts.Now, I realize to the physios\nthings like nutrients and wasteproducts is far too\nbroad a category,but what we're\ntalking about hereis the ability to deliver\nmore fuel and oxygenand to remove waste\nproducts of muscular effort,or to be more specific,\nneuromuscular effort.This is a great\nthing because it canhelp you enhance your\nstrength training,enhance your\nhypertrophy training,enhance your long-distance\nendurance and your middledistance and even your\nshort distance endurance.And these exercise snacks for\nbuilding muscular enduranceare exceedingly easy to do.And you can even do them\nwhile talking on the phone,especially if you're\nusing headphones,or if you have your\nphone on speaker.A good example of an exercise\nsnack for muscular endurancewould be a 30 to 60-second\nor perhaps longer wall sit.So remember wall sits?Wall sits are as\nthe name suggestswhere you put your feet out\nsome distance from a wall.You squat down into\na seated position,but there's no chair\nthere, and thenyou maintain that\nseated position,and that is harder\nto do over time.You could lean back against\nthe wall a little bitharder if you wanted to\ngain some extra supportand continue.But the idea here\nis that you're goingto go not necessarily\nto muscular failurebut to the point where you\ncan't continue to sit inthat wall sit position.You could also simply do\nthis as an air squat downto the bottom position\nwhere you're comfortable.And then you don't want\nto rest down there,and you want to maintain some\ntension in your quadricepsand other muscles\nof your lower bodyso that you're actively\ntrying to support yourselfin the seated position but\nwithout a seat below you.That can be done again while\non a speakerphone conversation,that can be done at\nrandom throughout the day.You can just decide, OK, I'm\ngoing to do a wall sit now,and I'm going to time myself.I'm going to see how\nlong I can do this for.Or you could decide\nto do a plank.I've done this while\non a phone call.Sorry if it was that\nI was talking to,but I've put the\nphone on speakerand just gotten into\na plank position,and then I'll just have the\nconversation in the plankposition.I don't fight to maintain that\nplank position past the pointwhere I could continue\nto have a conversation.So again, this is\na type of exercisethat one is trying\nto incorporateinto their daily routine.If you wanted to dedicate\na specific amount of timejust to doing these\nexercise snacks, you could.But it's far more\nreasonable to assumethat people will incorporate\nthese into their daily routinemore regularly if\nyou can incorporateit truly into the other\naspects your routine like work.You do this while watching\nTV, or listening to a podcast.One form of muscular\nendurance exercise snackthat's really terrific and is a\nbit of a challenge, that's funis to just simply see how\nmany push-ups you can do.And we talked about proper\npush-up form during the episodeseries with Dr. Andy Galpin, but\nhere what we're talking aboutis chest all the\nway to the groundso it touches the ground, then\npushing up until your arms arecompletely straight.That's one push-up.And then continuing in\npiston-like fashion,meaning you're not\npausing at the topand taking a bunch of breaths.You're not going into a\nplank position in other wordsbut continuing to\ndo as many push-upsas you can to see\nwhether or not you canenhance that number over time.And in any case, just\nto simply get your bodyworking to engage the muscles\nof your chest, your shoulders,your triceps, and your\ncore, et cetera, and todo that every once in a while.So instead of needing somebody\nto say drop and give me 20,just see whether or not\nat some point, any pointthroughout the day, you can\nget into a push-up positionand do your maximum\nnumber of push-ups,and then just mentally note\nthat number to yourself.Again, these exercise\nsnacks serve multiple roles.They're designed\nto get you moving,to get your heart rate\ngoing, to maintain or enhanceyour fitness in other\ndomains of fitness.And this is very important\nto not take too much time outof your schedule.In fact, like zone\n2 cardio, right,being the type of\nmovement that you're justgoing to do a lot throughout\nthe week carrying groceries,et cetera, as we\ndiscussed earlier,these exercise\nsnacks are designedto be incorporated\ninto your daily life.And I must say that\nhaving started doing theseafter recording the series\nwith Dr. Andy Galpin,I've noticed two things.First of all, including\nthese exercisesnacks at least once a week and\nmore like three to five timesa week for me, so that's\none exercise snackdone three to five times\nper week has definitelycorrelated with\nimprovements in my fitnessin other domains of fitness,\nstrength, hypertrophy,long-distance\nendurance, et cetera.Now, I've changed a\nnumber of other thingsas well as a consequence of that\nseries with Dr. Andy Galpin.So I can't say for sure that\nit's the exercise snacks per sethat are causing all\nthose positive shifts.I have to imagine that it's\nnot just the exercise snacks,but they've become an\nimportant part of my routineand that relates to\nthe second point, whichis that the exercise snacks\nare to be fun and easy.And so I really enjoy\nthem, so much sothat if I don't one\nfor couple of days,I start to crave\nthem a little bitlike the other kind of snack.The next category of tool\nto improve your fitness"

of exercise.And again here we're talking\nabout resistance training,but we could just\nas easily be talkingabout rest between rounds of\nsay high-intensity intervaltraining.So for instance, between\nbouts of sprintingon the track or the bike or\nthe treadmill or the rower.A great pattern of breathing\nto incorporate during restbetween sets is\nsomething that I'vetalked about before in\nother contexts whichis the physiological side.The physiological side is a\ndeep Inhale through the noseto maximally or near\nmaximally inflate your lungs,and then a second\nvery brief inhale,and it's necessarily brief\nbecause your lungs are alreadypretty full, to maximally\ninflate your lungsand to make sure that\nany of the little sacsor the little\nalveoli of your lungsthat have collapsed during\nthe exercise exertionwill reinflate.And then a long exhale\nuntil lungs empty.So I'll demonstrate it right now\nas I've done many times before.But if you haven't seen\nit or heard it before,it's two inhales followed\nby an extended exhale.And it goes like this.[INHALE, EXHALE]You'll notice that the\ninhales were through the noseand the exhale was\nthrough the mouth.That's the ideal way to do\nit for a number of reasons.Check out the episode that I\ndid on respiration physiologya.k.a. breathing if you want\nmore details on why that is.But two inhales through the\nnose and a long extended exhalethrough the mouth, the so-called\nphysiological side not namedby me but rather named by\nphysiologists in the 1930is as far as we know,\nthe fastest way to shiftyour nervous system from\nso-called sympathetic driveto more parasympathetic\ndrive, from a stateof greater alertness to\na state of greater calm.Now, the reason to do this\nbetween sets of resistancetraining is that the more\nthat you can shift yourselffrom sympathetic drive to\nparasympathetic drive, thatis from alert to calm in\nbetween sets, the more energyand focus you can devote to\nexertion during your work sets.So one way to do this that's\nvery convenient and veryeffective is to consider\nthe last repetitionof your set, a physiological\nsigh, which is notto say, OK, I want\nto be very clear,which is not to\nsay that you shoulddo the physiological\nside during your set.In fact, I recommend\nthat you do not do that.But rather if you're doing\nsix repetitions of a givenexercise and you, let's\nsay, fail on the sixthor you do that sixth repetition\nand you're just closeto failure because again your\nwork set should be to failureor close to it most of the\ntime, then set down the weight,and then you're going to\ndo the next repetitionas the physiological\nsigh, meaning you're notgoing to do the movement.You're going to think of\ndoing a physiological sighas the last repetition\nof every set,not during the last repetition\nof the resistance trainingmovement, OK.So the physiological\nsigh is somethingyou do at the beginning\nof the rest periodimmediately following a set.If you'd rather think\nabout it that waybecause it's more\nconvenient than thinkingabout it as the last rep\nof a set, be my guest.Whatever works for you.But what you'll quickly\nfind is that if youdo a physiological sigh\nright after completingyour last repetition, you'll\ncalm down much more quickly,your heart rate will\ncome down more quickly,and you'll recover more\ncompletely in whateverdesignated rest period\nyou've allowed yourself,whether or not it's\n30 seconds, whichwould be very short frankly, or\nit's a 5-minute period of restbetween sets.If you do one truly, just\none physiological sighat the beginning\nof the rest period,you are going to effectively\nshift your nervous systemin the direction you want it to\ngo during those rest periods.And of course, if you're\ntraining hard during your worksets you run zero\nrisk whatsoeverof feeling so calm\nthat you don't feelmotivated to do your next set.I promise you that it will\nallow you to relax moreat the beginning\nof the rest periodthan you ordinarily would, to\nshift into a state of rest.There are differing opinions\nabout whether or notyou should walk around or stay\nstill during your rest periods.I like to walk around a\nbit and stay standing.I'm not one of these\npeople that collapsesinto a C-shape on the\nbench in between sets.I like to stand up and breathe\nnormally and walk around, drinka little water, et cetera.In any case, doing\na physiological sidethe beginning of\neach rest intervalbetween work sets of\nresistance trainingis a very effective\nway to enhanceyour focus and your output\nduring your work sets.Now, the last respiration\ntool to improve your fitnessis again a tool gleaned from\nthe discussion with Dr. AndyGalpin, and that's\nto include a 3 to 5minute period at the end\nof every single workout.So it doesn't matter if\nit's high-intensity intervaltraining, or it's\nresistance training,or it's a long run of some sort,\nat the end of every workout,to take 3 to 5 minutes, so\nyou'll want to set a timer,and to do some form of\nparasympathetic, thatis calming promoting\nbreathing in orderto shift your nervous system\nfrom a state of heightenedalertness and output\ninto a state of recovery.Because as you all\nwell know by now,you get fitter not\nduring your workoutsbut rather after your\nworkouts, in between workouts.So you stimulate the\nadaptation during a workout,but you get the adaptation,\nyou get the actual improvementin between workouts.And a common mistake that\nmany people make, and Imade this mistake for years,\nwas to finish a great workout,and then you're\ntexting on your phone,or you're talking on the\nphone, or you're driving home.It's certainly not as intense as\nthe workout that you just did.Maybe you're even feeling really\ncalm from a nice long jog,or you had a particularly\ngood workout that dayand you're feeling really happy.So you're enjoying the\nhigh, so to speak, well,when you do 3 to 5 minutes\nof what's often called downregulation breathing\nafter a workout,it allows you to\nrecover and to inducethe adaptation that\nyou've been after, the onethat you actually trained\nfor much more quickly.I can't tell you\nhow many people Iknow who start to incorporate\nthis into their workouts,find that they recover far\nbetter from their workouts,which might seem a\nlittle bit surprising.Why would it be that just 3\nto 5 minutes of some activitywould enhance recovery\nto such a great degree?And that's because\ntypically peopledon't bookend their workouts.They finish their workouts,\nand of course, they'renot continuing to\nlift weights or run.But they move about\ntheir day in their lifeeven if it's preparing a meal in\na way that the level of stress,and therefore, stress\nhormones, things like cortisol,adrenaline, things\nthat by the wayare excellent to elevate\nduring a workout, thingslike inflammatory\nmarkers, which by the way,are great to enhance\nduring a workout.That actually happens\nduring a workout.You have a massive increase\nin inflammatory markers, whichmight seem bad, but\nall of those thingsare enhancing the adaptation\nthat you're seeking.But as soon as\nthose workouts end,you want to shift\ninto recovery mode.And this 3 to 5 minutes of\ndown regulation breathingis a terrific way to do that.There are a couple of\ndifferent patterns of breathingthat will work best, but all\nof them emphasize exhales.OK.I want to repeat that, all\nof them emphasize exhales.So for instance, you\ncould just chooseslow, deliberate breathing.How does that emphasize exhales?Well, ordinarily when we\nbreathe, we inhale activelyand we exhale passively.Whenever we deliberately\nbreathe more slowly,we are actively exhaling.OK, so active exhales really\npromote the calming responsein brain and body.The other thing you could do\nwhich many people are now doingis to do a repeated round\nof physiological sighs.So the double inhale\nthrough the nose,long exhale through the mouth\nbut repeated for say 3 minutes.That's another version.The other thing you could do is\nsimply to notice your exhalesand to emphasize your exhales,\nmake them longer and morevigorous than your inhales.Now, you don't want to turn this\ninto a breathwork session whereyou're--[INHALE,EXHALE]--you're doing it Pranayama\nor Kundalini breathingor something of that sort.The idea is to calm down.So any time you're\nextending your exhales,you're actively\nexhaling, you're tryingto slow your breathing\ndown overall,you're going to shift yourself\nin the right direction.So rather than complicate\nthis type of tool,the best thing you can do is\njust focus on those exhales,slow your breathing overall,\nuse physiological sighsif you want, or simply\nsit in your vehicle,or if you have to\ndrive home while doingthis extended exhale\ntype of down regulation.Ideally you would take\na couple of minutesand just shift your whole\nsystem by not driving, closingyour eyes and just sitting in\nyour car stationary, of course,don't drive with your eyes\nclosed, or bike with your eyesclosed.Just simply calm down,\nextend your exhalesand shift from the\nworkout to the recoverymode, which is where the\nprogress is going to arrive.I'd like to take a quick break\nand acknowledge our sponsor"

            "text": "psychological tools,\nand they're reallygeared toward enhancing your\nfocus during your workoutand separating or\nsegmenting your workoutsfrom the other\nparts of your day.Now, of course,\nworkouts are naturallysegmented from the\nother parts of your day,unless you're running\naround all day long,or you're lifting weights or\nother heavy objects all daylong.But one of the more\nattractive toolsthat was presented during\nthe series with Dr. Galpinthat I adopted and found\nto be really effectiveis this concept of the line.The line is this concept that\nyou have a physical location,say at the entrance to a gym\nor at the start of your runor your bike or maybe it's\naround the stationary exercisedevice that you use for which\nonce you cross that line,you are all about business.OK.You're not socializing\nor at least not too much.You don't want to\nbe rude to people,but you're really\nfocused on your workout.So this is especially\neffective on dayswhen you're a little\nbit distracted,or you didn't sleep that\nwell the night before,or maybe you've got something\ngoing on in your mind,or you're in an\nargument, or you'reexcited about something else.But if you care about\nyour fitness, whichI hope everyone does, and\nyour goal during any workoutis to stimulate\na particular typeof physiological adaptation\nstrength, hypertrophy,long-distance\nendurance, et cetera,and you also don't want to\nget injured so that you cancontinue to train\nfor your entire lifeas regularly as possible,\nthe concept of the lineis fantastic\nbecause what it doesis it forces you\nto compartmentalizethe portion of your lesson\nthat comes before the workoutand after the workout and also\nto really enjoy your workouts.This is something that's\nnot often discussed,but nowadays with the\nadvent of smartphones,there's a lot of infiltration\nof other types of communicationand information while one is\nsupposed to be exercising.And so our life has become\nfar less compartmentalizedthan it used to be before\nthe advent of smartphones.Now, of course,\nsmartphones are wonderful.They provide all sorts of\nwonderful tools and benefits,and of course, I use one.And I'll talk about\nhow to incorporatethe smartphone in\na very specific wayto enhance your workouts\nin just a moment.But the idea of a line\nis you pick a location.It can change with each\nworkout, but ideally itwould be at the threshold of\nwhere the physical locationto the workout begins.And once you cross that\nline, you are all business.You are taking care of business.Which is not to say that you\ncan't enjoy your workouts.In fact, you absolutely should.One of the best pieces of advice\nthat I ever got about fitnesswas given to me when\nI was a teenagerand I started lifting weights.And the person who was teaching\nme how to do that said,one of the best\nthings that you can doand you absolutely should do\nfor your fitness now and foreveris to learn to\nenjoy training hard.And that really stuck with me.I really do enjoy\ntraining hard, but thatwas something that I\nlearned how to do over time.I took on the mentality\nthat I'm here by choice,I'm here for my own\ngood and my own fitnessto enhance my life so I'm\ngoing to enjoy training hard,I'm going to enjoy\ntraining effectively.And of course, there are days\nwhen I train a little less hardor I back off quite a bit.I even take rest\nperiods of a weekevery once in a while,\nevery say 12 to 16 weeksI'll take a week off and just\ndo some activities like hikingand things of that sort.I talk to all about\nextended layoffs,meaning a layoff of more than\ntwo days during the episodethat I did by myself, which is\nthe Optimal Fitness protocolsepisode.But in any case, learning to\ntrain hard and enjoy traininghard and really making\nthe workout something thatis separate from the\nrest of your lifeis one of the most\ngratifying thingsthat you can do to enhance\nyour overall fitness because itreally teaches you\nhow to designateyour mind and your body toward\nthis one specific set of goalswhile you are there\nand to really enjoythe process because\nfitness can be a trulyenjoyable process even when\nyou are exerting yourself,especially hard.And for you\nmasochists out there,it can be, especially\nbecause you're training hardthat it feels so good.In any event, the key is to\nset some sort of boundaryand know that when you\ncross into that boundary,you're training.And when you cross\nout of that boundary,you're done training,\nwhich also lends itselfto more adequate recovery\nand the decompression typebreathing exercises that\nwe talked about before.I'm not going to tell\nyou whether or notyou need to do the\ndown regulationbreathing at the end of\nyour workout within the lineor after you cross the line.That's up to you.I don't think one needs\nto get that specific.Now, another tool that's\nwonderfully effective"

            "text": "not just for your workouts\nbut for all areas of your lifeis if you are going to bring\na smartphone to your workouts,to set some boundaries\naround what you'regoing to listen to and\ndo with that smartphoneduring your workouts.I see people texting.I see people doing selfies.I see people having phone calls.I see people, I presume,\nlistening to music or podcasts.Look, I am not the smartphone\npolice nor are you,and everyone has a right to\nuse their smartphone in the waythat they choose\nas best for themin order to distract\nthemselves or focus themselvesor enrich their life.Look, it's a free world,\nof course, more for somethan for others,\nbut you can do whatyou want with your smartphone.However, if your goal is\nto improve your fitness,one of the more powerful things\nyou can do with your smartphoneis to decide before you cross\nthe line into your workout whatyou're going to listen to or\ndo with that phone or not.So for me, I like to\ndesignate a playlist of musicfor that particular\nworkout, and thenI just stick to that playlist.I might repeat songs\nthat I like a lot,or if someone talks to me\nwhile the music is playing,I might go back and restart\na song if they distracted me,that sort of thing.Although, I do my best to not\nget into too much social chitchat during workouts,\nbut I'm friendly,and it's nice when people\ncome over and say hello.I sometimes work out with\nother people in which caseI don't use headphones,\nI don't use a smartphone.But setting a playlist or two,\ndesignating a podcast or two,designating an audiobook\nor two, whateverit is that you're going to\nlisten to really decide whatthat's going to be before\nyou do your workout.And the reason I say this is\nthat I observe a lot of people,and frankly, I've observed\nmyself under conditions whereI'm suddenly in a\ntext communication,or I'm bouncing between\nalbums or between podcastsor between whatever it is\non the phone to the pointwhere rest intervals aren't\nbeing controlled well,to the point where\nfocus during setsbecomes harder to achieve\nat the beginning of a setbecause in between sets I was\nfocused on a conversation noton training.I'm a big believer in\nmaking your exercise fun,making it accessible,\nmeaning not soexpensive or\ngeographically difficultto achieve that you don't do it\nor that it starts to interferewith other areas of life.This is really important.You want fitness to be blended\nwith the rest of your life,but you don't want it so blended\nwith the rest of your lifethat the rest of your life\nstarts to impede your efforts.Or and this happens quite\noften for a lot of peoplethat workouts start to\ntake an hour and a half,two hours when they could easily\nbe completed in 45 minutesto an hour if you were just\nmore efficient with your time.And of course, you don't\nneed me to tell you this,but smartphones can be one of\nthe major bleeds on our focusand efficiency.In fact, it can cause\nyou to hemorrhagefocus and efficiency.So what I'm\nsuggesting here is notthrowing away your smartphone,\nalthough, some peopledo benefit from just\nleaving it in the caror at home when\nthey are training.But rather to designate\npodcasts, books, musicplaylists for that\nparticular workoutand to just stick to those for\nthe duration of your workout.And once you cross\ninto the line,that's what you're listening\nto and only that or nothing.And of course, once you\ncross back over the lineas you finish your\nworkout, you candecide to continue to\nlisten to the podcast,or continue to listen to the\naudiobook, or to the music.That's up to you.Although, I highly\nrecommend that you doincorporate that\ndownregulation periodof 3 to 5 minutes minimum.The last category of tools\nto improve your fitnesscome from the discussions about\nnutrition and supplementationand recovery in the series\nwith Dr. Andy Galpin.Now, the list of tools\nI'm about to describeis not exhaustive,\nmeaning it doesn't evenbegin to come close to\nthe total number of toolsthat one could glean from the\ndiscussion about nutritionand supplementation\nthat I had with Dr. AndyGalpin on this podcast, but\nthey are the major ones thatare definitely worth knowing.And those include supplementing\nwith omega 3 fatty acids.Now, omega 3 fatty acids\nare found of course"

            "text": "under this category of\nnutrition and supplementationis creatine.Now, again, creatine is not\njust found in supplement form.It's also found, of course, in\nfoods, in particular red meat.However, the amount\nof red meat that onewould have to eat in order\nto get the amount of creatinethat one would start to see\na real performance enhancingeffect is just far too high.You'd be ingesting far too much\nof other things in red meatthat you wouldn't\nwant that much of.And for that reason, I\nand many other peoplewill take creatine daily.We now know there's no need\nto so-called load creatininein the old days as it were.So old days, by the way,\nmeaning mid '90s and 2000s,we were all told that\nwe had to load creatine,we had to take high-dose\ncreatine for four or five daysand then you could back\noff to a maintenance dose.Now it's very clear you can just\ntake a daily dose of creatine.And that it really\ndoesn't matterwhen you take that creatine.You can take it post-workout\nas many people do.You can take it preworkout.It really doesn't\nseem to matter.I happen to take it postworkout\njust as a matter of habit.But again, you can take\nit any time of day.Now, the point I want\nto make about creatineis one that's a bit different\nthan the other discussionsout there.I have no issue\nwith the majorityof what's discussed\nabout creatine out there,for instance, that\ncreatine monohydrateis the most effective form.Fortunately,\ncreatine monohydrateis also the least\nexpensive form of creatinethat's sold out there.I see no evidence whatsoever\nthat the other formsof creatine are superior\nto creatine monohydrate.But what you'll usually\nhear is that taking5 grams of creatine monohydrate\nper day is ideal for everybody.And that advice is\nsimply not well-informedby the scientific literature.If you are a larger person,\nso for instance I weigh 100kgso that's about 220\npounds, well, itturns out if you look\nat the literatureon creatine and\nathletic performance,and if you look\nat the literatureon creatine and\ncognitive performance,because as some of\nyou already know,creatine is a fuel or the\nphosphocreatine systemis a fuel system for\nthe brain as well.And if you look at the\nstudies on creatine,they almost always gauge\nthe amount of creatineto give an individual\nbased on their body weight.So you don't have to get\nreally specific about this,but if you weigh, say,\n185 pounds to 250 pounds,you can get away with\nand probably shouldbe taking 10 grams or\nso of creatine per day,which is what I do.Whereas if you weigh less\nthan that, 5 grams or maybeeven 3 grams is sufficient.Now, I discussed this with Dr.\nAndy Galpin during that series,and one of the things\nthat I've startedto do since the\nclosure of that seriesis to take more\ncreatine per day.So now I'm taking\n10, sometimes evenas much as 15 grams\nper day of creatine.Again, this is powdered\ncreatine monohydrate.My stomach tolerates\nit very well,but frankly, I don't\ntend to get stomach achesor gastric distress from\npretty much anything,unless it's some form\nof food poisoning, whichis exceedingly rare for me.So some people out there\nfind that creatine reallydisrupts their gut, and they\nneed to take it with foodor they really need\nto slowly and increasethe amount of creatine that\nthey're taking each day.I find that I can put 10\neven 15 grams of creatineinto a whey protein\nshake or into some waterwith a little bit\nof lemon juice,just to make it taste a little\nless chalky, drink that,and I don't have any\ngastric distress from that.So you'll need to find\nwhat works for you.But the point here is if\nyou're going to take creatine,you don't just want\nto quote unquote,\"take creatine one\nscoop per day.\"You really want to adjust\nthe amount of creatinethat you're ingesting\naccording to your body weight.And I would give you a very\nspecific formula of x gramsof creatine per kilogram\nor pound of body weight,but believe it or not, no\nsuch specific recommendationhas ever been published in\nthe scientific literatureor at least I couldn't find\nit in a way that's consistentwith all the other\npapers, meaningyou see a lot of variation.So what I'm talking about here\nis if you weigh 185 poundsor so, OK, plus or minus 5\npounds out to about 250 pounds,10 to 15g of creatine\nper day is probablymore appropriate for\nyou than is 5 grams,meaning it's going to be\nmore effective for enhancingphysical performance.And perhaps again, perhaps even\ncognitive performance as well.And if you're somebody\nwho weighs 180 pounds downto say 130 pounds, 5\ngrams of creatine per dayis probably sufficient.The point here is if you\nare taking creatine, again,not everyone has\nto take creatine.There's no law that says that\nyou have to take creatine.Some people don't like it.I know some people\nfear it's goingto make their hair fall out.We already talked about\nthat in previous episodesand the lack of data\nto support that idea.But I realize some\npeople steer awayfrom creatine for\nwhatever reason.But if you decide that taking\ncreatine is right for you,adjust the total\namount of creatinethat you take according\nto your body weight.The next supplementation based\ntool for enhancing your fitnessis a Rhodiola rosea.Now, this very esoteric\nsounding supplementis one that I learned about,\nboth from Dr. Lane Norton whenhe was a guest on this\npodcast, expert in nutritionand frankly training as it\nrelates to resistance training,and from Dr. Andy Galpin.Rhodiola rosea is\na supplement that'sgaining increasing attention\nbecause it is what'scalled a cortisol modulator.It does not necessarily\nsuppress cortisol.It does not increase cortisol.It's a cortisol modulator.And frankly, the\nmechanism by whichRhodiola rosea\nmodulates cortisolis still under investigation.I hope to do an episode\nabout it in the futureor at least make it\npart of an episodebecause the hypothesized\nmechanism that'sstarting to emerge is really\ninteresting as it relatesto neurons in the brain that\ncontrol the stress responseand glands in the body\nlike the adrenals thatcontrol the stress response\nand that secrete cortisol.Regardless, there's a\ngrowing body of researchthat has explored Rhodiola\nrosea supplementation and one'ssubjective perception\nof fatigue or outputduring high-intensity\ntraining of various kinds,both resistance training as well\nas running and endurance typetraining.So I started taking Rhodiola\nrosea about six months agoin response to conversations\nthat I had again with Dr. LaneNorton and with Dr.\nAndy Galpin, and it'sa supplement that I take\nbefore high-intensity workouts.So I don't take it before a\nrun because frankly my runs areeither very long\nand slow, or they'revery brief like a high-intensity\ninterval training session.And I find those to be\npretty easy to recover fromeven though they\nare very intense.I might take a Rhodiola\nrosea supplementbefore doing a 30-minute\nhill run that's very intense.But typically, I only take\nit about 10 to 15 minutesbefore any sort of\nhigh-intensity resistancetraining session,\nin particular my legday which falls on day 2\nof my exercise protocol,or the torso day, or the\nsmall body parts day.Again, here I'm\nreferencing the waythat I train across the week,\nand you can find that trainingprotocol as a downloadable\ncompletely zero-costif you like.But I realize other people\nare using different bodypart splits and different\ncombinations of resistancetraining and endurance training.The reason I mentioned\nRhodiola rosea in this episodeis that I realized that while\nsome people might not yetbe supplementing omega 3s,\nthey might not be supplementingcreatine, there are many\nof you who are alreadydoing those things, and you're\nlooking for additional toolsto give you an edge.So again, the Rhodiola\nrosea would notfall into the category of\nfoundational supplements.Certainly, get your nutrition\nright, get your sleep right,get your sunlight.All the basics first\nplease before eventhinking about any supplements.However, once you get into\nthe category of supplementsthat can enhance\nfitness, Rhodiola roseadoes seem to have\nsome good researchto support it in\nthe context of lotsof different forms of\nhigh-intensity exercise.Now, I can't tell you whether\nor not it's purely subjectiveor whether or not it's\nobjective and subjective,but my experience has been\nthat when I take Rhodiola roseaI definitely notice\nthat I can exert myselfharder without feeling\nlike I'm bringing myselfto the brink of fatigue\neither during the exertionor afterwards.In other words,\nI feel like I cando more work without\nfeeling so exhausted,and I feel as if I'm\nrecovering from my workoutsmore quickly, in\nparticular across the dayafter my workouts.In fact, if I had to cite one\nspecific subjective effectthat I've experienced\nfrom taking Rhodiola roseabefore very high-intensity\nworkouts is that priorto taking it, I would\noften find that 3 or 4hours after the\nworkout having eatena good meal, taking a shower,\net cetera, and I was tired.I'd have a real dip in energy.But now I notice that\nI have a lot of energythroughout the day even after\nthese very high-intensitysessions in the early\npart of the day.And frankly, I haven't\nchanged anything elseabout my supplementation\nor my nutrition, at leastnothing major.So I personally am\ngoing to continueto take Rhodiola rosea before\nthese high-intensity workouts.So for me, that's about two\nor three times per week.However, if I forgot\nto take Rhodiola roseabefore a workout,\nI have no reasonto think that workout\nwould go much worse.This is a supplement that is\ndesigned to give you an edgeto be able to exert\nmore focus and intensityduring your workouts with\nless perceived exertionand to enhance your recovery.The typical dosage\nof Rhodiola roseathat you'll find\nin most supplementsis 100 to 200 milligrams.And of course, any time you're\ngoing to take a new supplement,you would be wise to figure\nout the lowest effective dosefrom that supplement.That's just logic, right?Why spend more money\ntaking more of somethingthat you don't need more\nof if you could get awaywith taking less of it,\nand it's just as effectivemaybe even more effective?So I typically will take\n100 to 200 milligramsof Rhodiola rosea about 10 to\n20 minutes before a workout.However, I've taken as\nlittle as 100 milligramson a consistent basis, and\nfrankly, I don't reallyexperience much difference\nwhether I take 100mgor I take 200 milligrams\nbefore a workout,so lately I've just defaulted\nto taking 100 milligramsof Rhodiola rosea before\nany high-intensity workout.Now, the final tool\nthat I want to review"

            "text": "for improving your fitness comes\nfrom the category of nutrition.I've done lots of\nepisodes about nutritionalready on this podcast.We've done episodes about\nintermittent fastingI did a long interview\nepisode with Dr. Lane Nortonwhere we discussed all the\nins and outs of nutritionas it relates to fat\nloss, muscle gain, fitnessin general,\nlifestyle in general.So check out that episode where\nyou will learn his philosophyon nutrition, which frankly\nis the one that I largelysubscribe to.And of course, obeys the laws\nof thermodynamics, caloriesin, calories out being\nfundamentally important.But also gets into all sorts\nof details about which sourcesof protein are most\neffective and bioavailable,how much protein you can\nincorporate into your musclesafter training, et\ncetera, all of thatis included in that episode.With that said, the series on\nexercise with Dr. Andy Galpinalso included an\nepisode on nutrition.And while having the\ndiscussion for that episodeand then listening to\nthat episode again,I realized that while certainly\nI've gotten a number of thingsright about my nutrition\nacross the years,there are a few areas where\nI could probably do betterwithout much effort in\nways that could reallyenhance my fitness.And the thing that\nI'm referring tois that for me my first\nmeal of the day layingsomewhere around 11:00\nAM maybe 12:00 noon.Sometimes I'll eat\nan earlier breakfast,but most typically I hydrate,\ncaffeinate, and train inthe morning, and then I eat\nsome time around 11:00 or 12:00.And then I eat my\nlast meal of the daysometime around 8:30 or 9:00.And as some of you already know,\nI tend to organize my meals,such that meals during\nthe early part of the daytend to lean more toward protein\nand fibrous carbohydrates,so things like meat and salad,\nor chicken and salad, fishand salad, and maybe a\nlittle bit of starch.And the meals that I\neat later in the daytend to be more starch focused\nand more vegetable focusedor things like pasta, rice,\net cetera, later in the daybecause it helps me sleep.And the architecture\nof all that is reallyabout energy and focus.I find I can focus a bit\nbetter and I have more energythroughout the day when I have\nmy first meal at around 11:00or 12:00, and I keep the\ntotal amount of carbohydratesthat I ingest during\nthe day moderate.Not low but moderate.Now, there is an\nexception to that,which is if I do a\nhigh-intensity resistancetraining session\nearly in the morningsay train legs or train torso\nor even small body parts earlyin the morning, then I make\nsure to incorporate more starchycarbohydrates and some\nfruit, some simple sugarsas well into the\nfirst meal of the dayso that I can\nreplenish the glycogenthat I depleted during those\nhigh-intensity resistancetraining sessions.However, after talking\nto Dr. Andy Galpin,I realized that I really\nshouldn't worry about or beafraid of eating\nsomething before trainingif I'm really hungry\nin the morning.So what I'm\nreferring to here arethe times in which I wake\nup and I want to train,but I personally like to\ntrain fasted and caffeinated.OK.Yes, I do recommend that people\ndelay their caffeine intake90 to 120 minutes after\nwaking if and onlyif you have trouble\nwith an afternooncrash, real fatigue\nin the afternoon, thenit makes sense to\ndelay your caffeine 90to 120 minutes after waking.However, the\nexception to that isthat if I'm going to\ntrain early in the day,I do ingest water to hydrate\nas well as electrolytesand caffeine prior to training.And sometimes that means\nI'm drinking caffeinewithin 30 minutes or\n60 minutes of waking.I've tried to be clear about\nthis in previous episodes,but I think a number\nof people havecome to think that I\nalways delay my caffeineintake 90 to 120\nminutes after waking,and that's simply not the case.If I'm going to train,\nin particular if I'mgoing to do\nhigh-intensity resistancetraining or a long run, I will\ningest caffeine sooner than90 to 120 minutes after waking.And in addition to\nthat, yes, I tendto eat my first meal around\n11:00 AM maybe 12:00 noon.But if I wake up\nand I'm very hungry,I will eat a small meal\nthat includes typicallysome protein and some fat,\nso some Brazil nuts, maybea couple of scoops\nof whey proteinwould be typical for\nme, or maybe evena little bit of oatmeal,\nsome whey protein,not a lot of food in my gut.But after talking to\nDr. Andy Galpin, whatI learned was for some people\ntraining fasted feels best.I would consider myself\none of those people.You may be somebody in\nthat category as well,or you might be\nsomebody who reallyfeels as if you run\nbest, you resistancetrain best when you've eaten say\n90 minutes or a couple of hoursbefore you do that.There are basically\nno specific rulesas it relates to whether or not\nyou train fasted or train fedexcept in what you can handle\nin terms of gastric distress.So you want to make food\nchoices according to thatand try and avoid, of\ncourse, gastric distress.But basically the change that\nI've made is if I wake upand I'm hungry, I'll\neat a small meal,or if I want to work\nout in the afternoonor I have to work\nout in the afternoonand I have lunch at say,\n12:00 or 12:30 or 11:00 AMand the only opportunity\nthat I have to trainis 1:00 PM or even 12:30,\nI will go ahead and train.And that's a new thing for me.Typically, I try\nto keep my mealsat least three to four hours\nprior to any training bout.And of course, if you're\nsleeping all night,you're not eating, and then if\nyou wake up and you don't eatand you train in the\nmorning, that's certainlylonger than three or four\nhours unless you're sleepingvery, very little frankly.So essentially what I'm\nsaying is figure outwhat works best for you.Do you prefer to\ntrain fasted or fed?For some of you, you might\nprefer fasted before cardioand fed before\nresistance training.For some of you, it might\nbe fasted is always best.Again, I put myself\nin that category.For some of you, it might\nbe fed is always best.Again, this is\nhighly individual.And that's another point\nthat I'm trying to make here,which is Dr. Galpin really\nimpressed upon me that thereis no hard and fast rule\nabout training fasted or fed.And, this is the second point,\nthat having some flexibilityin whether or not you\ncan train fasted or fedallows you to incorporate\nyour fitness trainingsessions more readily\ninto a shifting schedule.And that's a really\noverarching theme of everything"
