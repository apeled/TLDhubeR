            "text": "to answering your questions.The first question\nis about kratom.And the question is, what are\nthe short and long-term effectsof taking kratom?For those of you that\nhaven't heard of kratom,kratom is a substance that\ncomes from a tree thatgrows naturally in Indonesia.The tree itself is called\nmitragyna speciosa.And it's been known for\nhundreds of years or more.We don't really know how long,\nbut at least for a coupleof hundred years,\nthat when people chewthe leaves of this tree, they\nexperience a mild stimulanteffect.And there's also a\nprocess of extractionwhereby you can take the leaves\nand get high concentrationsof kratom that\nnowadays is packagedinto various supplements.Most often consumed\nin capsule form,although sometimes it's\nsold in raw powder form.Here's the key thing to\nunderstand about kratom.Indeed at low dosages, kratom\nhas a mild stimulant effect.However, at higher\ndosages, it haswhat's called an\nanalgesic effect, thatis a painkilling effect,\nand it acts as a sedative.And kratom itself acts\nas an opioid in the body.This is what's making kratom\na very controversial topicthese days.In particular,\nbecause most peoplehave heard of the\nso-called opioid crisis.The opioid crisis\nhas been a termcoined to largely\ncenter around issuesthat have taken place\nin the United States,although these issues\ndefinitely extendbeyond the borders\nof the United States.But the opioid\ncrisis is essentiallythe overconsumption and\nwidespread addictionto opioids.Opioids include\nthings like morphine,oxycodone, also\ncalled OxyContin,and there are other opioids\nsimilar to those compounds,all of which have the general\neffect of being painkillersand sedatives.And in some people,\nagain some people,eliciting a sense of\neuphoria in particularat low to moderate dosages.However, people quickly develop\na tolerance to those drugsand need to consume\nmore and more of themin order to get the\neffect that they initiallygot from a lower dosage.And they are not just\nhighly habit-forming.They are highly addictive.And we can distinguish\nbetween habitforming and addictive by simply\nsaying that addictive meanspeople will continue to take\nsomething or do somethingdespite negative consequences.There are other relevant\ndefinitions of addictionas well.I define addiction more broadly\nas the progressive narrowingof the things that\ngive you pleasure.And indeed, when people\nget addicted to opioids,it is a very bad picture.It often hampers many,\nmany areas of their lives,and seriously so.So the opioid crisis refers\nto the overprescriptionof opioid drugs.That's sort of what it\ngenerally taken to mean.But it also includes accessing\nopioids such as morphine,oxycodone, et cetera through\ngray market sources through,black market sources,\nand on and on.And of course, the\nacquisition of the drugsis just one piece it's\nalso the over consumptionof those drugs and, of course,\nthe addiction to those drugs,which has proved to\nbe so pernicious.So what does this have\nto do with kratom?Kratom is also an opioid.And we'll talk\nabout how it differsin its opioid properties from\nthe drugs I just talked aboutbecause it is different from\nmorphine and hydrocodone,but it also has some\nsimilar properties as well.But the deal with kratom\nis that a good numberof people out there have\nmanaged to wean themselvesoff opioids such as\nmorphine and hydrocodonethrough the use of kratom.And that has been\nused as justificationfor keeping kratom on the\nmarket and keeping it legal.However, and this is a\nvery important however,kratom itself has also proved\nto be not only habit formingbut addictive, especially when\ntaken at dosages that exceedthat lower dose that\njust generally createsa bit of stimulant, a little\nbit of euphoric effect.When people start taking\nhigher dosages of kratom,it is very clear that it\ndoes become addictive,and itself is very\nhard to come off of,so much so that people\nexperience so-called kratomwithdrawal.Now the reason I\nmentioned that kratomhas been used by a\ngood number of peopleto wean themselves off\nof the more potent formsof prescription\nopioids is that whenI solicited for questions\nabout kratom on social media,it was a very binary response.In fact, there was one\ncamp a very rabid campthat said kratom is terrible.I took this stuff.I got addicted.It was extremely\nhard to come off of.There were additional\ncomments in there,such as I know\nsomebody who literallyhad to go to rehab\nbecause of kratom whodeveloped a bunch of other\naddictions because of kratom.Essentially many, many responses\nof people who had only badexperiences with kratom.Meaning they liked\nit enough at firstthat they continued to take\nit, and it became addictivefor them or somebody\nthat they know.However, there was another\ncamp that was equally vocal,which kept saying no if one\nreally adheres to the lowerdosages of kratom,\nkratom itself canbe a useful tool for\ngetting off other opioids.And there were even a few bona\nfide medical professionals,medical doctors that is,\nand I happen to know themand their reputations as quite\ngood, who chimed in and sort ofreconciled the two\ncamps by sayingindeed, if one can avoid taking\nkratom at all, you should.There is no reason to take\nthis thing thinking that it'squote-unquote good for you.You would be wise\nto avoid taking itbecause there is a high\nprobability if you take itat a given dosage or at a dosage\nthat is going to get your brainand body into a state\nof euphoria, analgesia,and the sort of\nclassic opioid effectthat it's going to become habit\nforming or addicting for you.That said, these same\nmedical professionalsacknowledged that a fair\nnumber of people that they knewmanaged to get off of the\nmore potent forms of opioidssuch as morphine, oxycodone,\nand so forth using kratom.And they said, well if\nit's a choice between beingaddicted to morphine and\nhydrocodone versus takingkratom and addicted to those\nsubstances and kratom somehowallowed them to taper\noff of those substances,that they would look more\nfavorably upon kratomif and only if they would\nalso commit to progressivelylowering their dose of kratom\nand eventually coming offof kratom.So the general takeaway from\nall of that is if you can avoidtaking kratom, meaning if\nyou haven't taken it already,don't.And that reminds me of a\nvery important point, whicha guest on the Huberman\nlab podcast Dr. RobertMalenka who's an\nM.D. and Ph.D. He'smy colleague at Stanford\nSchool of Medicine.He's a world expert on the\nmechanisms underlying addictionand dopamine and\ndrug reinforcement,among many other things.What he said on the\npodcast is absolutely true,which is that it is impossible\nto get addicted to a substancethat you've never consumed.That might seem obvious but\nthink about that one again.It is impossible to get\naddicted to a substancethat you've never consumed.So I think the safest\nstatement to makeis if you have not\ntried kratom, youwould be wise to\navoid it because youstand a chance to\nbecome addicted to it.If, however, you\nare somebody that'saddicted to other\nforms of opioids,you absolutely should talk\nto your physician about thatand how to get off\nof those opioids.But there is evidence that\nsome people have used kratomto successfully wean themselves\noff the more potent formsof opioids that I\ntalked about, namelymorphine and hydrocodone,\nas well as a few others.Now if you're somebody\nwho already takes kratom,you need to be very thoughtful\nabout the dosage that you take.And you also need to be\nthoughtful about the factthat people differ dramatically\nin their response to opioids.This is oh so important,\nand people do nottalk about this enough.We hear, for instance, that, oh,\nif people are taking anywherefrom one to five grams, maybe\none to six grams of kratomper day, that's keeping\nit in the dosagerange for which people don't\ngenerally tend to get addicted,you'll hear things like that.And by the way, when I\nsay one to five or oneto six grams per\nday, I'm not talkingabout the individual compounds\nthat are present in kratom.There are a couple of\ndifferent plant alkaloidsI'll talk about in a moment\nthat are present in kratom.And these have different\neffects on the opioid system.So nowadays, some of the\ncompanies that sell kratom.And by the way, this is\nsold over the counteras a supplement.It does not require\na prescriptionto purchase, at least\nat this point in time,in the United States.Some of these products will have\na higher concentration of oneor the other\nalkaloids within themsuch that you can't\nreally compareone gram of one brand of kratom\nto one gram of another brandof kratom because they can\nhave wildly different levelsof these different alkaloids.And these different alkaloids\nhave wildly different impacton different aspects of\nyour brain and body biology.In particular, how much\nthey tend to impactthe so-called endogenous\nopioid system, OK.So when we talk\nabout dosages, wehave to keep this in\nthe back of our mind.And we have to keep in\nthe back of our mindthat there does seem to\nbe a subgroup of people.We don't know how big this\nsubgroup of people is,but we know it's not everyone,\nbut it's somewhere between 10and 40% of people seem\nto respond to opioidsin a particularly potent way.They really like them.And perhaps not surprisingly,\npeople outside of that categorydon't tend to like opioids.I can certainly say\nthat I am somebodywho, when I've been\nprescribed things like Vicodinor any other opioid\npost-surgery for pain,I hate taking those drugs.I absolutely hate it.I'd rather deal with the pain.They make me nauseous.They make me feel terrible.That said, I know\npeople who love opioids.It's like a natural fit for\ntheir chemistry in the sensethat it tends to\nevoke more euphoria.They just immediately\nlike the feeling.Some of you may remember the\nepisode of the Huberman Labpodcast that I\ndid about alcohol.And there, too, I discussed\nthe fact that about 8% to 10%of people who consume alcohol\nget an increased dopamineresponse to alcohol that's\nnot observed in other people.And that particular subgroup\nof people is very, very at riskfor developing\nalcohol use disorder,sometimes called alcoholism,\nbecause they can drink in a wayand they experience a high\nfrom drinking in a waythat other people simply\ndo not experience.Now like everybody else, if\nthey consume too much alcohol,they get drunk.So it's not about\nthe drunk effect,it's about the dopamine\nand other sortsof chemicals that are released\nin those people in responseto alcohol that other people\njust don't seem to experienceat the same level of potency.So again, with things like\nkratom and the other opioids,there's a category of people,\nand it's a much larger categoryof people, again 10% to 40%.We don't know exactly how many\nbecause the studies are notreally completed, and there\naren't enough of those studiesyet, unfortunately.But when those people\ntake an opioid,wow, oh, wow, do they like it.And those people, in particular,\nare very much at riskfor developing an\naddiction to opioids.And so those people, especially,\nshould never ever go nearkratom if they haven't.Or if they are\nalready taking kratom,these are the people\nthat are constantlyratcheting up their dose.These are the people that\ntell you no, I'm not addicted,but if you were to\nsay, hey, all right,well then let's do an experiment\nwhere you don't take kratomfor a week, those are going to\nbe the people that are suddenlygoing to get anxious about\nthe mere idea of that.I've also talked about\nthis in referenceto cannabis when I did an\nepisode about cannabis.Again I'm not putting\na blanket statement outthere about cannabis\nas being good or bad.On that episode, I\ntalked about the factthat cannabis does indeed\nhave various therapeutic uses.But that there are a\ngood number of peoplewho rely on cannabis\nfor anxiety controland other ways of modulating\ntheir brain chemistryand bodily chemistry such\nthat if you were to say,hey, are you\naddicted to cannabis?They'd say no, I don't\nhave to smoke cannabis.I don't have to take my edibles.But if you were to push\nthem a little bit and say,all right, well then,\nlet's do an experimentwhere you don't\nconsume any cannabisin any form for 10 days.They don't like the idea\nof that experiment at all.So much so that were they\nto run that experiment,they would experience a lot\nof the withdrawal symptomsassociated with addiction.So I can't, in good\nfaith, say that kratomis safe for everybody\nbecause it is simply not.Now is it safer than\nthe other opioids?And if so, why?Well, in order to\naddress that, let'stake a short glance at\nthe pharmacology of kratomand how it works in terms of\nits neurochemistry in the body.Now I'm going to keep\nthis pretty briefbecause, in the\nfuture, I'm goingto do an extended episode\nall about opioids,and I will include kratom\nin that conversation.But just to back up a little bit\nand discuss what opioids are.Opioids are compounds\nthat can activatethe so-called endogenous\nopioid system.All of us have within\nour brain and bodythe capacity to release\nour own opioids.That's right.You have opioids\nwithin your body.They are released from\nneurons, and they bindto so-called opioid receptors.Perhaps some of you have heard\nof the so-called runner's high.The runner's high\nis a euphoric state.It's a fairly mild euphoric\nstate in most cases.But it's a euphoric\nstate inducedby long-duration effort, a.k.a.the runner's high.The runner's high\nis just a phraseused to explain\nthat when we engagein long-duration\nrepetitive action effort,the body starts releasing these\nendogenous opioids they bindto receptors, and\nthey trigger thingslike analgesia,\nrelief from pain.They trigger mild euphoria.They tend to change\nour perceptionof the outside\nworld, make thingslook more beautiful, shiny.They give things a\nlittle bit of a sheen.What I just described\nis a mild versionof what people\nexperience when theytake something like morphine.When people take\nmorphine, there'sa more of a sedative\neffect, there'smore of a euphoric\neffect, and there'smore of a dreamlike effect.And again, it will\ndepend on dosage.Kratom and morphine,\nand hydrocodone allhave the property of acting\nlike the endogenous opioidsbut at much higher potency.When you bring them\ninto your system,they cross the\nblood-brain barrier.So they go into\nthe brain, and theybind to a number of\ndifferent opioid receptors.There's the mu-opioid receptor.By the way, these names all\nfollow Greek alphabet letters.So the mu-opioid receptor,\nthe kappa opioid receptor,there are a bunch\nof different ones.Kratom binds preferentially\nto the mu-opioid receptorand somewhat to the\nkappa opioid receptor.There's a big\nmisconception out there.A lot of people,\nespecially peoplewho are proponents\nof kratom, willsay no morphine and hydrocodone\nbind the mu-opioid receptor,whereas kratom binds the\nkappa opioid receptor.So it's a different compound.Very, very different.Not true.Not true.Kratom, morphine, and\nhydrocodone all bindto the mu-opioid receptor.And that's what's\nlargely responsiblefor its opioid-like effects.Especially when you get\nthe dosage up to a levelwhere you start getting the\nmild sedation, the analgesia,the pain relief.And keep in mind a lot of\npeople are taking kratombecause they want pain relief.And when that mu-opioid\nreceptor system is activated,it indirectly activates a lot\nof the reinforcement circuitryin the brain that relates\nto dopamine and serotonin.This is another area that\nwe'll go into in moredepth in the future.But there's been a\nlot of controversy.People saying, oh,\nyou know kratomdoesn't trigger the\ndopamine system,therefore, it's not addictive.But that is simply not true.It indirectly activates\nthe reinforcement circuitrythat includes both\ndopamine and serotonin.But its primary effect is to\nhit this mu-opioid receptorsystem that exists in a\nbunch of places in the brainbut mainly in the\nbrainstem in a structurecalled the periaqueductal\ngray nucleus, whichthen provides pain relief.It triggers a number of\ndifferent shifts in cognition.It's what creates that mild\neuphoria, et cetera, et cetera.Now how can we be so confident\nthat kratom is acting sosimilarly to hydrocodone\nand to morphine,albeit with lower potency?And the reason is\nif you give peoplea drug that blocks the\nmu-opioid receptor prior to themtaking kratom, they\ndon't experienceany of the classic\neffects of taking kratom.No euphoria, no\nanalgesia, no sedation.Even at the low dosages\nno mild stimulant effect.So we really have to look\nat kratom as an opioid, OK.That's just the honest truth.And if you're somebody who\ndoesn't like this messagebecause you like kratom,\nI'm not telling youthat you don't like kratom, I'm\ntelling you likely like kratombecause it's an opioid.So again, if you go online\nand you start asking questionsabout kratom, again, you're\ngoing to see these two camps.You're going to see\nthe kratom is terrible,it's addictive, it's\neverything bad camp.And then you're going to see the\nother camp out there very vocalas well, talking about how\nkratom helped them avoidother things that are worse.And this is an argument\nthat, frankly, Idon't think we want\nto lean on, right.The idea that substance A is\nnot as bad as substance B.And that making\nsubstance A unavailableis just going to send everyone\nrunning for substance B. That'sa weak argument, frankly.I heard this argument\naround cannabis.And by the way, I think pretty\nbalanced about cannabis.If you listen to the\nepisode I did on cannabis,I think you'll agree that\nI believe that cannabis hasits therapeutic applications.I also believe that young\npeople, especially young maleswith a predisposition\nto psychosis,should not be taking\nhigh-concentration THCcannabis.Because the data tell\nus they are alreadyat risk of psychosis, and they\nare at a much greater riskof psychosis if they do.So I think I'm pretty balanced\nabout the story on cannabis.But I often hear the\nargument oh cannabisisn't as bad as alcohol and,\ntherefore, cannabis is good.That's simply not rational.What we should be\nsaying is whether or notit's cannabis or\nalcohol or kratomor any substance for\nthat matter, whatare the potential benefits,\nwhat are the potential risks?And again, this is\nfar too much than wecan go into in this AMA.And we will go into in a\nfuture full-length episodeof the Huberman Lab podcast.But the other thing\nto really keep in mindis the lack of regulation\nover kratom supplements.Now as many of you\nknow, I am a fanof many, not all,\nbut many supplementsin certain conditions.I always say behavior is\nfirst, then nutrition.Then if and only if it's\nneeded, rely on supplementation.But supplementation\nis a big category.But when we're talking\nabout supplementsthat are opioid\ncompounds, I startto get nervous because\nof the high abusepotential and the high\naddiction potential of opioids.And kratom is included\nin that category.A couple of other key\nnotes about kratom.While death directly from\nkratom is fairly rare,it has happened.Now hydrocodone and morphine\nsuppress respiration.Actually, suppress breathing\nby way of a mechanismthat, if you're a listener\nof the Huberman Lab podcast,you know about.Which is the so-called\nphysiological sigh.Many of you have heard me talk\nabout the physiological sigh.Is something that you do\nvoluntarily the double Inhalethrough the nose and\nthen a long exhalein order to rapidly reduce\nyour level of stress.As far as we know,\nthat's the fastest wayto deliberately lower\nyour level of stress.But the physiological sigh\nwas discovered in the 1930sas a spontaneous\npattern of breathingthat occurs involuntarily\nin sleep in orderto reinflate the lungs\nand offload carbon dioxideand bring oxygen\nback into the systemon the subsequent breath.When I interviewed\nDr. Jack Feldman, whois a professor at University\nof California Los Angelesand really the pioneer of\nthe modern neuroscienceunderstanding of respiration,\nhe talked about some studiesin his laboratory that\nwere exploring whypeople die when taking opioids.This is a major issue associated\nwith the opioid crisis.And what he mentioned\nwas that the opioids bindto particular\nreceptors in the brainstem locations that generate\nphysiological sighs.So opioids, when taken as drugs,\nsuppress physiological sighingand do so during sleep.And lack of adequate\nrespiration,meaning people stop\nbreathing during sleep,is one of the primary\nreasons why peopledie when they take opioids.Now kratom is not known\nto suppress respirationwhen taken at low\nto moderate dosages.But when combined with\nany other opioids,and certainly when\ncombined with alcohol,it can suppress respiration.And while the data on\nthis are fairly scant,there is some evidence\nthat kratom-induced deathis caused by suppression\nof the respiration system.So again, death due\nto taking kratomat the dosages that\nare recommendedon most commercial\npackaging is fairly rare,although it has happened.It's unclear if it\nhappened because itwas taken in combination\nwith other compounds.That seems likely.But we can't forget\nthat a lot of peopleare taking kratom at much\nhigher dosages and, in fact,progressively higher\nand higher dosagesfrom these\nover-the-counter sources.And with increased dosage,\nthere is, yes, an increased riskof respiratory failure.So again, all of this\npoints to the factthat kratom is simply\nnot a benign substance.So if we're going\nto be very honest,the addictive potential\nof kratom is real.It is exacerbated for some\npeople compared to others,but it is real.It's very similarities to other\nmore potent forms of opioidsare what make it attractive\nfor some people whoare trying to come off those\nmore potent form of opioids.But the goal, of course,\nis to completely come offall opioids.And kratom itself can\nbe a bit of a trap.It can be a trap in\nthe sense that peoplewho have never\ntaken other opioidscan become addicted\nto kratom itself.That is absolutely\nclear that can happen.It has happened in a\ngreat number of people.It's also clear that kratom\ncan potentially be a trap.Notice I said potentially.Because if people are\ntrying to come offother more potent\nforms of opioidsand then they use\nkratom to do that,and then they're ratcheting\nup their dosage of kratom suchthat they're now matching the\nendogenous response to kratomin a way that doesn't really\ndistinguish from the effectsthat they were getting from\nmorphine and hydrocodone,well then they're just\nusing a different formof morphine and hydrocodone.And I'm sure that some\nof you are out theresaying that is ridiculous.You cannot compare the effects\nof kratom to the effectsof hydrocodone.But the potency is about\none-sixth of hydrocodone.And there are\npeople out there whoare just increasing and\nincreasing both the dosageand modifying the type\nof kratom that they'retaking so that they're\ngetting the kratom thathas a particularly high\nconcentration of oneof the alkaloids that hits that\nmu-opioid receptor hardest.And in doing so,\nsure, they're notgetting the pure\nhydrocodone effect,but they're getting\nreally close.So my advice would be, if\nyou haven't touched kratom,don't touch it at all, ever.If you are taking\nkratom, you needto take note of what\nwe just discussed.Thank you for joining\nfor the beginning"
