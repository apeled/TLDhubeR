            "text": "the four types of light that one needsto see every 24 hours for Optimal Healthand and when I say Optimal Health Ireally mean mental health and physicalhealth but we're going to talk aboutmental health mainly today in thispaper there's an absolutely beautifulevolutionary story whereby single cellorganisms all the way to humans dogsrabbits and everything in between haveat least two cone opson one thatresponds to short wavelength light AKAblue light and another one that respondsto longer wavelength light orange andred so your dogs have this we have thisand it's a comparison mechanism in thesecells of the eye these neurons of theeye they compare contrast between bluesand orange or sometimes blues and redsand pinks which are also all longwavelengthlight there are two times of day whenthe sky is enriched with Blues orangespinks and reds and that's low solarangle sunlight at Sunrise and in theevening these cells are uniquelyavailable to trigger the ex existence ofthose wavelengths of light early in theday and in the evening not in the middleof the day so these cells have these twocone photo pigments and they say howmuch blue light is there how much redlight is there or orange light and thesubtraction between those two triggersthe signal for them to fire the signaloff to the circadian clock of the brainand that's why I say look at low solarangle sunlight early in the day whatthat does is it what call it as phaseadvances the clock this can get a littleTechnical and we don't want to get tootechnical here but think about pushingyour kid on aswing the period of That Swing theduration of That Swing is a little bitlonger than 12 hours okay so when youstand closer to the kid so your kidswings back and you give it a pushyou're shortening the period rightyou're not allowing the swing to comeall the way up that's what happens whenyou look at morning sunlight you'readvancing your circadian clock translateto English or non- nerd speake you'remaking it such that you will want to goto bed a little bit earlier and wake upa little bit earlier the nextday in the evening when you view lowsolar angle sunlight so in the a theafternoon Setting Sun or evening SettingSun you do the exact opposite you'rephase delaying in the clock it's theequivalent of your kid being at the verytop of the of the Ark and so it's goneyou know maybe 12 and a half hour uh 12let's say 12 and a half hours is theduration of that swing and you run upand you push them from behind and givethem a little more push that's theequivalent of making yourself stay up alittle later and wake up a little laterthese two signals average so that yourclock stays stable You Don't Driftmeaning you're not waking up earlierevery single day or going to sleep laterevery single day this is why it'simportant to view low solar anglesunlight in the morning and again in theevening as often as possible and it'sdone by that readout of those two photopigments now middaysun which contains its bright light butyou see it as white light contains allof those wavelengths at equal intensityso the middle of the day is theso-called circadian Dead Zone in themiddle of the day bright light triggersthe activation of the of the other opsonthe melanopsin which increases moodincreases feelings of well-being hassome other consequences but you can'tshift your circadian clock by viewingthe sun in the middle of the day becauseit's in the Circadian Dead Zone it's theequivalent of pushing your kid on theswing when they're at the bottom of theArc you can get a little bit more butnot much and in biological terms you getnothing so this is why looking atsunlight in the middle of the day isgreat but it's not going to help anchoryour sleep wake cycle and if you thinkabout this is incredible right everyorganism from single cells to us hasthis mechanism to know when the sun isrising and when the Sun is setting andit's a color comparison mechanism whichtells us that actually color visionEvolved first not for pattern Vision notfor seeing beautiful sunsets andrecognizing that's beautiful orpaintings or things of that sort butrather for setting the circadian clocknow what if you only do one of theseEnders so what if you've got constantexposure to low Morning Light but yourjob prevents you from doing the same inthe evening or vice versa yeah a greatquestion better to get the Morning Lightbecause if if you have to pick betweenlow solar angle light earlier later inthe day and keep in mind if you miss aday no big deal it's a slow integrativemechanism average ing across theprevious two or 3 days but if you miss aday you'll want to get twice as muchlight in your eyes that next morning thereason it's better to do in the morningas opposed to the evening although bothwould be to do uh best would be to doboth excuse me is that most people aregetting some artificial light exposurein the evening anyway and here's theDiabolical thing your retina is veryinsensitive to light early in the dayyou need a lot of photons to triggerthis mechanism early in the day as theday goes on retinal sensitivityincreases and it takes very little lightto shift your circadian clock late inthe day keep in mind also that if you dosee afternoon and evening sunlightthere's a beautiful study published inscience science reports yes sciencereports two years ago showing that thatcan partially offset the negativeeffects of artificial light exposure atnight I think of this as your Netflixinoculation and the amount of melatoninsuppression from Nighttime lightexposure is haved by viewing evenSetting Sun now keep in mind you don'tneed to see The Sun Cross The Horizon itcan just be when it's low solar angle soyou're looking for those yellow blue orblue pink blue red contrast and oncloudy days believe it or not they'restill there just you don't perceive asmuch of it coming through so therereally so that's three things that weshould all strive to do view low solarangle sunlight early in the day viewsolar angle sunlight later in the dayand get as much bright light in our eyesas we safely can ideally from sunlightthroughout the dayand if you can't do that get perhapsinvest in one of these uh sad lightsalthough they can be a bit expensive Uthere are a couple companies that arestarting to design Sunrise simulatorsand evening simulators that are actuallygood that actually work um but right nowmy read is that aside from one companyout there which by the way I have norelationship to it's called the 20 lighttuo and that light bulb was developed bythe biologist at the University ofWashington who basically discovercovered these color opponent mechanismsum those lights are not particularlyexpensive but they'reum they do seem to work in fact theythey're the study that is emerging againunpublished data seems to indicate thatif you look at it for more than five orsix minutes it can induce a mildEuphoria that's how powerful thiscontrast is and what they did there inthat light I'll just tell you themechanism is they figured out that whenmost people look at low solar anglesunlight in the morning they're getting19 reversals of blue orange per secondso when you look at this light it lookslike a a barely flashing white light butit's reversals of orange and blue orangeand um and you know red and blue andit's happening so what what does theperson looking at it perceive um wellI've used one of these um it just lookslike a a flickering light and of coursethere's the always the potential of aplacebo effect but well that's what Iwas going to say is there a way tocontrol for that by having somethingthat looks the same to the user but ofcourse is not producing the same photoeffect yeah well they've done that withthe 10,000 Lux sad lamps and you andwhich most people use to try and IND doSunrise simulation in their home butkeep in in mind that Sunrise is givesyou this comparison of short and longwavelength light just a bright 10,000Lux light triggers one of the optionsthat that but it won't set yourcircadian clock so most of the sad lampsthat are out there are activating onlyone of the mechanisms in these cellsthat's relevant and not the one that'smost relevant so I'm excited about what20 is doing I think that um and again Ihave no relation to them except I knowthe biologists who did the work thatthat provide the mechanistic logic forthe that engineering I still think umwe're in the like the really like earlydays of this stuff what should be doneis to have this stuff built into yourlaptop right it should be built intoyour phone and hopefully it will be nowI mentioned this color contrast thing in"

            "text": "sunrise and sunset I mentioned thebright light throughout the day butthere's a fourth light stimulus thatturns out to be really important andthis will provide the segue into thepaper turns out that dark exposure atnight independent of light exposureduring the day is important for mentalhealth outcomes now most people thinkdark exposure how do I think about thatwell it is dark absence of light it'sthe absence of light but what this paperreally drives home is that people whomake it a point to get dark exposure atnight aka the absence of light at nightactually benefit even if they're notgetting enough sunlight during the dayand this is especially true for peoplewith certain mental health issues so Idon't think we can overstate the valueof PR of accurately timed light exposureto the eyes in the context of mentalhealth I think you know there's so muchdata by now I will say however that somepeople seem more resilient to theselight effects than others meaning somepeople you know also don't suffer fromjet lag too much some people can stay uplate get a lot of bright light exposurein the middle of the night and duringthe day they got their sunglasses on allday and they're in a great mood all thetime other people are more susceptiblethese sorts of things and we don't knowwhether or not gen polymorphisms underlythat I personally am very sensitive tosunlight in the sense that if I don'tget enough sunlight I don't feel wellafter a couple of days um but I'm lesssensitive to light exposure at night forinstance but I think it isperhaps this is a big statement but isperhaps the mostfundamental environmental stimulus forlevels of arousal and alertness whichcorrelate with all sorts of you knowneuromodulator and hormone outputs andum so none of this should come as anysurprise I will mention one last thingthere was a study published gosh over 10years ago now from Chuck iser Lab atHarvard Medical School is a phenomenallab exploring circadian human healthbehavior he's just considered a no pun aluminary in the field but there wasn't astudy that was in error where they hadpublished in Science magazine that lightshown behind the knee could shiftcircadian rhythms and that paper wasretracted um and a lot of people don'tknow that it was retracted lightexposure to the eyes is what's relevanthere and as far as we know the color ofone's eyes like Darkness or lightness ofone's eyes Bears no relevance on theirsensitivity to these types of mechanismsand on and on so so one question onecomment the question again is going backto the morning evening light and I spenda lot of time looking at those types ofskies for example just because of thenature of my hobbies great right becauseI'm always doing archery in the morningand rucking in the afternoon so it's notuncommon that I'm seeing both of thosehow relevant is it that the Sun be abovethe Horizon so for example um it beginsto get light about in 30 minutes beforesunrise and then you know right at so ifsunrises at7:30 first light is is 7 and then youknow sort of 7:15 to 7 uh 30 is actuallyquite bright I mean you can see anythingand everything and the same as true atSunset so does does that 30 minutes preor when sun is Beneath The Horizonconstitute part of that 10 minutes itdoes I mean in an ideal circumstanceyou'd get outside and see the sunriseevery day and you'd see the sunset everyday even on cloudy days some people likemyself wake up before the sun comes upin which and I get this question all thetime well in the absence of powers tomake the sunrise faster which I'm notaware anyone has certainly not me Ithink the best thing to do is simply toturn on as many Bright Lights as you canindoors to trigger that melanopsinmechanism if you want to be awake if youwant to stay asleep or sleepy then keepthem dim and then get outside once thesun is starting to come out some peoplewake up after the sun has risen right inwhich case get what you can and somepeople wake up 10 a.m. or noon in whichcase you can still get the bright lightexposure but but you won't shift yourcircadian clock now in the eveningespecially in the winter months it'simportant to look West and try and getsome sunlight in your eyes in theevening if you've ever gone into theclinic for instance at 2 o'clock in theafternoon after lunch you know and thenin the winter and then come out and it'sdark when you're walk into your car it'sa kind of eerie feeling that sort ofeerie feeling May correlate with thefact that you missed a signal your yourbrain is trying to orient your brain andbody in time and that's what all of thisis right it's trying to orient in timeand again some people are moresusceptible to that than others somepeople might like that um feeling of ohI went in when it was bright and I comeout when it's dark but the vast majorityof people feel better when they'regetting this morning and eveningsunlight exposure and this is especiallyimportant in kids all right this is oneof the things that you know this paperpoints out and their good data thatpeople are spending approximately 90% oftheir time indoors nowadays daytime timetime indoors and those indoorenvironments are simply not brightenough you think oh there's all thesebright lights and some people areputting blue blockers on in the middleof the day which is the worst thing youcould possibly do if you're going towear blue blockers and I don't thinkthey're necessary but if you're going towear them you'd want to wear them atnight and in the evening you don't needto wear blue blockers you just simplyshould dim the lights and ideally havelights that are set a little bit lowerin your environment which theScandinavians have been doing for a longtime so you know kill the overheadlights and don't obsess about brightlight exposure in the middle of thenight in fact for a long time I and someother people were saying oh you knoweven just a brief flash of light in themiddle of the night can you quash yourmelatonin that's true but the other timein which you're in the quote unquotecircadian dead zone is in the middle ofthe night you can't shift your circadianclock in the middle of the night but youknow all of this gets down to interweaving rhythms of light sensitivitytemperature hormone output cortisol it Imean there's a whole landscape ofcircadian biology this paper um whichwas published in

think the titleof this paper is terrible sorry folks atnature mental health because if one justread the title it sounds like day andnight light exposure associated withpsychiatric disorders right if this wereIf This Were a newspaper headline You'be like oh my goodness well what are yousupposed to do right but that's not theconclusion the conclusion is thatgetting a lot of sunlight exposureduring the day and getting a lot of darkexposure at night is immenselybeneficial for psychiatric health and ina number of ways now I'm not one tobring up another paper unannounced but Iwill say that this paper built off aprevious study entitled time spent inoutdoor light is associated with moodsleep and circadian rhythm relatedoutcomes and that was a cross-sectionallongitudinal study in400,000 biobank participants so this UKbiobank is an incredibly valuableresource and there are now multiplestudies establishing that one's patternof light exposure is extremely importantnow the previous study in400,000 participants basically nailedhome the idea that the more time youspend Outdoorsthe better your is your mood the betteris your sleep the better is therhythmicity of your sleep wake cyclesand on and on something that I thinkeven though people will say we've knownthat for thousands of years neededscientificsubstantiation this new studyessentially looked at the relativecontributions of daytime light exposureand nighttime dark exposure and they didthat on a background of it looking inparticular at people who had majordepressive disorder generalized anxietyPT SD bipolardisorder he here's the the basictakeaway and I'll I'll quote them hereand then I'll I'll tell you myinterpretation that here I'm quotingavoiding night at light and seekinglight during the day I love that wordseeking may be a simple and effectivenon-pharmacologic means for broadlyimproving mental health so that's apretty bold statement right and I lovethat they say seeking because it impliesthat people aren't reflexively gettingthe light exposure that they need thatthis needs to be a practice ice muchlike Zone 2 cardio or resistancetraining okay so so what did they do inthis study so basically they gathered up100,000 people or so it eventually waspaired down to about 86,000 participantsbecause some just didn't qualify ordidn't report their data back theyequipped them with accelerometers ontheir wrist and those wrist devices alsocould measure ambient light now that'snot a perfect tool because what you'dlove to do is measure ambient light atthe level the Eyes by the way willsomebody design an eyeglass frame thatchanges color when you've gottensufficient light from sunlight duringthe day and then and then at night is adifferent color and then if you'regetting too much light exposure will goto a different color frame this has tobe possible so that you don't have towonder if you got enough light duringtheday and of course if it's at the levelof the eyes then you know that's what'slanding at the eyes yeah and it's l imean that's what I was going to ask youabout that do these wrist based devicespotentially get covered by clothing andsome like turned you have your sleevesdown I have my sleeves up they had it onthe outside of the sleeve but they askedthat people just keep it on theirdominant hand it's not perfect but insome ways it's kind of nice that it'snot perfect we could turn thatdisadvantage into an advantage bythinking you know when the person is outand about they're not often lookingright at the sun you know if you'retalking to a colleague under an overhangfor instance so it's it's not perfectdirectionally it's directionally rightokay and then they had two hypothesestwo primary hypotheses one that greaterlight exposure in the day is associatedwith lower risk for psychiatricdisorders and two second hypothesesgreater light exposure at night isassociated with higher risk forpsychiatric disorders and poorer moodthis is oh so relevant for the way welive now people on screens and tabletsin the middle of the night okay thenthey collected information about howmuch light exposure people were gettingas well as their sleep and theiractivity and so on I should mention thiswas done in males and females it was aslightly older cohort than one is usedto seeing people in their 50s and 60sthey had psychiatric diagnosisinformation and then they divided peopleinto essentially two groups but they hada lower so a q1 and a Q2 a lower cortilethat meant people that were getting lessdaytime light as opposed to the thirdand fourth quartile more daytime lightthey also had a nighttime lightexposure evaluation and they had peoplewere in the low q1 and Q2 so thesepeople are getting less nighttime lifelight versus Q3 Q4 more nighttime lightnicely they also looked at sleepduration and they looked at photo periodmeaning how long the days were for thoseindividuals how active they were what 10hours a day 14 hours a day because themore active you are the more opportunityfor light exposure you have during theday or night for instance okay so itthey had I would say fairly completedata sets then and I'm just going tokind hit the top Contour of what theydid in each and sorry sleep durationsleep efficiency Etc was determined offthe accelerometer that's right as wellas self-report yeah not not ideal rightyou'd

powerof these models but you know as somebodywho thinks about the mechanistic aspectof all of this a lot but not somebodywho's ever run this type of study I'd bereally curious model one examined theunadjusted association between day andnighttime light exposure and psychiatricoutcome so just basically asking isthere a relationship between how muchlight you get it during during the dayand how much light you get at night andhow bad your or your depression is oranxiety is ETC looking at you know justa standard ratio of the probability thatyou have a certain symptom or set ofsymptoms versus you don't given acertain amount of light exposure modeltwo adjusted for the age of the persontheir sex andethnicity and photo period so theylooked at you know how long the dayswere in that given person's region oftheworld and then model three these peoplewere all in the UK or were they aroundthe world they were all in the UK as faras I know and then model three adjustedfor employment so employed versusunemployed which if you think about itis pretty important like you say well anunemployed person has a lot more time tocontrol these variables but an employedperson who's doing shift work does notright and they they Incorporatedinformation about employed versusunemployed physical activity which turnsout to be very important and then thingslike shift work etc and so these whatwhat we can say very safely is that theoutcomes with each of these models theresults were very similar so we don'twant to discard the differences betweenthose models entirely but in my read isin every figure of the paper it doesn'tseem like model one two or three differfrom one another in terms of totaloutcome yeah that's an unusual aspect ofthis paper so so these adjustments arevery standard right so that's this is aa classic uh tool that's used in mostepidemiology um because you don't haverandomization so once randomization isout the window you know you you're likeso for example the paper I'm going topresent is based on an RCT there will beno models it's just he the data rightyeah here they're asking people whatwhat do you do report back to us we'regoing to measure your light exposure butno one was assigned to any groups theyswapped there the the whatever quoteunquote controls arethere they're really not there it's justcomparisons between groups so what isinteresting to me uh is that as it'sexactly as you said and we'll make allthese figures available in addition tothe papers but um I mean there it's veryunusual that there's no differencebetween the unadjusted and the adjustedmodels and as you say there's probablytwo places out of you know 30 when youlook at all the different quartilecomparisons where you might Creep fromyou know statistically significant justout of it or just into it but yeah youcould simplify this figure twocompletely by just showing one of themodels and you would be you know getting95% of the information which is you knowI mean I think in one way thatsuggests that there's less dependency onthosevariables of course it still doesn'taddress probably the greatest questionquestion I have here which I'm surewe'll get to at some point as as youcontinue yeah so I'm very curious whatthat question is but I'll I'll I'llsuppress my curiosity for the moment youknow so if we look at figure two of thispaper and I realize a lot of people arelistening and and they're not able tolook at this although we have posted thefigures on the YouTube versions of thisuh just want to make clear what's goingon just for those that are listeningessentially what they're looking at iswhat they call the odds ratio which isthe probability of something happeningin one group vers divided by theprobability of something happening inanother group I guess would it by way ofexample be you know if you're going tolook at the odds ratio of you know theprobability of somebody getting lungcancer if they smoke versus probabilitysomebody getting lung cancer if theydon't smoke so odds ratios and Hazardratios are often confused they're verysimilar and odds ratios generally referto a lifetime exposure whereas a hazardratio is um defined over a specificperiod of time but the MTH is stilleffectively the same and uh using theexample you gave if you took the oddsratio of um you know death so let's talkall cause mortality for a smoker versusa nonsmoker and the answer were 1.78 I'mmaking that up but that's directionallycorrect 1.78 as an odds ratio meansthere's a78% chance greater of the outcome ofinterest in this case death by any causein the affected Group which would be thesmokers so odds ratio of two is 100% andodds ratio of three is 200% so the mathis take the number subtract one andthat's the percent you know figure twoof this paper is one of the keytake-homes they essentially look at theodds ratio of people who are in thelet's say that let's just look at thenighttime light exposure and just remindme Andrew CU and and everybody elsewatching the every one of these isshowing second third fourth as yourx-axis meaning they're all beingcompared to the first quartile that'sright and the first quartile is lowestlight exposure or highest light exposurelow well or well we have to umdifferentiate between day and nightthat's right okay so restate it sure souh if we look at you know what is yourrisk of a psychiatric challenge broadlyspeaking well panel a is is majordepressive disorder if you are in thesecond quartile third quartile or fourthquartile of nighttime light exposure sosecond being the least amount ofnighttime light exposure third beingmore nighttime light exposure and fourththe most nighttime light exposurerelative to the first quartile this isjust a stupid thing like if I were doingthis figure if you were doing this in alecture you know what you would do tomake it so easy you would draw arrows onit that say increasing light exposure atnight decreasing light exposure in theday it's the same information it justmakes it easier for the reader tounderstand absolutely but and maybe theteaching point I think is is for peoplewhen they review articles like don't beafraid to do that and just kind of likeoh I've got all over this exactly soit's like I I draw the arrow that'sincreasing light that's decreasing lightand that's how I can pay attention towhat's actually happening right and I'mactually in touch with the editorialstaff at nature at nature mental healthalthough they don't know that I'mcovering this paper until after thiscomes out you know I think one thingthat scientific journals really reallyneed to do is start making thereadability of the Articles better fornonex experts I mean chances are if youcan't understand a graph and this istrue for everybody chances are there's aproblem with the way it's presented yeahput it on them but then of course tryand parse it because um you know rarelyif ever is it all spelled out clearlybut anyway that's what we're trying todo here so yeah the way I would havedone is say second quartiles low amounts"

is that the probability ofhaving worse major depressive symptomslinearly increases as you go from thesecond to third to Fourth quartile somore nighttime light exposure worse foryou and there's a dose response if youwill of the effect now we can Marchthrough or describe figure two prettyquickly by saying the same thing is truenow just talking about nighttime lightexposure for generalized anxietydisorder so that's panel C bipolardisorder although the difference betweenthe second and the third quartile inbipolar disorder isn't as traumatic onceyou get up to the fourth quartilebipolar symptoms get much worse whenpeople are getting nighttime lightexposure I really want to emphasize thatpoint because they go on in thediscussion of this paper to reemphasizethat point several times in fact theysay that while light EXP exposure duringthe day of course we will go into thedata is beneficial for mental health forpeople with bipolar disorder it seemsthat light exposure at night isespecially problematic independent ofhow much sunlight they're getting duringthe day so your bipolar um in the personwith bipolar disorder who's strugglingwith either a manic or a depressiveepisode who's making a point to getsunlight during the day who's alsogetting light exposure at night ismaking their symptoms worse and keep inmind they they couldn't completelycontrol this but is largely independentof things like sleep duration so thatdoesn't necessarily mean that theperson's sleeping less although in a ina manic episode presumably they are it'sindependent of exercise it's independentof a bunch of other things because anyany logical person will hear this andsay okay well they're they G more lightat night because they're doing a bunchof other things but it's largelyindependent of those other thingslikewise the symptomology of PTSD getsfar worse with increasing light exposureat nightself harm really takes a a leap frombeing fairly I don't want to say minimalat the second and third quartile so lowand let's say medium I'm using some I'mtaking some Liberties here but low inmedium amounts of of artificial lightexposure at night than for people whoget quite a lot of nighttime lightexposure self harm goes up andprobability of Psych psychotic episodesgoes up or psychotic symptoms now what'snice is that thewhat's nice about the data is that theexact inverse is basically true fordaytime light exposure although notacross the board we can generally saythat for major depressive disordergeneralized anxiety bipolar symptomsthere it's a little more scattered PTSDand self harm the more daytime lightexposure ideally from sunlight becausethat's actually what's being measured inmost cases we could talk about how weknowthat is going to approximately linearlydrop the probability or the severity ofthese symptoms and we could just explainagain that the odds ratios now seem tobe going down so an odds ratio of 7 nowrefers to a 30% reduction in thevariable of interest here exactly nowthe The psychosis panel F which uhfocuses on psychosis I think is alsoworthmentioning in in a bit more detailthere's a fairly dramatic reduction inpsychotic symptoms as one gets moredaytime light exposure independent ofnighttime lightexposure there's a well-known phenomenoncalled ICU psychosis which is thatpeople come into the hospital for abroken leg or a car accident maybe theywere getting surgery from from Peterback when for something totallyindependent they're they're housed inthe hospital and as anyone who's everbeen in a hospital as a patient orvisitor knows the light in the lightingenvironment of the hospital isabsolutely dreadful for health justDreadful I mean people often complainabout the food in the cafeteria as beingunhealthy that's often not alwaystrue not always true but the lightingenvironments in hospitals is absolutelycounter especially especially in theIntensive Care Unit yeah right I thinkthe the Intensive Care Unit at Hopkinsthe main one the the main sucku didn'thave Windows people who who go into thehospital with with a brain injury or orwith a stroke or something I getcontacted all the time even though I'mnot a clinician what should I do for mykid my parent my I say get them near awindow and start to the best of yourabilities controlling their sleep wakecycle now often times there's there youknow nurses coming in and taking bloodtests and measuring pulses in the middleof the night that's disruptive therethere's bright light not just blue lightthat's disruptive it's noisy that'sdisruptive ICU psychosis is when nonpsychotic individuals start havingpsychotic episodes in the hospitalbecause of nighttime light exposure andin some cases lack of daytimesunlight we can can say that with somedegree of confidence because when thosepeople go home even though sometimestheir symptoms for what brought them tothe hospital in the first place getworse their psychosis goes away now andit's independent of medication so let'sjust be reallydirect there is a possibility that weare all socially jetlagged that we areall disrupting these mood regulationsymptoms systems excuse me by notgetting enough daytime light and bygetting too much nighttime light if wewant to look at just some of the bulletpoints of the takeaways and then Peterthank you you highlighted a few of thesebut can we just go

the there are afew that really stand out um and again Ilove this figure um I would have labeledit a little differently to make itcompletely userfriendly but neverthelessthe increasing light at night and theimpact ondepression let let me be reallytechnical in what I say and therelationship or correlation todepression is very strong um therelationship to light and self harm inthe upper cortile so when you take those25% of people with the most nighttimelight that relationship to self harm isinteresting and completely uncoupledfrom the other 75% that's interestingbut uncoupled you mean that at the lowerlevels of light exposure at night you'renot seeing an increase in self harm notwhat and then once you get to thatfourth quartile it's a big step it'slike a 30% greater risk of self yeah soit's totally flat the first second thirdquartile no different and then fourthbig jump um and then the the the inverserelationship right as light increasesduring the daytime you see thisreduction in self harm interesting thePTSD relationship based on nighttimelight and The psychosis relationshipbased on daytime light those are theones that really jumped out to me uh Ithink anxietyrelatively the you know less impressivehere and and bipolar disorder didn'tseem as strong right as well so I thinkthose those are the big ones that thatjumped out to me yeah I agree there'sAIT there's a bit more scatter ongeneralized anxiety and and the degreeof the sign the degree of significantchange is not is not as robust in otherwords getting a lot of daytime lightideally from sunlight is not necessarilygoing to reduce your levels of anxietygetting a lot of nighttime lightexposure is not increasing nighttimeanxiety that much although 20% you knowis is not nothing um for nighttime lightexposure but yeah where the psychosismajor major depression and self harm arereally you know they leap out actuallywe maybe we even just drill a little bitdeeper on major depression basicallywhen you go from the second to thirdquartile of nighttime light exposure somore than nighttime light exposure youbasically go from no significantincrease to almost almost a 20% increaseand then as you get up to the fourthquartile so the most nighttime lightexposure you're at about25% increase in major depressivesymptoms not that's no joke um and youknow and I think that I think that weyou know if we were to uh know we don'thave the data right here but if we wereto look at like standard SSRI treatmentfor major depression you know um peopledebate this pretty actively but um lightis is a very potent stimulus and thetiming of light is critical because onthe the inverse is also true as you getto the fourth quartile of daytime lightexposure you get about a 20% reductionin major depressive disorder what I likeabout a study like this is that it putsthe error bars so easy to see on thedata and why is that interesting well umthere's there's um there's a there's abelief that bigger is always better insample size and we often talk about thatthrough the lens of power analysis rightso how many subjects do we need to um toto reach a conclusion that is powered toyou know this level and that's that'strue but what I don't think getsdiscussed as often is the opposite ofthat which is what if you overpower astudy in other words what if the poweranalysis says to be uh to have a levelof power at 90% you need a th000subjects and you Sayre we're going to do10,000 subjects well you're clearlypowered for it but you might beoverpowered and people might say wellwhy would that be a bad thing it couldbe a bad thing because it means you arevery likely to reach statisticalsignificance in things that might not beactually significant and so one thingabout this study that is just a quickback like kind of a quick and dirty wayto tell that it's probably notoverpowered is that you have varyinglengths of error bars and what thattells me is that and again this is notlike a formal statistical analysis it'sjust kind of like a back of the envelopestatistical analysis if you look forexample at self harm in the top quartileyou actually have pretty big error barsin fact all the self harm have sort ofslightly bigger error bars and yet whenyou look at for example the depressioneven though the a bars aren't all thesame size they're tighter in fact whenyou look at the relationship betweendepression and daytime light the airbars are really really small so thatjust gives me confidence that there isvariability in this which paradoxicallyyou kind of want to see because it tellsme that this wasn't just done you knowthere was I think you said 8,000subjects were in this and I realized 8more than 86,000 86,000 sorry yeah yourealize that it wasn't that oh thisshould have been done with a tenth ofthat or a half of that and we're pickingup um signal that is statisticallyrelevant but clinically irrelevant yeahthanks for for that point that I didn'tpay attention to that um I mean I paidattention to the air bars but I didn'tknow that um so thank you I'm learningtoo and I I suppose for people that arelistening we can just give them a senseof what the error bar ranges are forself harm you know they're running youknow as much as 20% either side of thethe mean the average and for majordepression it looks like it's more likelet's say 8 to 10% if if that if thatmaybe like five right so um yeah I seewhat you're saying so when you get a a avery large sample size you're going tohave some outliers in there and you canmask those outliers just by having somany data points right yeah becausethese error bars directly tell youwhether or not your statisticallysignificant so what's really nice aboutthis type of graph and you see these inthere's going to be a graph in my paperwhere you see the same analysis umthey're always drawing the 95%confidence interval on the on the datapoint and if the 95% confidence intervaldoes not touch the the line of unitywhich in this case is the the the thehods ratio of 1.0 or the x-axis then youknow it's statistically significant tothe confidence interval they've definedwhich is almost assuredly 95% sometimesthey'll make it tighter at 99 and sothat's why you can just look right atthese and go oh look you know indepression the second quartile didn'treach statistical significance becausethe error bars are touching the linejust as the case for the second andthird quartile for self harm but whenyou look at the fourth quartile you cansee that the lower tip of the error barsisn't anywhere near Unity and so we knowwithout having to look up the P valuethat it's uh smaller than either 05 or0.1 however they've defined it and it'sreally amazing when you see these youknow overpowered studies which areeasier to do epidemiologically where youknow the P value ends up beingmicroscopic you know they can they candrive their P values down to anythinglow because sample size can be infinitebut you know you can see that it's justlike the the error bar is just skimmingabove the uh the the unity line but it'sso so so tight I'd like to take a quickbreak to acknowledge our sponsor element"

becausehere what I again what I like about thestudy is that they've separated day andnighttime lightexposure turns out that many of thedrugs that are used to treat bipolardisorder reduce the Sens are areeffective perhaps in part because theyreduce the sensitivity of the lightsensing circadian apparati now that'sinteresting right if if you think aboutthis okay so these are drugs that canameliorate some of the symptoms ofbipolar perhaps in part by reducing theextent to which nighttime light exposurecan relieve bipolar symptoms can excuseme can exacerbate bipolarsymptoms conversely there's evidencethat people who take take certainanti-depressants May suppress theability for daytime light to positivelyimpact the mood systems of the brain nowof course we don't want people haltingtheir medication on the basis of thatstatement alone please don't you knowtalk to your psychiatrist but if we knowone thing for sure it's that if you wanta significant outcome and a paper as ascientist give a drug any drug and lookat the amount of rapid eye movementsleep or the Circadian cycle pretty muchany drug Alters the Circadianrhythm for better or worse but if westart to think about which medicationsmight adjust our overall sensitivity tolight sometimes this could be a goodthing you think less sensitivity tolight well for people who have bipolardisorder the amount of daytime lightexposure isn't that important for theiroverall mood regulation but the amountof nighttime light exposure really is inother words Darkness for eight hoursevery night should be viewed in myopinion as a treatment for bipolardisorder not the only treatment but it'salso clear that we should all beavoiding really bright extensive reallybright nighttime light exposure I meanif if anything you know my take awayfrom this study is that Darkness atnight is the fourth key light stimulusnow a couple of things very brightMoonlight very bright candle light isprobably onlylike gosh three to 50 lucks what whenyou go outside on a brightly lit fullmoon night I encourage people todownload this free app I have norelationship to it called light meterand it gives you a pretty good read ofwhat the lucks are in that environmentby the way a lot of people don't realizethis they think you just tap the buttonand then it tells you how many lucks youhold it down it's kind of fun you canscan around the room and see how manylucks are on average coming from thatlocation or outside go out on a reallybright moonl night I mean we we shouldhave a full moon tonight yeah let's doit you're not going to get above a 100Lux that's incredible you're sitting ata candlelight dinner with your spouse orwith friends and it's clearly brightenough to see them put that lux meterright up not too close to the flame 50to 200 Lux i i 4 interesting experiencea couple of months ago on an elk huntwhere it was a full moon which actuallymakes the hunting not so great but itwas the first time I've ever noticed myshadow in relation to the Moon uh that'show bright it seemed the light was thisis Halloween appropriate since we'recoming out we we're recording this closeto Halloween it's remarkable superinteresting to think it could be thatdim campfire you know and Fire Light youthink okay gathering around a campfirethen okay you know everyone circadianrhythm must have been disrupted for agesbefore the development of of electricelectricity no no that th thosecampfires are extremely bright butthey're they're they're not they're notthat bright compared to a very denselyovercast day and what is is your phoneif you don't use any sort of uh lightmitigating uh Tech on it well distancematters um at the distance we're holdingit yeah with so with all the thewavelengths cranked up so no uh there isa nice feature intrinsic to the phonewhere you can eliminate the blues atnight or you know this kind of thing butif you crank it up to maximum lightintensity probably something like youknow 500 to 1,000 Lux now keep in mindthough it's additive right so it's overtime so Lux is a measure of I think Ithink it relates back to Candelas it'sthe amount of light um shown at I thinkit's like the the one meter away andthere's a squaring and a falling off ofdistance we can look it up um these areold measurement old school measurementsconverted to Lux but keep in mind thatif you're looking at your phone ortablet at 800 Lux or 500 Lux in theevening you do that for 2 hours wellyou're summing quite a lot of photonsnow it is true and I I I I do want to befair to the biology uh and it'd bedishonest to say anything different youknow we we've hammered on people aboutnot shifting their circadian rhythm withlight at night but we know that themiddle of the day and the middle of thenight are circadian dead zones you can'tshift your circadian rhythm that well inthe middle of the day and the middle ofthe night but you can provide a wakeupsignal for for your body and brain it'sreally that sunrise and sunset that arecritical that's why I said there arefour things see sunrise or sunrising youdon't need to see across the HorizonSunset bright light during the dayminimize light exposure at night and youdon't need Pitch Black

andhe was like unacceptable you know whatI'm talking about unacceptableaccommodations what did he do he removedall the lighting that existed in thatroom and replaced it with red lightbulbs which I later used when I stayedhere and then later stole when Ileft the teenage me I took them I tookhim that's why Derek when he stayed herelane or anyone else when he stayed hereCony or anyone else didn't have those Itook them I love them so funny Jill islike you know Rick changed every lightin the guest house to Red I'm like yeahno I didn't know that but I'm notsurprised yeah well in his place he hasmostly either no lighting or redlighting so during the day he just goesby ambient light um and then red lightin the evening and or candle light andit's great and you know people hear redlights and they think they have to buythese expensive red light units that'snot what we're talking about that youcan literally buy red party lights orjust a red bulb some people say well canI just use a red film or can I put at-shirt over the lamp I worry aboutpeople putting t-shirts over lampbecause of the fire hazard um but I'llbe honest I dim the lights in my home atnight um when I travel sometimes I

are going to be the inevitableallnighters due to God forbid a Hos tripto the hospital or you heard somethingon the news that really amped you up oryou just simply can't sleep that stuffis going to happen so I think the goalshould be to minimize light exposure atnight and I think what you just said isespecially true because we don't knowfor instance people talk about thenegative impact of social media is itthe fact that people are looking at thislittle box for so many hours per day isit all the things they're not doing isit what they're looking at per se all ofthose things interact and are reallyimportant I we know based on studiesfrom the Stanford sleep lab that if youwake up in the middle of the nightlooking at what time it is can be verydisruptive to your ability to fall backasleep and to your sense the next dayit's just a placebo effect but it's apowerful one of how tired you are thenext day they've done this where theywake people up in the middle of thenight and then they say it's you know4:00 a.m. versus 2: a.m. versus 6:00a.m. and people's perceived levels ofenergy during the day in some wayscorrelate with what they think how muchsleep they think they got likewise andthis is one of the concerns potentialconcerns with sleep trackers yep AliCrum talked about this when she came onour podcast you know if people see apoor sleep score they often feel worsethan if they see a good sleep score nowof course physiology matters you can'tlie to yourself and say you you know gota great night of sleep simply by virtueof a sleep score but I worry more aboutthe thefalse well I if it's a false negativethat we don't want to put veilance onthis seeing a bad sleep score and thendeciding that you're going to have aterrible day you know I think a badsleep score is an indication that youmight need to dial some things in a bitbetter getting a great sleep score is anindication that you might be doing anumber of things right and start lookingat these things as averaging wouldn'twould you agree yeah completely I I I Idon't think it's that different from CGMright like I think that CGM is anamazing tool to provide insight and youpretty much know the insights after arelatively short period of time 30 daysmaybe at the outside 90 for for a reallyper for a person with a very complicatedlife um and you know all you need toknow about how the inputs affect theoutput thereafter if you choose to useit it's a behavioral tool in other wordsyou're using this to build in a Hawthorneffect I think the same is largely truewith sleep trackers um most people havethis profound sense of learning whenthey first encounter one of these thingsand and it's again you've heard it all100 times oh my God I can't believe whatalcohol does to my sleep right orcaloric trackers exactly like I think alane Norton's app carbon I have noFinancial relationship to it I use it orand it's taught me wow like I consume alot of calories in the form of certainthings at certain times of day andthere's just a lot of good learning inthat but it's the Act of tracking thathelps you manage it and similarly Ithink it's the act of knowing you'regoing to be looking at that score thatgamifies it that kind of helps people dothe right things oh you know what I'mnot going to have that drink tonight orI'm not going to eat that snack beforebed because I've now been conditioned tosee how that impact score that said Ithink that um you know recovery scoresand things like that are justnotoriously poor at predictingperformance and I think there's a reasonthat serious athletes would never usethings like that um they would tend torely on the more tried and true methodsof predicting Behavior such as heartrate uh maybe heart rate variability butmorning resting heart rate

demonstrate very tightcorrelations very strong associationsespecially in the five areas that wehighlighted umbut it's possible that part of whatwe'reseeing um is reverse causality broughton by both the treatments which you'vealready kind of alluded to and also thecondition itself do you want to explainreverse causality for people and maybecould you mention um for those thatmissed uh the Hawthorne effect just yeahyeah the the Hawthorne effect uh is isis an effect that is named after youknow an observation of what took placein a factory where they were actuallystudying worker productivity with lightof all things um but what refers to isthe idea that people will change theirbehavior when they are observed so if umif I said well I really want to knowwhat a day in the life is like forAndrew huberman I'm going to follow himaround for a day it's very unlikely thathis behavior that day will be exactly asit was if I wasn't there re why youprobably will never see a day in thelife of Andrew huberman although it'spretty it's pretty scripted unless I'mtraveling it's a it's a you know it'smorning sunlight hydration and you knowsome cardio or weight training and thena lot of time reading papers it'd be themost boring video in the world becausemostly me reading and underlining thingsbut it's why um gamifying things can bebeneficial right it's why a CGM can canbe beneficial because it's sort of likesomebody's watching you and you're goingto modify what you eat in response to itor why tracking can really be aneffective way to reduce input becauseyou there's a sense of being monitoredby doing that especially if someoneliterally monitors it in other words youcan set up an accountability partnerwhere your health coach or someone isactually seeing the data so that's whatit is now as far as reverse causalitywhen you look at variables soum let's just pick u a common one that'sunrelated to this so there there's anassociation that more diet sodaconsumption is associated with greaterobesity it's a bit paradoxical right umis that true it is yeah it's it's beendemonstrated in many series that the thethe greater the consumption of diet sodathe greater the prevalence of obesityand that has been postulated by some tosuggest that non-nutritive sweetenerssuch as aspartame or sucrose or thingslike that are actually part of what'scausingobesity um and while while there areprobably some arguments you could makearound the impact that those thingsmight have on the gut microbiome andmaybe there's some way and that'shappening it's also equally likely ifnot probably more likely that there'sreverse causality there that a personwho is obese is therefore contemplatinghow much they're eating or thinking heywhat's an easy way that I can reducecalories how about instead of drinking aCoke I drink a Diet Coke and so therethe causality which you would impute tomean the drink is causing the Obesity itmight be no the Obesity is causing thechoice of drink so here the question isum how much of the effect we're seeingis a result of the condition that'sbeing studied right how much of thedisruption in both day and night ex uhlight exposure is the result of thedepression it's disregulated the sleepmaybe they sleeping more during the dayand more awake at night because ofdepression again these are you can'tknow this this is where epidemiologynever allows us to determine this andsadly these questions can only beanswered through either directrandomization or mandelian randomizationwhich by the way I was going to also askyou do you know if anyone has examinedthis from a mandelian standpoint thatwould be that would be very interestingbecause I have tobelieve well it would be interesting Idon't know enough about the biology toknow what Snips would be studi but thatwould be interesting what Peter issaying is you know if you knew somethingabout the genomes of thesepeople um you would be in a greatposition to perhaps even link up lightsusceptibility genes or light lightsensitivity genes with genes for youknow Pathways involved in majordepression bipolar I mean get getting tothis issue of reverse causality I mean Ithink it's very straightforward toimagine that the person who'sexperiencing a manic episode is going tobe up for two weeks at a time um sadlyand getting a lot of nighttime lightexposure you know now dark nighttimedark exposure as a treatment for bipolaris something that people are starting totalk about so making sure that eventhose people are awake that they're atleast blue blocking at night um reducingtheir online activities but people withsevere manic episodes have a hard timeregulating their own behavior of courseand it's not one or the other like Idon't want the question to come acrossto

were 100 to zeroyou would say the light is 100% causalin the effects we're seeing if it werezero to 100 you'd say nope the behavioris 100% causal of the exposure to lightwhere do you again you can't know it butwhat does your intuition tell you okaythere's my intuition and then there's myrecognition of my own bias um becauseyou know I started working on thesecircadian Pathways origin in the eyeback in year in 98 as a graduate studentat Berkeley the the cells these melanopsand intrinsically sensive retinalgangling cells were discovered in theearly 2000s by a guy named Iggyprovencio Dave Bon Sam hatar sain pantaand others but and it was like one ofthe most important discoveries in all ofbiology clearly um so I've been veryexcited about systems but if I set thataside so um bias disclosuremade I think 65 to75% of the effects are likely due tolight directly now it's impossible totease those apart as you mentioned butto play Devil's Advocate against myselfyou know you could imagine that thedepressed individual is laying aroundindoors with the curtains drawn theydidn't sleep well the night before whichgives you a photo sensitivity that isn'tPleasant like it sucks to have brightlight in your eyes first thing in themorning if you especially if especiallyif you didn't sleep well and thenthey're you know making their coffee ina dimly lit what they think is brightlylit environment and then they're youknow looking at their phone and the thestate of the world sucks and their stateof their internal landscape is rough andthey're maybe they're dealing with apain or or you know injury or somethingand their likelihood of getting outsideis is low and when they do get outsidethey're going to shuffle and not youknow so I could see how the behaviorscould really limit the amount of oflight exposure and then evening rollsaround they've been tired all day and acommon symptom of depression you fallasleep and then 2 or three in themorning they're wide awake what are yougoing to do at two or three when you'reWide Awake sit in the dark no you'regoing to get online you're going tolisten to things you might have I'm notrecommending this but a alcoholic drinkin order to try and fall asleep I meanthis is the pattern and so you knowshaking up that pattern is really whatwhat what so much of my publichealth work these days is about andtrying to get people onto a more naturaldaylight night uh night dark Rhythm uhbut yeah it's impossible to tease apartwe do know this and this is uh reallyserious we know that in almost everyinstance EV almost every Psychopathologyreport ofsuicide in the weeks but especially inthe days preceding suicide that person'scircadian rhythms looked almost invertedfrom the normalpatterns and that's true of nonbipolarindividuals as well you know circadiandisruption and disruption in psychiatricHealth areinextricable conversely positive moodand affect and and circadian Behaviorseem very correlated I mean I think umit's clear that if you want to become anearly riser get light in your eyes andget activity in your body early in theday you you built that you entrained tothose rhythms so that you start toanticipate that morning workout youstart to anticipate the morning sunlightjust one um more scientific point weknow that when you view bright brightsunlight in the morning or just sunlightthat's illuminating your environment asyou said you don't even have to see thesun itself that there's a 55 z% increasein the amplitude of the morning cortisolSpike which is a good thing right that'swhen you want it because it's inverselythe amplitude of the morning cortisolspike is inversely related to theamplitude of the evening cortisol Spikeand high evening cour is law isassociated with middle of the nightwaking and on and on so um you know I'mvery bullish on these mechanisms I alsolove that they're so deeply woven intoour evolutionary history you know thatwe share with single cell organisms it'sso wild um but of course there's goingto be a bidirectionality there and it'sit's impossible to see where one thingstarts and the other one stops I meanhere's my take Andrew first of all I Iactually with far less Authority thanyou um agree with your assessment andmight even be a little bit more bullishmight even put it at 8020 and and hereI'll I'll give you my explanations whichuh stem more from my fastidious battleswith epidemiology in general right likebecause so much of the world that I livein still has to rely on epidemiologicdata and so how do you make sense of itand the truth of it is most of it isreally pretty bad um but I I tend tofind myself looking at the AustinBradford Hill criteria all the time andfor folks who don't know um he was astatistician who basically proposed aset of criteria U believe there areeight of them and I can't believe Idon't know every one of them off byheart I certainly used to um but themore of these criteria that are metwithin your correlations the morelikelihood uh you will find causality sowhen I think of your data here the datain this paper I'll tell you what makesthese correlations seem to havecausality within them in the directionthat's beingproposed um look at the dose effect sodose effect matters and this is done inquartiles and that's a very elegantthing if they just did it as on off itwould be harder high low that's rightbut the fact that they done in quartilesallows you to see that every example infigure two I don't believe there is anexception to this no and I think also inthe in the other there's only oneexception to what I'm about to say sorrytwo out of like God knows how manythey're all monotonically increasing anddecreasing in other words the doseeffect is always present another thingis biologic plausibility you've spokenat length about that today so in otherwords sometimes you have to look atepidemiology and ask is there a biologicexplanation and here there is you'veadded another one which is evolutionaryconservation to the biologicplausibility then you can talk aboutanimal models or experiments in humansover short durationsthat generally support these findingsand and so those are just a couple ofthe the Bradford Hill criteria that thatlead to um you know my belief that yeahthere's reverse causality here but umit's not the full explanation and thatmore of the explanation is probably thedirection that's being proposed um andif that's true because then at the endof the day like what's the purpose ofthe discussion the purpose of thediscussion is if you are under theinfluence of any of these psychiatricconditions in addition to the treatmentsyou're doing now what else can you doand to me the takeaway is follow theselight behaviors I mean it's it's it's athat's a relatively low lift when youconsider some of the other things likeI'm over here asking people to do Zone 2for three hours a week and VO2 maxworkouts and all this other stuff andlike I think all those things matter formental health as much as physical healthbut this strikes me as on the spectrumof lowasks if it shows if it's only even 30%causality 70% reverse causality likeI'll take those I I would still instatethat yeah and it's you know it's takingyour coffee on the balcony it's andpeople will often say well how do you dothis with kids the kids should be doingit too right you know it means poppingyour sunglasses off it means getting outfor just a few minutes and the fact thatit's additive that these you know thesePhoton uh mechanis Photon countingmechanisms they some is great and lookthis paper also says and I should havestated this earlier if you missed yourdaytime light ration get your nighttimedark ration they are independent andadditive so that's I mean that's areally

immediates are the incompatibilities but you know thethe sort of next layer ofincompatibility was MHC incompatibilitywhich would lead to you know withinwithin weeks the organ is gone asopposed to within hours so you havethese two classes of MHC you have classone and class two class one is what wecallendogenous so this is basically whathappens when a protein or an antigen iscoming from inside the cell so let'sconsider the flu so if you get the fluthe influen a virus infects therespiratory epithelium of your uh youknow your larynx and that virus as youknow folks listening might remember fromour days of talking about covid virusescan't replicate on their own what theydo is they hijack the replication umMachinery of the host and they use thateither to insert their RNA or DNA toreplicate and in the process proteinsare being made well those proteins arethe proteins of the virus not of us sosome of those peptides get launched ontothese MH class MHC class one uh glovebasically the glove comes up to thesurface and a te- cell comes along andin the case of MHC class one it's a cd8t- cell these are what are called thekiller te- cells right and so this cellcomes along and with its t- cellreceptor the te- cell receptor meets theMHC class one receptor with the antigenin it and if that's a lock it realizesthat's my Target and it begins toreplicate and proliferate and Targetthose and that creates the immuneresponse and by the way that's how itworks when you vaccinate somebody you'rebasically pre-building that thing up sowould this fall under the Adaptiveimmune response or the innate immuneresponse though this is adaptive yepinnate is just the pure antibodyresponse in the on the B cell side Iwon't get into that for for for thepurpose of this discussion the otherexample is MHC class two and that's alsopart of the Adaptive system or theinnate system which uh is more what wecall the um exogenous form so these arepeptides that are usually coming fromoutside the cell so we're going to focusmore on the MHC class one because thisis peptides that come from inside thecell okay so just keep in the back ofyour mind if a foreign protein getspresented from inside a cell to outsidea cell the te- cells recognize that andthey will mount a foreign response andby the way that's why we basically canbeat any virus like if you consider howmany viruses are around us the fact thatwe almost never die from a viralinfection is a remarkable achievement ofhow well this immune system works we'reconstantly combating these virusesconstantly and by the way we don'treally have very effective antiviralagents it's not like antibiotics like wehave antibiotics up to Wazoo I meanwe're way better at fighting virusesthan bacteria can I just one questionI've always wondered about this to whatis our ability to ward off viruses on aday-to basis as anadult reliant on us having been exposedto that virus during development likelike as I walk around today maybe I'llbe exposed to 100, different viruseswould you say that half of those I'vealready got antibodies too because I Iwas exposed to them at some priorportion of my life yeah hard quantifyand the other ones I'm just building upantibodies like I was on I was on aplane last night someone was coughing soI was hiding I had Co a little while agoso I wasn't too worried about that and Ifeel great today but youknow I just assume that on that planeI'm in a swamp of viruses no matter whatand that most of them I've already beenexposed to since I was a little kid soI've got all the antibodies and they'rejust fighting it back binding up thoseviruses and and and destroying them yeahI think it's part that and I also thinkit's part of them that our body candestroy without mounting much of animmune response so therefore your immunesystem is doing work and it's yet it'snot mounting a systemic inflammatoryresponse that you're not sensing so isit also a physical trapping in you knowin my nasal epithelium it's a virus yeahso so yeah let like there you have hugebarriers right so the skin you know thehairs in your nose all of these thingsare huge barriers but assuming thatstill a bunch of them are getting in atleast the respiratory ones that's theother thing to keep in mind right thereare certain viruses that are totallyuseless floating around the air rightthere are certain viruses you know theviruses that most people are reallyafraid of you know Hep C hepb HIV wellyou know if they're sitting on a tableor floating around the air they're of nothreat to you they have to be you knowsort of transmitted through the barrierum but again some of these virusesyou're going to defeat without anenormous response and then some of themyou know like why is influenza quoteunquote such a bad virus whereas thecommon respiratory cold kind ofSidelines you for a day it's the immuneresponse that you're feeling the worsethe bigger the immune response to thevirus the more you're feeling that youfeel your immune system going crazyright you know the in lucans that arespiking the third spacing that occurs toget more and more of the immune cellsthere the spike of your temperature asyour body basically tries to cook thevirus all of that stuff is your bodyyeah yeah you're being drained and allthis happeningso um one more point I'll mention just"

            "text": "but just to close the loop on theautoimmunity um how is it that we learnnot to attack ourselves that's somethingcalled thymic selection that occurs ininfancy so you and I have a no good fornothing tiny little thymus that would beit's almost impossible to see thesethings you know when we used to operateon people you know the thymus is barelyvisible in an adult in a healthy adultoutside of thymic tumors but as a CH ina child the thymus is quite large andthe purpose of the thymus is to educatete- cells and basically show the te-cells what self isand any te- cell that doesn'timmediately recognize it gets killed soit's it's a really clever system wherewe basically teach you to recognize selfat a very early age and if you can't dothat you're weeded out and then thethymus involutes thereafter because it'ssort of served its purpose okay nowlet's talk about cancer so what do weknow about cancer so we know that againyou know cancer is a genetic disease inthe sense that every Cancer has geneticmutations um most of those mutations aresematic which means most of thosemutations are mutations that occurduring the course of our life they'renot germline mutations the germlinebeing the uh eggs and sperm right soit's all other cells and I love that youpointed out that you know there can begen that cancer can be genetic but isn'tnecessarily inherited right peoplegenetic and they think inherited rightbut inherited is always genetic to someextent but um genetic isn't alwaysinherited yeah so there are a handful ofcancers that are uh derived frominherited mutations so Lynch syndrome isan example of that uh hereditarypolyposis is an example of that whereyou have a gene that gets passed throughthe germ line and that Gene codes for aprotein like all genes do and it'seither you have too much of a gene ortoo little of of a gene so it's either agene that promotes cancer or and youhave too much of that or it's a genethat prevents cancer and you have toolittle of it or a dysfunctional versionof it right so braa is an example ofthat braa is hereditary braa codes for aprotein and the the women and men butmostly the women that we think about whohave a braa mutation that all in somecases almost guarantees breast cancerit's because of a defective copy so it'slike they don't get the protein thatthey need to protect them from breastcancer so what do we know well we knowthat and this is probably one of themost remarkable things I've ever learnedand it still blows my mind every time umwell actually before I get to that pointI want to make I want to make anotherPoint okay so so you might think socancer we we you know our cells becomecancerous but they're clearly hijackedbecause they have these mutations and asa result of these mutations they makeprotein prots that allow cancers tobehave differently and Cancers behavedifferently from non-cancer in two verycritical ways the first way is that theydo not respond to cell cycle signalingso if you cut your skin it heals but howdoes it know to heal just right and notto keep growing and growing and growingand growing and growing well it knowsthat because there are cell cyclesignals that tell it time to grow timeto stop if believe it or not this is anextreme example if you donated to mehalf of your liver which I know youwould absolutely i' give you more thanhalf my you give if it meant that wecould keep doing these dral clubs rightum within months you would regenerate afull liver that's so isn't that amazingthat's so wow it's like a salamander youcut off a salamander Limb and pleasedon't do that experiment because otherpeople are doing it anyway and it growsback and it knows how much to grow backit's so wild so so when a cell isperfectly functioning it knows how muchto grow and and it's well cancer losesthat ability that is one of theHallmarks of cancer it just keepsgrowing it doesn't grow faster by theway that's a misnomer people thinkcancers grow faster than non-cancerthere's no real evidence that that's thecase they just don't stop growing thesecond property of cancer is thecapacity to leave the site of origin gosomeplace else and take up residence sothat's metastasis that's the metastasiscomponent so if you think about it for aminute a cell that never stopsreplicating and has the capacity to upand leave and move and take up residenceis clearly different from the cellitself right so if I have a cell ofcolonic epithelium the cell that linesthe inside of my colon it's clearly gota set of proteins in it but if all of asudden that thing can grow grow growgrow grow not stop not stop not notlisten to the signal and then somehowwind its way into the liver and justkeep growing and growing and growing itmust have different proteins so thequestion question then becomes why doescancer even exist how has our immunesystem not figured out a way to justsilence this and eradicate it the way itdoes to virtually every virus youencounter and to me this is one of themost interesting questions in all ofbiology and it really comes down to howclever cancer is unfortunately howevolutionarily clever it is it basicallydoes a lot of things to trick the immunesystem so it has its own secretoryfactors that Tamp down the immune systemit grows in an environment because ofits nature so one of the things that'slong understood about cancer is it'sheavily glycolytic and when something isheavily glycolytic it's going glucose topyruvate to lactate nonstop there arelots of reasons for that um I thinkthere's more than one the what does thatafford it ises that a does that affordit a migratory potential no so it'ssuper interesting so so that's theeffect what I just described is calledthe warberg effect and when warbergproposed this uh which God was probablyin the1920s it was before World War I beforeWorld War II um he proposed it be hethought the mitochondria of cancer cellswere defective so he proposed that theyou know cancer cells mitochondria don'twork hence they have to undergoglycolysis they can't undergo uh aerobicum uh metabolismum we now know that that's not the caseso we now know that the the the warbergeffect or the varberg effect if I'llrefer to him correctly by his name umalmost assuredly does not have to dowith defective mitochondria others haveproposed several mechanisms I thinkthere's probably more than one thinggoing on so so so a paper that came outin 2009 very influential paper um by aguy named Matt vanderheiden and um CraigThompson and uh Luke kley proposed thatthe reason that cancer cells do thewarberg effect is that they're notoptimizing for energy they're optimizingfor cellular building blocks and if youdo the mass balance it completely makessense like dividing cells need buildingblocks more than energy and glycolysiswhile very inefficient for generatingATP is much more efficient at generatingsubstrate to make more cells but anotherproposed mechanism is exactly at thisone glycolysis lowers the surrounding pHbecause of lactate lactate attractshydrogen pH goes down and guess whatthat does to the immune system detractsthe immune system so it's also a way tohide from the immune system so there's alike a pH cloaking use leveraging pH tocloak the the signal that the immunesystem would otherwise see yep and thenwhen you layer on top of that that itknows how to secrete things like il10TGF beta all of these other secretoryfactors that also inhibit the immunesystem basically it's figured out a wayto kind of hide itself from the immunesystem the way you describe it cansounds like a virus yes I mean it soundsa lot like a virus and that leads me toask are there any examples of contagiouscancers I recall seeing some studiesabout these little critters down in uhuh Australia Tasmanian devils that likethey would uh they scratch each other infight as Tasmanian devils do they'reactually quite cute um and they wouldget cancers and tumors growing on theirfaces yes so so it and so it was it waslike it was like a literal physicalinteraction that could transmit cancerfrom one animal to the next so it's lessthat there are viruses that cause cancerso in that sense you could argue yesthere are contagious cancers well HPVsure yeah HPV hepb uh hepc uh but butthere are even cancers like cutaneouscancers that arise from viruses but um Idon't know if that's quite the same aswhat you're saying like no no it'sthey're both it what you're saying is animportant point I mean uh we don't wantto go down the the round a whole of ofHPV but right that's increasingsusceptibility to cervical cancer um nowthere's a vaccine against HPV rightthere wasn't when we were in college aswe all knew um there was no vaccine butthe um okay so but yeah directtransmission of cancers from one oneorganism to the next more rare yes okayso now here a moment ago I said there's"

organ tumorsbecause that's where the field ofoncology has made very little progressso if you go back 50 years where hasoncology made huge progress it's madegreat progress in uh blood tumorsleukemias and some kinds of lymphomas infact there's two kinds of lymphomaswhere the progress has been remarkableone has been in uh Hodgkins lymphoma andthe other has also been in immunotherapyhas been in a type of B cell lymphoma umwhere that B cell demonstrates uh orpresents something called a cd19receptor so in in in B cell lymphomaswith cd19 imuno there's a very uniqueNiche immunotherapy we won't talk aboutthat today called car therapy that hasgot rid of those guys and then leukemiashave also been pretty good but in solidorgantumors there have been only two realbreakthroughs in the last 50 years onehas been the therapy for a certain typeof IC cancer um and it's really just achemotherapy cocktail that has beenfound to work really well and the otherhas been in this really rare kind ofgastric cancer called The Gist stromaltumor which happens to result from onemutation in a kise pathway and there'sone drug that can now Target that and itworks it's kind of amazing cures thatcancer cures that what I'm talking aboutare the cancers that kill virtuallyeverybody else this is what when yousort of line up what are the big causesof cancer deathlet's start at the top it's lung it'sthen breast and prostate in men andwomen it's coloral it's pancreas thoseare the big five they kill more than 50%of Americans it cancer- wise not sorrylet me restate that more than 50% ofcancer deaths in Americans come fromthose five these are what we call thesolid epithelial tumors and you canMarch down the list and most cancersthat most people are thinking of arethose cancers well here's the thing morethan 80% of thosecancers have antigens that arerecognized by the host's immune system Iwill state it again because it is soprofound 80% at least of those cancersactually generate an antigen meaning alittle peptide in that cell getspresented to the te- cell and it isrecognizable and now the question is whyis that not sufficient to induceremission and the short answer isthere are not enough te- cells that areable to act and or they are beingsufficiently inhibited from acting whichgets me to the point of this paper oneof the ways in which the body inhibitsthe immune system which we should remindourselves is an important thing right issomething called the checkpointinhibitor okay so go back to that ideathat I talked about before you have anantigen presenting cell it brings up anMHC receptor with a peptide on it andthere is a t- cell that is coming and Iactually brought a diagram which we'regoing to I'm going to link to this CU II don't want to make this toocomplicated but I really think that thisfigure is helpful to understand howthese papers uh how these drugs work sothe MHC receptor with the peptide issitting there and it binds to the T t-Cell receptor on the t- cell but thereis another receptor on the t- cell actla4receptor and that binds to a receptorthat I won't bother naming now becauseit's the the the names don't matter butthere's another receptor on the antigenpresenting cell that binds to that andthat acts as the breaks in the reactionsoctla4 which is on the t- cell binds toanother CD receptor on the antigenpresenting cell and it says Tamp downtheresponse and the reason for that is wewant to keep our immune system in checkthis basically is a way of asking theimmune system because remember when theimmune system sees that antigen it wantsto go nuts it wants to start replicatingand killing that this is a cd8 cell itis a targeted killer t- cell thecheckpoint says let's double check thatlet's be sure let's Tamp down theresponse and as a result of that athought experiment emerged which waswhat if we blockctla4 what if we block the checkpointcould we unleash the immune system alittle bit more and I will say this atthe time it was proposed it seemed a bitfar-fetchedum because of the complexity of theimmune system it seemed a littlefar-fetched that simply blocking thecheckpoint would have anyeffect it's also worth noting that priorto this one immunotherapy had found someefficacy which was trying the exactopposite strategy rather than blockingthe inhibitor it was throwing moreaccelerant at the fire which was givingsomething called inter Lucin 2 sointerlukin 2 is for lack of a betterword candy and fuel for te- cells so theidea was if we have te- cells thatinnately recognize a cancer antigen canwe just give high doses of interlukin 2and have them undergo proliferation andresponse and the answer turned out to beyes but only in two cancers melanoma andkidney cancer and only at very smalllevels about 10% of the population wouldrespond to these things now look that's10% of people who were going to be deadwithin 6 months because these aredevastating Cancers and once they spreadthere are no treatments that have anyefficacy whatsoever in fact I thinkmedia and survival for metast melanom atthe time was probably 4 months so thiswas a very Grim death sentence um butthe idea now was what about doing theexact opposite approach instead oftrying to throw more uh fire at the t-cell what if we can take its breaks downless gas pardon me instead of givingmore gas let's give lessbreaks and um there were some

clinicalpapers like this table one is alwaysalways always Baselinecharacteristics um oh I should mentionone other thing Andrew this was done asa 3: one: onerandomization so again in the simplestform a study would have two groups rightyou would have um we're going to justhave a treatment group and a placebogroup but in this arm you had threegroups with one of them being the placePlacebo the placebo got just GP 100which is just a cancer vaccine by theway this is a cancer vaccine that nevershowed any efficacy so it was a cancervaccine that had been tested both withinterlukin 2 directly and um as an adantfor patients who had metastatic melanomaor had sorry not metastatic melanoma whohad melanoma reected who were tumor freeand then given the vaccine as adant tosee did that have an effect on outcomesand it didn't so it's kind of a knownPlacebo so you had that group then youhad the antict 4 group and then you hadantict 4 plus GP 100 yeah what's therationale for the 3:1: one it'sbasically it increases statistical powerright so you know this total study was alittle under 700 people they put 400 inthe anti-la 4 plus gp1 100 group andthen you you know little over 130 ineach of the other two groups so you'realways going to be able to make thesetwo comparisons right what you can checkby doing this is is there any effectiveGP 100 in this setting which had neverbeen done before so again GP 100 is aknown protein expressed bymelanoma and all of these people werehaplotyped to make sure that theirimmune system would recognize it and thequestion was would giving peopleanti C4 I.E taking the breaks off theirimmune system with or without gp00 makea difference so kind of going throughthis you can see it sort of skews about60% to 40% male to female they talkabout something called the ecogperformance status that refers to howhealthy a patient is coming in so ecogzero is no limitations whatsoever whichis kind of amazing when you reallyconsider something I think this speaksto just how devastating this disease isum these are patients who all have like6 months to live right you know a yearMax and yet look at this 58 to 60% ofthem have no limitation on their qualityof life at this very moment that's goingto change dramatically um you knowabsent a cure here and then ecog 1 hassome limitation and you can see that EOG1 plus ecog 0 is basically 98% of thepopulation you can see the staging thereso again very very few of these patientsare the m0 category zeros are people whohave stage three disease that is soaggressive it can't be reected that'sabout 1% but the majority of thesepeople are the m1as M1 BS M1 C's sothese are people with very aggressivecancers you can also see that about 10to 15% of these people also have CNSmetastases again the poorest prognosisof the poor and then you can see the uhabout 40% of them have the LDH levelabove above cut off all of this is tosay we're talking about a group ofpatients who have um you know a veryhigh likelihood of notsurviving more than you know a year itwould be very you know unlikely thatthat many of these patients wouldsurvive more than a year so so basicallyMore than 70% of these people havevisceral metastasis uh a third have highLDH and 10 more than 10% have brain Metsthey've also all progressed throughstandard therapy so um radiation chemoyeah and the chemo for for for melanomacan be you know kind of a toxic chemothat that really just doesn't really doanything so is it common place to use atreatment that failed in clinical trialsas a placebo in these sorts of studiesyeah it's interesting I I think you'rereferring obviously to the GP 100 and Ithink the thing thinkingwas okay it hasn't been effective inother treatments for example whencombined with I2 or as an adant butnever before has it been tried with acheckpoint inhibitor which is thetechnical term for this type ofdrug um I think there was also somebelief that it would be easier to enrollpatients I don't think they stated thisbut that's often the case it would beeasier to enroll patients if they wouldknow that even in the placebo armthey're still getting an active agentgot it and I suppose there's always thepossibility that the combination of theuh failed drug with a new drug wouldwork and then so you're increasing theprobability for novel Discovery for sureand again if you go back to therandomization of 3 to one: one it'sreally only 1 or 20% of the participantsthat would get just the GP 100 so inother words you're basically tellingpeople when they come into this studythere's an 80% chance you're going toget antict 4 that's a much better set ofodds than you know your typical studywhere you're going to be 50% likely toget the uh agent of Interest right andpeople who areliterally dying of cancer that they Wthey don't want to be in the controlgroup right that's right so the primaryoutcome for this study actually changed"

familiar to peoplewho look at you know any data that dealwith survival it's called a Kaplan Meyersurvival curve so on the xaxis for thiscurve is timeand time here is shown in months and onthe Y AIS is the overall survival at thevery top 100% at the bottom0% and it has three graphs or threecurves that are superimposed on oneanother for each of the three groupsagain the control group which is the GP100 the um anti-la 4 Group by itself andthe ntla 4 plus GP 100 and one of thecharacteristics of a Kaplan Meyer curveis by definition they have to bedecreasing in a monotonic fashionbecause it's cumulative overall survivalthat just means it can't like come downand go back up nobody comes back to lifeso once a person dies they are censoredfrom the study and the curve drops anddrops and drops and you can see thatthey kind of highlight and I actuallythink it makes the graph a little harderto read when they when they put some ofthose marks on there but what reallybecomes clear when you look at this isis that there's a key there's a cleardistinction between the curve for theplacebo group the gp00 group and theother two the two treatment groups nowyou'll note at the very end that the twotreatment groups appear to separate alittle bit I'll talk about that in asecond so when I look at these Andrew Ithe first thing I always turned myattention to I can't resist I have tolook at the right hand side of the graphcuz what is that really telling me rightthat the tale of this is showing me thetrue overallsurvival and I want to sort of figureout what is going on so in the GP 100Group which is the placebo group it iskind of amazing to think that there isstill one person who is alive at 44months it's it's amazing I mean it'sboth sobering and amazing that like oneperson made it to 44 months um the nextthing I ask myself is well how long didhalf of the people make it that's calledmedian survival and to do that you go upto the Y AIS and you draw a little linefrom the 50 over and then you bring thatdown and and that's you know that'sthat's that's awfully low that's aboutyeah in fact the table will tell usexactly what that is because I thinkit's really hard to eyeball that stuffso let's go to so there's always a tablethat will accompany these things andlet's pull up that table I've got thispaper spread out over so many thingslet's Adverse Events where's oursurvival table here figure two subgroupanalysis of overallsurvival it would probably be helpful ifI stapled these things together becauseit would be EAS well this is always atrade-off actually for since this is ajournal Club episode I I will say thatstapling helps but it also prevents onefrom separating things out writing inthe margin I like these little miniclips no Financial relationship to themini clips either um just have to statethat cuz I always get if you don't saythat people go oh you must have a steakin these mini clips I like these littlemini clips in fact I'm such a nerd Ialways have one of these uh pilot V5 v7sin my Pock on my pocket of my hip andthen my pockets are always filled withum with these little mini clips and umbut then again I have a friend who's amusician he's and he's always reigningguitar picks so you know it's an as faras occupational hazards go of being anerd I'm a big fan of the mini clip aswell but I I went without it today allright so thank you yes table two allright so so let's look at table twowhile looking at the Kaplan Meer curvebecause now this allows us to see acouple things by the way remember how Isaid there's like that one person whokind of is still alive in the treatmentgroup well you can tell that he's not acomplete responder he or she is not acomplete responder because um underevaluation of therapy in table two itsays best overall response and it sayscomplete responders zero so there wasZero complete responders in the placebothere were two partial responders againa partial responder is um some lesionsgot smaller some got bigger stabledisease is it didn't really change thatmuch and Progressive disease isobviously it went beyond not when yousay partial response like lesions gotsmaller are they literally just tracingthe the circumference of one of theseyou know skin lesions and saying okaygot bigger smaller you literally we' hadrulers iny yep yep feels this feels socrude in terms of like like I mean itmakes total sense but like in terms oflike modern medicine oh like your lesionGrew From like 3 millimeters to 6 millimand that we literally like drawinglittle boundaries around little blotcheson the skin yeah you're you're putting alittle measuring tape on them now againmost of these are happening in theRadiology Suite because most of thedisease for these patients is inside thebody body remember More than 70% ofthese patients had visceral metastasesso liver soft tissue uh lung brain youknow these are in fact if you includelung liver brain and viscera it's it'sall the pretty much all the patients somost of this is looking at a CT scan oran MRI for the brain got it um okay sothat's that's kind of the first thing"

            "text": "that comes up the median response rateshould should be shown prettyprominently here so I'm looking throughthrough thisand where is medianresponse maybe it's shown in a differenttable uh let'ssee not Disease Control rate time to[Music]progression I remember it's about 10months but maybe that's just in thetext yeah here it is so I thought thiswould be in a table but it's uh it's onpage 75 of the paper it just reports itso and I'm sorry I misspoke um the 10months was for the antict 4 plusgp00 and 6.4 months for the GP100 alonethat's the control and then 10.1 for thentla 4 alone okay so again I always andagain I'm just always doing this I'mkind of going back to the paper to belike does that make sense and yeah youkind of called it right you said mediansurvival was about eight well it turnsout it's actually like six and changebecause cuz it has that little ding init and it's out to a little past 10 onthe two others so the net takeaway hereis again just to put that in Englishbecause it's soprofound 50% of the patients in thecontrol group were dead in 6months 50% of the patients in thetreatment group both treatment groupswere dead in 10 months so what thatmeans in cancer speak isthese drugs extended median Survival byfourmonths now that's a that's an importantconcept you know when we think about howhas cancer therapy changed over the past50 years median survival for metastaticcancer has increased across the board soa person today with metastatic coloralcancer or woman today with metastaticbreast cancer or a person withmetastatic lung cancer these people willlive longer with those diseases todaythanks mostly to treatments this is notan early detection lead time bias issuethis is treatments are allowing peopleto live longer and that's an importantpart of the story but it's only half ofthe story yet it often gets touted asthe story the other half of the storyand frankly the story that I think ismore important is what is overallsurvival doing and if you go back tothose answers the answer iszero so overall survival hasn't changedfor solid epithelial tumors it is it was0% in 1970 and it's 0% today everyonedies everyone dies from metastatic solidorgan tumors now again there's thosethere's those Niche examples I gave youtesticular cancer is now an exception umgomal tumors would be an exception andI'm not including leukemia and lymph FASwhere now there are exceptions okaywithin not to try and be overlyoptimistic but if I look at the graph infigure one and I look out at the tail ofthe graph that's right um and for thosethat are just listening what I see andand I'm far less far less familiar withthis type of work and this analyzingthese type of data but what I see isthat people in the placebo group They'reAll Dead except that one Yep they'rebasically all dead at 44 months y butwhen I look at the number how long ittakes for everyone to be dead in thetrue treatment groups it's like 50 lookslike 53 54 months or so well and they'reand they're not dead that's the pointthey're hanging in there right sobecause you know an extra somebody whoum lost both of my uh scientificadvisers two of the three the other oneto Suicide we've talked about thisbefore but the other uh two to differentcancer both had the bracka 2 mutation bythe way um you know an extra 8 to 10months with your kids or with yourspouse or to quote unquote get yourAffairs in order is is a big deal I meanit's still depressing in the sense thatnobody survives long term but um youknow an extra 10 months as long as oneis not miserable in that time completelymiserable um I mean that's e extra 10months of living right well and andwhat's interesting here is you know theobservation period stops and some ofthese patients are still going so whatyou're highlighting is kind of the pointI want to make which is overall survivalis the most important metric and it'sthe highest bar make no mistake about itand it's certainly not the bar any drugcompany is ever going to want to talkabout for a cancer drug but why notbecause because they don't none of themwork right like we don't have you knowlike drug they only want to talk aboutcures they don't want to talk they onlywant to talk about media and survivalthey want they only want to talk aboutextending media in survival and you knowthere are you know lots of people outthere that are on this on this platformI don't need to get on to it but whowill say like look it's a real racket inin oncology today where drugs that areextending median Survival by four weeksare being put on the market at a tune ofyou know $50 to $100,000 per treatmentthat's not uncommon in oncology uh therewas one drug that was approved forpancreatic cancer I believe it extendedmedian Survival by days and it cost$40,000 and it's being advertised assignificant extens because it was thatwas a statistical significantImprovement in media and survival I'mjust yeah so it's look it's reallyunderstandable why people are veryskeptical of the Pharma industry and andI think you know a much more nuancedview is necessary clearly I don't thinkPharma is all bad um but I reallyunderstand why people lose faith inPharma when when you know these types ofproducts somehow make regulatoryapproval does insurance cover thesekinds of drugs uh it can in fact itoften does it depends on the FDAapproval of course and the indication umbut a lot of times they do right so yeahthere's a societal cost to these thingsum but but there's also a patient costright so a lot of times insurancedoesn't fully cover it and a patient hasto Bear the the cost difference and ontop of that you alluded to this a secondago which is what if your quality oflife is dramatically compromised as aresult of this treatment and yesstatistically you're going to live 9days longer or 3 weeks longer but atwhat cost to your health in those finalremaining days and by the way you'repotentially straddling your loved oneswith enormous debt uh in your absence soit's it's a super complicated topic yeahthere's a dignity component too I meanI've seen this in people dying you knowat some point they become such a adiminished version of their formerselves that they don't want to be seenby people that way so what is excitingabout this drug although it's this paper"

little bit of time withthis and I I confess it it you know Idefinitely don't want cancer to theextent that I can avoid it but thistable made me wonder whether or not Iwould also want to just avoid cancertreatment given the life extensionprovided I mean these Adverse Events arepretty uncomfortable they sound just toput just to put in perspective um andyou always have to kind of you know bemindful of how many of these adverseevents are occurring in people justbecause their disease is progressing sothe first thing I always want to look atis total Adverse Events in all threegroups not just grade so grade three andgrade four are real toxicities rightgrade four toxicity is life-threateningtoxicity by the way uh grade three ispretty significant toxicity grade oneand two we typically just you knowthat's not that severe right the littlerash put some cortico steroids on it itwent away kind of thing okay so in theuh treatment plus GP 100 group 98 8.4%of people reported some event so all but1.6% in the ntct 4 group alone it was96.7% so only 3.1% did not but in theplacebo group it's 97% so it's importantto keep in mind like you knoweverybody's having some adverse effectokay well what if you say well let'sjust limit it to the most severe eventswell let's just talk about grade fourtoxicities there were 6.1% of those inthe placebo group8.4% in the anti ca4 group and6.8% in the combined group so not a hugedifference in grade four toxicitymeaning that whatever adverse events areoccurring may not be related to they maynot be related to the treatment theagain these are if you if you thinkabout it and it's a very awful sadmorbid thought to imagine these areyou're looking at the adverse responsesof people more than 80% of whom diedduring the course of a very very shortstudy and so you know it's verydifficult to disentangle what effects orwhat side effects a person is havingjust from that process uh as they arefrom the actual treatment but if thereis an area where there's a really cleardifference it's down in the autoimmunecategory so if you look at any immunerelated events you can see that in theanti C4 plus gp1 100 group it's about60%in both of those treatment groups versus30% and if you look at the grade threeand four toxicities it's 10% in the uhantict 415% in the um antict 4 alone group andonly 3% in the treatment so that's areal difference well it makes sense thatpeople getting thisdrug plus Placebo or just the drug wouldhave autoimmune issues because this isan immunotherapy it's an immunomodulatorin fact what is it doing it is takingthe breakes off the immune system butthen again the things that they listout puitis is that a irritation of theskin yeah irritation of the skin I'm nota physician but I know that any itis isgoing to be like an inflammation andunfortunately likely a cancer or cellreplication look at the difference inviigo I meanum wow yeah so very or sorry sorry lookat the gastro intestinal differencesyeah and the Vitiligo right so 3.7% 2.3%8% the GI stuff is the most common stuffyou're going to see there those arethose are the really big ones now and ofcourse there's diarrhea and there'sdiarrhea oh like there's travelerdiarrheathere's overly spicy large me4 diarrheaand then there's like can't really doanything besides make trips back andforth to the bathroom di well there'sthere's there's put it this way there'syou know colitis here is diarrhea sosignificant these patients require ireIV fluids now what what you don't seehere is how many of these patientsactually required corticosteroids toreverse the autoimmunity so a lot oftimes what will happen here in thesestudies or with these drugs is theautoimmunity becomes so significant thatyou have to stop the drug and givecortico steroids do the exact oppositeyou now have to shut the immune systemdown so you just took the brakes off itwith the drug and now you need to shutit down withcorticosteroidsum when I was was I in med school nowhen I was in my uh Fellowship um Iwrote a paper about um autoimmunitycorrelating with response rate in ncta 4uh early on this was during the phasetwo work so you so the NCI was a veryearly um uh uh adopter of Uparticipating in these trials and um youknow it was observed that or at leasthypothesize this is what the paperbasically wrote about which was is thereany correlation between autoimmunity andresponse um and it turned out the answerwas yes there was a very strongcorrelation so there was no differencein autoimmunity between the doses andthe so the paper we wrote was two dosingschedules so it was basically the fulldose the three milligrams per kilogramversus a low dose 1 milligram perkilogram this is a phase two trial thoseare your two arms they're turned out tono difference in autoimmunity betweenthem but there was a big differencebetween um uh the response rate thattied to autoimmunity in other wordsautoimmunity predicted response now Ithink over time these U investigatorsthe doctors

gets all of the attention inautoimmune condition in in um umimmunotherapy conditions I'll state thatbut um but anyway a friend of mine gotpancreatic cancer and he got um the badtype of pancreatic cancer so this is uhan like the um um adenocarcinoma in thepancreas right so this this is a anon-survivable type of cancerfurthermore his wasunresectable so can you explain whatthat is yeah so the only so about 20% ofpeople who have pancreatic cancertechnically have it in a way where youcould still take out the head of thepancreas right the Whipple procedure theWhipple procedure um now tragically mostof those patients will still recur myunderstanding it is that pancreaticcancer progresses from anterior toposterior in the pancreas and that theWhipple is a removal of the front endthe anterior that's the Whippleprocedure so if the cancer hasprogressed far enough coddle into theposterior uh pancreas then there'snothing left to cut out basically um canwe survive without a pancreas for anyamount of time oh yeah absolutely so whydon't they just remove the wholepancreas oh that's my point it's alreadymicrom metastized so it's not the thesurgical procedure is not the challengeanymore it used to be so you know atJohn's Hopkins which is one of thehospitals where this was pioneered likethe the 30-day mortality for a Whippleprocedure was I don't know80% and the reason was to figure out howto suture a pancreas to the bowelwithout the so so the pancreas is suchan awful organ to operate on because itsenzyme are designed to digest anythingand everything so imagine now you haveto cut the pancreas in half take out thehead of the pancreas with the duodenumand then somehow sew that open half of araw pancreas to the end of the junam andnot let it digest itself someone atHopkins figure this out um now the firstone was actually done by AO Whipple butyes at Hopkins is where they figured outthe way to put drains in the surgicaltechnique how to do it in two layerswhat type of stitches to use like all ofthe nuances of this were worked out in afew places but I would say Hopkins morethan any place else and are therePhysicians who like try this onnon-human primates or something or isthis always just done on patients andyou well nowadays I mean put it this wayeven 25 years ago at a at a at a majorCenter like Hopkins the the mortality ofthat procedure was less than 1% amazingyeah have been some victwell yes but here's my point it thatthat's no longer the bottleneck righttaking out the pancreas safely ascomplicated and challenging as that isand if you need a whip procedure youonly want to have it done by someone whojust does that night and day becauseit's you don't want Weekend Warriorsdoing it um that's not why people areliving or dying they're dying becausethe pan the cancer just comes back itwas already spread to the liver by thetime you did it you just didn't realizeit yet so whether you took out the wholepancreas or the head of the pancreas orthe tail of the pancreas the location ofthetumor is predictive of survival only inthe extent that it basically is a windowinto how soon did symptoms occur sopancreatic cancers in the tail tend tobe more fatal even though they're wayeasier surgically to take out because bythe time you develop symptoms of a tailpancreas cancer it's it's a big cancerso I was going to ask this question latlater but I'll just ask it now given thelink between the immune system and thesecancers is there an idea in mind thatpeople who are let's say 40 and older or50 and older who don't yet they're notdiagnosed with any cancer wouldperiodically just stimulate their immunesystem to wipe out whatever earlycancers might be cropping up you knowjust take a drug to just ramp up theimmune system even to the point whereyou're start having a little diarrheamaybe a few skin rashes and then comeoff the drug you know just basically toto fight back whatever little cellgrowths are starting to take place inskin or liver you know maybe for youknow three weeks out of each year I meanwhy not yeah that's an interestingquestion um I've never thought of itthrough that lens I suppose the questionis what can we do to keep our immunesystems as healthy as possible as we agebecause stay on a normal circadianschedule there's evidence for that sureno there's evidence that certainly if itpromotes sleep anything that promotesbetter rest is going to promote immuneHealth um because if you ask the macroquestion which is like why does theprevalence of cancer increase sodramatically with age um there arecertain diseases where it's reallyobvious why the prevalence of thedisease increases with age yeah like maclike uh age related macular degenerationsure or cardiovascular disease is by farthe most obvious because it's an areaunder the curve exposure problem themore exposure to lipoproteins and themore the endothelium gets damaged themore likely you are to accumulate plaqueand again it totally makes sense why10year olds don't have heart attacks and80y oldsdo but when you sort of acknowledge thatwell hey you know can't you knowanybody's Accu accumulating geneticmutations we're always surrounded andbeing bombarded by things that arealtering the Genome of our cell is itsimply a stochastic process where thelonger you live the more of thesemutations are going to occur until atsome point one of them just wins I I Ithink that's got to be a big part of itbut I think another part of it and Iclearly I'm not alone in thinking thisis that our immune system is gettingweaker and weaker as we age right I meanyou know we you know people become moresusceptible to infections as they getolder uh and I think that that's equallyplaying a role in our susceptibility tocancer so yeah I think the question ishow do you modulate immunityum as you age and to me that's one ofthe most interesting things about rapypotentially is that when taken the rightway it seems to enhance um cellularimmunity which again that that'spotentially a really big deal again atleast in in short-term human experimentsin response to vaccination it'senhancing vaccine response so thequestion is would that translate intocancer nobody knows could that be one ofthe reasons why animals treated with rapayin live longer and get less cancerdon't know you know it could also bethat it's it's at a fundamental levelthat's targeting nutrient sensing umwhere I was going with that story wasthat and maybe I'll back up for a momentwhy"

that if you just got them to becomfortable in a lower p pH it would besufficient because there are still somany other things that the uh cancer isdoing as far as using other secretingfactors um it seems that by far the mostpotent thing comes down to expanding thenumber of te- cells that recognize theantigen and making sure that you can getthat number big enough without agingthem too much so in some senses it hasbecome a long longevity problem of te-cells the way to think about itis you want an army of soldiers who arewise enough to recognize the bad guyswhich comes with age but young enough togo and kill and right now both extremesseem to be unhelpful right when you goand find tumor infiltrating lymphocytesin a tumor they're very wise they knowwhich one they've demonstrated that theycan do everything they can outmaneuverthe cancer but they're too old to doanything about it and when you take themout to try to expand them by three logswhich is typically what you need to doexpand them by a thousandfold they can'tdo anything got it and what aboutavoiding melanoma altogether I meanobviously avoiding sunburn you know Isomehow I got couched as anti-ssunscreen and that is absolutely nottrue I I said some sunscreens containthings that are clearly immune disruptuh endocrine excuse me disruptors andwe're going to do a whole episode onsunscreen maybe we could do some JournalI'm actually planning something on thatas well I want and some dermatologistsreached out um some very very skilleddermatologists reached out and said thatindeed some sunscreens are are downrightdangerous but of course melanoma issuper dangerous um physical barrier noone disputes physical barriers forsunscreen like everyone everyone agreesthat that is unlikely to have endrinedisruption um so physical barriers areUndisputed but aside from limiting Usunlight exposure to the skin umwhat are some other risks for melanoma Imean I think that's the biggest one I donot believe that smoking poses a riskfor melanoma and if it does it's goingto be very small um there are hereditarycases so one needs to be pretty mindfulwhen taking a family history and by theway there are really weird genetic umconditions that link melanoma to othercancers such as pancreatic cancer by theway so whenever I'm taking somebody'sfamily history and I hear about somebodythat had melanoma and someone that hadpancreatic cancer I'm there's a couplegenetics genetic tests we'll look at toto see if that's a person that'sparticularly sensitive just and a from agenetic predisposition um but I do thinkthat first and foremost it's and by theway I think with melanoma the althoughit's not completely agreed upon I thinkit's less about sun exposure and moreaboutsunburn right so so and again I'm surethere's somebody listening to this whowill chime in and apply a more nuancedresponse to that um but but I thinkthere's a there's a fundamentaldifference between I'm out in the sungetting Sun making some vitamin D versusI'm getting scorched and un you knowundergoing significant UV damage theremight also be something to be said forthe time in one's life and i' I'vecertainly seen things that suggest thatearly you know early repeated sunburnswould be more of a risk um so look I Ithink that's not a controversial pointin the sense that like who wants to besunburned right so it's like whateverone needs to do to be sunburned whetherit's you know you know being mindful ofwhat the UV index is wearing theappropriate cover wearing theappropriate sunscreen um I also find thewhole uh kind of anti-s sunscreenestablishment to be a little bit oddwell the anti sunscreen establishment isodd you know I'm trying to open the doorfor a Nuance discussion about you knowthe fact that some sunscreens really docontain things like oxy benzines andthings that are real and you're sprayingthem on kids you just look at thestraight you know the good oldfashionedmineral sunscreens um perfectly safeyeah yeah as far as we know I mean I Ialso uh dare we uh cross the seed oildebate into this some of the folks whoare really anti- seed oil also claimthat seed oils increase risk forsunscreen uh Peter and I are smilingbecause we we have teed up uh a debatesoon with some you know anti-ed oil andless anti-ed oil um experts so thatthat's forthcoming that's going to be afun one we'll be doing all of that withour shirtson I really appreciate you um walking usthrough this paper Peter I've neverlooked at a paper on cancer um andcertainly not one like this um I learneda lot and um it's such an interestingfield obviously because of theimportance of getting people with cancerto survive longer and Lead better livesbut also um because of the theinteraction with the immune system so welearned some really important immun olyeah and this was this was great I uh II feel much more confident now in the uhbelief that the the exposure to lightearly and late in the day can actuallyhave have benefits and I and as I said Ithink that there's I think there'sthere's some causality here and I thinkit shouldn't be ignored cool well thiswas our second Journal Club I lookforward to our third next time you'll gofirst we'll just keep alternating andwe've also switched venues but um weboth wore the the correct shirt uh andum I hope uh people are learning um andnot just learning the information butlearning how to parse and think aboutpapers and I certainly learned from youPeter thank you so much yeah thanksAndrew this is great thank you for"

    "episode_summary": "In this journal club episode, my guest is Dr. Peter Attia, M.D., a Stanford and Johns Hopkins-trained physician focusing on healthspan and lifespan and the host of The Drive podcast.\nWe each present a peer-reviewed scientific paper chosen because it contains novel, interesting, and actionable data. First, we discuss a paper on how bright light exposure at sunrise and throughout the day and dark exposure at night independently improve mental health and can offset some of the major symptoms of mental health disorders such as depression and anxiety. Then, we discuss an article that explores a novel class of immunotherapy treatments to combat cancer. We also discuss some of the new data on low-calorie sweeteners and if they are safe. This episode should be of interest to listeners curious about maximizing their vitality and longevity and to anyone seeking science-supported ways to improve mental health and lifespan.\nFor show notes, including referenced articles and additional resources, please visit hubermanlab.com.\nThank you to our sponsors\nAG1: https://drinkag1.com/huberman\nEight Sleep: https://www.eightsleep.com/huberman\nBetterHelp: https://betterhelp.com/huberman\nJoovv: https://joovv.com/huberman\nLMNT: https://drinklmnt.com/huberman\nMomentous: https://livemomentous.com/huberman"
