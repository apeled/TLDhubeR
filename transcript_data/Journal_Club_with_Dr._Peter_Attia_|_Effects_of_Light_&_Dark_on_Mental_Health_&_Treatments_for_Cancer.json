            "text": "number two I'm already confident this is going to become a regular for us I'm excited I really enjoy this because I get to pick papers I'm really excited about I get to hear papers that you're excited about and we get to um sharpen our skills at reading and sharing data and people listening can do that as well so last time I went first so uh I think I'm going to put you on the hot seat first and have uh have you go first and I'll follow you okay well I'm really excited about this paper um for a number of reasons first of all it at least by my read is a very powerful paper in the sense that it examined light exposure Behavior as well as dark exposure behavior and that's going to be an important point in more than 85,000 people as part of this um cohort in the UK um I'll just mention a couple of things to give people background and I'll keep this relatively brief first of all there's a longstanding interest in the relationship between light and mental health and physical health and we can throw up some very well agreed upon bullet points first of all there is such a thing as seasonal effect itive disorder it doesn't just impact people living at really Northern locations but basically there's a correlation between day length and mood and mental health such that for many people not all but for many people when days are longer in the spring and summer they feel better they report fewer depressive symptoms and conversely when days are shorter significantly more people report feeling lower mood and affect Okay so there's a long-standing treatment for Seasonal effective disorder which is to give people exposure to very bright light especially in the morning the way that that's normally accomplished is with these sad lamps Seasonal effective disorder lamps and those lamps are basically bright meaning more than 10,000 Lux lights that they place on their kitchen counter or at their table in the morning or in their office so they're getting a lot of bright light that is proven to be fairly effective for the treatment of Seasonal effective disorder what's less understood is how light exposure in the middle of the night can negatively impact mood and health and so where we are headed with this is that there seems to be based on the conclusions of this new study a powerful and independent role of both daytime light exposure and nighttime dark exposure for mental health now a couple of other key points the biological mechanisms for all this are really well established there's a set of cells in the neural retina which aligns the back of your eye they're sometimes called intrinsically photosensitive retinal gangan cells they're sometimes called melanopsin retinal gangion cells we'll talk about those in a bit of detail in a moment it's well known that those cells are the ones that respond to two different types of light input not one but two different types of light input and send information to the hypothalamus where your master circadian clock resides and then your master circadian clock sends out secretory signals so peptides hormones but also neural signals to the brain and body and say hey now it's daytime now it's nighttime be awake be asleep but it goes way beyond that these melanops and intrinsically photosensitive retinal gangling cells we know also project areas of the brain like the habenula which can trigger negative affect negative mood they can trigger the release of dopamine or the suppression of dopamine the release of serot in the suppression of do of Serotonin and so they're not just cells for setting your circadian clock they also have a direct line literally one synapse away into the structures of the brain that we know powerfully control mood so so the mechanistic basis for all this is there so there's just a couple of other key points to understand for "

            "text": "people to really be able to digest the data in this paper fully there are basically two types of stimula that these cells respond to one is very bright light as we just talked about that's why getting a lot of daytime sunlight is correlated with elevated mood that's why looking at a 10,000 Lux artificial lamp can offset Seasonal effective disorder by the way just a couple questions on that um how many Lux does the sun provide on a sunny day at noon okay great question so if you're out in the sun with no cloud cover or minimal cloud cover in the middle of the day at noon chances are it's over 100,000 luck on a really bright day could be 300,000 Lux okay most indoor environments even though they might seem very bright I like to think of your you're kind of like uh department store with the bright lights believe it or not that's probably only closer to 6,000 Lux maximum and probably more like 4,000 Lux most brightly lit indoor environments are not that bright when it comes down to Total Photon energy now here's the interesting thing on a cloudy day when you're outside it can be as bright as or an average of a 100,000 Lux but it won't seem that bright because you don't quote unquote see the Sun but it's also because when there's cloud cover a lot of those long wavelength of light such as orange and red light aren't coming through however and this is so important the circadian clock the supermatic nucleus it sums photons it's a photon summing system so basically if you're outside in 8,000 Lux very overcast UK winter day and you're walking around hopefully without sunglasses because sunglasses are going to filter a lot of those photons out your circadian clock is summing the photons so it's an integration mechanism it's not triggered in a moment and actually the the experiments of recording from these cells first done by David buron at Brown were you know historic in the field of visual Neuroscience when shown bro bright light on these intrinsically photosensitive cells you could crank up the intensity of the light and the neurons would ramp up their membrane potential and then start spiking firing action potential long trains of action potentials that have been shown to go on for hours and so that's this signal that's propagating into the whole brain and body okay so the the important thing to understand is this is not a quick switch that's why I suggest on non cloudy days we'll call them that people get 10 minutes or so of sunlight in their eyes in the early part of the day another 10 minimum in the later part of the day as much sunlight in their eyes as they safely can throughout the day but since you're a physician I should just um and you had a guest on talking about this recently when the sun is low in the Sky low solar angle sunlight that's really the key time for we'll talk about in a moment and when the sun is low in the sky you run very very little risk of inducing cataract by looking in the general direction of the sun you should still blink as needed to protect the eyes it's when the sun is overhead and there's all those photons coming in quickly in one in a short period of time that you do have to be concerned about cataract and um macular degeneration if you're getting too much daytime sunlight so the idea is sunglasses in the middle of the day are fine but you really should avoid using them in the early and later part of the day unless you're driving into the Sun and you need you know for safety reasons another question Andrew if if a person is indoors but they have large windows so they're they're getting tons of sunlight into their space they don't even need ambient indoor light how much of the photons are making it through the glass and how does that compare to this effect yeah in general unless the light is coming directly through the window most of the relevant wavelengths are filtered out in other words if you can't see the sun through the window even if sufficient light is being provided that's insufficient to trigger this phenomenon that's right however if you have um you know windows on your roof which some people do skylights that makes the situation much much better in fact the neurons that in the eye that signal to the circadian clock and these mood centers in the brain reside mainly in the bottom twoth thirs of the neural retina and are responsible for looking up basically they're Gathering light from above these cells are also very low resolution so think of them as big pixels uh they're not interested in patterns and edges and movement they're interested in how much ambient light there happens to be now keep in mind that this mechanism is perhaps the most well-conserved mechanism in cellular organisms so there and I'll use that as a way to frame up "

            "text": "the four types of light that one needs to see every 24 hours for Optimal Health and and when I say Optimal Health I really mean mental health and physical health but we're going to talk about mental health mainly today in this paper there's an absolutely beautiful evolutionary story whereby single cell organisms all the way to humans dogs rabbits and everything in between have at least two cone opson one that responds to short wavelength light AKA blue light and another one that responds to longer wavelength light orange and red so your dogs have this we have this and it's a comparison mechanism in these cells of the eye these neurons of the eye they compare contrast between blues and orange or sometimes blues and reds and pinks which are also all long wavelength light there are two times of day when the sky is enriched with Blues oranges pinks and reds and that's low solar angle sunlight at Sunrise and in the evening these cells are uniquely available to trigger the ex existence of those wavelengths of light early in the day and in the evening not in the middle of the day so these cells have these two cone photo pigments and they say how much blue light is there how much red light is there or orange light and the subtraction between those two triggers the signal for them to fire the signal off to the circadian clock of the brain and that's why I say look at low solar angle sunlight early in the day what that does is it what call it as phase advances the clock this can get a little Technical and we don't want to get too technical here but think about pushing your kid on a swing the period of That Swing the duration of That Swing is a little bit longer than 12 hours okay so when you stand closer to the kid so your kid swings back and you give it a push you're shortening the period right you're not allowing the swing to come all the way up that's what happens when you look at morning sunlight you're advancing your circadian clock translate to English or non- nerd speake you're making it such that you will want to go to bed a little bit earlier and wake up a little bit earlier the next day in the evening when you view low solar angle sunlight so in the a the afternoon Setting Sun or evening Setting Sun you do the exact opposite you're phase delaying in the clock it's the equivalent of your kid being at the very top of the of the Ark and so it's gone you know maybe 12 and a half hour uh 12 let's say 12 and a half hours is the duration of that swing and you run up and you push them from behind and give them a little more push that's the equivalent of making yourself stay up a little later and wake up a little later these two signals average so that your clock stays stable You Don't Drift meaning you're not waking up earlier every single day or going to sleep later every single day this is why it's important to view low solar angle sunlight in the morning and again in the evening as often as possible and it's done by that readout of those two photo pigments now midday sun which contains its bright light but you see it as white light contains all of those wavelengths at equal intensity so the middle of the day is the so-called circadian Dead Zone in the middle of the day bright light triggers the activation of the of the other opson the melanopsin which increases mood increases feelings of well-being has some other consequences but you can't shift your circadian clock by viewing the sun in the middle of the day because it's in the Circadian Dead Zone it's the equivalent of pushing your kid on the swing when they're at the bottom of the Arc you can get a little bit more but not much and in biological terms you get nothing so this is why looking at sunlight in the middle of the day is great but it's not going to help anchor your sleep wake cycle and if you think about this is incredible right every organism from single cells to us has this mechanism to know when the sun is rising and when the Sun is setting and it's a color comparison mechanism which tells us that actually color vision Evolved first not for pattern Vision not for seeing beautiful sunsets and recognizing that's beautiful or paintings or things of that sort but rather for setting the circadian clock now what if you only do one of these Enders so what if you've got constant exposure to low Morning Light but your job prevents you from doing the same in the evening or vice versa yeah a great question better to get the Morning Light because if if you have to pick between low solar angle light earlier later in the day and keep in mind if you miss a day no big deal it's a slow integrative mechanism average ing across the previous two or 3 days but if you miss a day you'll want to get twice as much light in your eyes that next morning the reason it's better to do in the morning as opposed to the evening although both would be to do uh best would be to do both excuse me is that most people are getting some artificial light exposure in the evening anyway and here's the Diabolical thing your retina is very insensitive to light early in the day you need a lot of photons to trigger this mechanism early in the day as the day goes on retinal sensitivity increases and it takes very little light to shift your circadian clock late in the day keep in mind also that if you do see afternoon and evening sunlight there's a beautiful study published in science science reports yes science reports two years ago showing that that can partially offset the negative effects of artificial light exposure at night I think of this as your Netflix inoculation and the amount of melatonin suppression from Nighttime light exposure is haved by viewing even Setting Sun now keep in mind you don't need to see The Sun Cross The Horizon it can just be when it's low solar angle so you're looking for those yellow blue or blue pink blue red contrast and on cloudy days believe it or not they're still there just you don't perceive as much of it coming through so there really so that's three things that we should all strive to do view low solar angle sunlight early in the day view solar angle sunlight later in the day and get as much bright light in our eyes as we safely can ideally from sunlight throughout the day and if you can't do that get perhaps invest in one of these uh sad lights although they can be a bit expensive U there are a couple companies that are starting to design Sunrise simulators and evening simulators that are actually good that actually work um but right now my read is that aside from one company out there which by the way I have no relationship to it's called the 20 light tuo and that light bulb was developed by the biologist at the University of Washington who basically discover covered these color opponent mechanisms um those lights are not particularly expensive but they're um they do seem to work in fact they they're the study that is emerging again unpublished data seems to indicate that if you look at it for more than five or six minutes it can induce a mild Euphoria that's how powerful this contrast is and what they did there in that light I'll just tell you the mechanism is they figured out that when most people look at low solar angle sunlight in the morning they're getting 19 reversals of blue orange per second so when you look at this light it looks like a a barely flashing white light but it's reversals of orange and blue orange and um and you know red and blue and it's happening so what what does the person looking at it perceive um well I've used one of these um it just looks like a a flickering light and of course there's the always the potential of a placebo effect but well that's what I was going to say is there a way to control for that by having something that looks the same to the user but of course is not producing the same photo effect yeah well they've done that with the 10,000 Lux sad lamps and you and which most people use to try and IND do Sunrise simulation in their home but keep in in mind that Sunrise is gives you this comparison of short and long wavelength light just a bright 10,000 Lux light triggers one of the options that that but it won't set your circadian clock so most of the sad lamps that are out there are activating only one of the mechanisms in these cells that's relevant and not the one that's most relevant so I'm excited about what 20 is doing I think that um and again I have no relation to them except I know the biologists who did the work that that provide the mechanistic logic for the that engineering I still think um we're in the like the really like early days of this stuff what should be done is to have this stuff built into your laptop right it should be built into your phone and hopefully it will be now I mentioned this color contrast thing in "

            "text": "sunrise and sunset I mentioned the bright light throughout the day but there's a fourth light stimulus that turns out to be really important and this will provide the segue into the paper turns out that dark exposure at night independent of light exposure during the day is important for mental health outcomes now most people think dark exposure how do I think about that well it is dark absence of light it's the absence of light but what this paper really drives home is that people who make it a point to get dark exposure at night aka the absence of light at night actually benefit even if they're not getting enough sunlight during the day and this is especially true for people with certain mental health issues so I don't think we can overstate the value of PR of accurately timed light exposure to the eyes in the context of mental health I think you know there's so much data by now I will say however that some people seem more resilient to these light effects than others meaning some people you know also don't suffer from jet lag too much some people can stay up late get a lot of bright light exposure in the middle of the night and during the day they got their sunglasses on all day and they're in a great mood all the time other people are more susceptible these sorts of things and we don't know whether or not gen polymorphisms underly that I personally am very sensitive to sunlight in the sense that if I don't get enough sunlight I don't feel well after a couple of days um but I'm less sensitive to light exposure at night for instance but I think it is perhaps this is a big statement but is perhaps the most fundamental environmental stimulus for levels of arousal and alertness which correlate with all sorts of you know neuromodulator and hormone outputs and um so none of this should come as any surprise I will mention one last thing there was a study published gosh over 10 years ago now from Chuck iser Lab at Harvard Medical School is a phenomenal lab exploring circadian human health behavior he's just considered a no pun a luminary in the field but there wasn't a study that was in error where they had published in Science magazine that light shown behind the knee could shift circadian rhythms and that paper was retracted um and a lot of people don't know that it was retracted light exposure to the eyes is what's relevant here and as far as we know the color of one's eyes like Darkness or lightness of one's eyes Bears no relevance on their sensitivity to these types of mechanisms and on and on so so one question one comment the question again is going back to the morning evening light and I spend a lot of time looking at those types of skies for example just because of the nature of my hobbies great right because I'm always doing archery in the morning and rucking in the afternoon so it's not uncommon that I'm seeing both of those how relevant is it that the Sun be above the Horizon so for example um it begins to get light about in 30 minutes before sunrise and then you know right at so if sunrises at 7:30 first light is is 7 and then you know sort of 7:15 to 7 uh 30 is actually quite bright I mean you can see anything and everything and the same as true at Sunset so does does that 30 minutes pre or when sun is Beneath The Horizon constitute part of that 10 minutes it does I mean in an ideal circumstance you'd get outside and see the sunrise every day and you'd see the sunset every day even on cloudy days some people like myself wake up before the sun comes up in which and I get this question all the time well in the absence of powers to make the sunrise faster which I'm not aware anyone has certainly not me I think the best thing to do is simply to turn on as many Bright Lights as you can indoors to trigger that melanopsin mechanism if you want to be awake if you want to stay asleep or sleepy then keep them dim and then get outside once the sun is starting to come out some people wake up after the sun has risen right in which case get what you can and some people wake up 10 a.m. or noon in which case you can still get the bright light exposure but but you won't shift your circadian clock now in the evening especially in the winter months it's important to look West and try and get some sunlight in your eyes in the evening if you've ever gone into the clinic for instance at 2 o'clock in the afternoon after lunch you know and then in the winter and then come out and it's dark when you're walk into your car it's a kind of eerie feeling that sort of eerie feeling May correlate with the fact that you missed a signal your your brain is trying to orient your brain and body in time and that's what all of this is right it's trying to orient in time and again some people are more susceptible to that than others some people might like that um feeling of oh I went in when it was bright and I come out when it's dark but the vast majority of people feel better when they're getting this morning and evening sunlight exposure and this is especially important in kids all right this is one of the things that you know this paper points out and their good data that people are spending approximately 90% of their time indoors nowadays daytime time time indoors and those indoor environments are simply not bright enough you think oh there's all these bright lights and some people are putting blue blockers on in the middle of the day which is the worst thing you could possibly do if you're going to wear blue blockers and I don't think they're necessary but if you're going to wear them you'd want to wear them at night and in the evening you don't need to wear blue blockers you just simply should dim the lights and ideally have lights that are set a little bit lower in your environment which the Scandinavians have been doing for a long time so you know kill the overhead lights and don't obsess about bright light exposure in the middle of the night in fact for a long time I and some other people were saying oh you know even just a brief flash of light in the middle of the night can you quash your melatonin that's true but the other time in which you're in the quote unquote circadian dead zone is in the middle of the night you can't shift your circadian clock in the middle of the night but you know all of this gets down to inter weaving rhythms of light sensitivity temperature hormone output cortisol it I mean there's a whole landscape of circadian biology this paper um which was published in a new Journal I'm really excited about called nature mental health this journal was just "

            "text": "launched recently uh is entitled day and night light exposure are associated with psychiatric disorders and objective light study in more than 85,000 people now I have to say that I think the title of this paper is terrible sorry folks at nature mental health because if one just read the title it sounds like day and night light exposure associated with psychiatric disorders right if this were If This Were a newspaper headline You' be like oh my goodness well what are you supposed to do right but that's not the conclusion the conclusion is that getting a lot of sunlight exposure during the day and getting a lot of dark exposure at night is immensely beneficial for psychiatric health and in a number of ways now I'm not one to bring up another paper unannounced but I will say that this paper built off a previous study entitled time spent in outdoor light is associated with mood sleep and circadian rhythm related outcomes and that was a cross-sectional longitudinal study in 400,000 biobank participants so this UK biobank is an incredibly valuable resource and there are now multiple studies establishing that one's pattern of light exposure is extremely important now the previous study in 400,000 participants basically nailed home the idea that the more time you spend Outdoors the better your is your mood the better is your sleep the better is the rhythmicity of your sleep wake cycles and on and on something that I think even though people will say we've known that for thousands of years needed scientific substantiation this new study essentially looked at the relative contributions of daytime light exposure and nighttime dark exposure and they did that on a background of it looking in particular at people who had major depressive disorder generalized anxiety PT SD bipolar disorder he here's the the basic takeaway and I'll I'll quote them here and then I'll I'll tell you my interpretation that here I'm quoting avoiding night at light and seeking light during the day I love that word seeking may be a simple and effective non-pharmacologic means for broadly improving mental health so that's a pretty bold statement right and I love that they say seeking because it implies that people aren't reflexively getting the light exposure that they need that this needs to be a practice ice much like Zone 2 cardio or resistance training okay so so what did they do in this study so basically they gathered up 100,000 people or so it eventually was paired down to about 86,000 participants because some just didn't qualify or didn't report their data back they equipped them with accelerometers on their wrist and those wrist devices also could measure ambient light now that's not a perfect tool because what you'd love to do is measure ambient light at the level the Eyes by the way will somebody design an eyeglass frame that changes color when you've gotten sufficient light from sunlight during the day and then and then at night is a different color and then if you're getting too much light exposure will go to a different color frame this has to be possible so that you don't have to wonder if you got enough light during the day and of course if it's at the level of the eyes then you know that's what's landing at the eyes yeah and it's l i mean that's what I was going to ask you about that do these wrist based devices potentially get covered by clothing and some like turned you have your sleeves down I have my sleeves up they had it on the outside of the sleeve but they asked that people just keep it on their dominant hand it's not perfect but in some ways it's kind of nice that it's not perfect we could turn that disadvantage into an advantage by thinking you know when the person is out and about they're not often looking right at the sun you know if you're talking to a colleague under an overhang for instance so it's it's not perfect directionally it's directionally right okay and then they had two hypotheses two primary hypotheses one that greater light exposure in the day is associated with lower risk for psychiatric disorders and two second hypotheses greater light exposure at night is associated with higher risk for psychiatric disorders and poorer mood this is oh so relevant for the way we live now people on screens and tablets in the middle of the night okay then they collected information about how much light exposure people were getting as well as their sleep and their activity and so on I should mention this was done in males and females it was a slightly older cohort than one is used to seeing people in their 50s and 60s they had psychiatric diagnosis information and then they divided people into essentially two groups but they had a lower so a q1 and a Q2 a lower cortile that meant people that were getting less daytime light as opposed to the third and fourth quartile more daytime light they also had a nighttime light exposure evaluation and they had people were in the low q1 and Q2 so these people are getting less nighttime life light versus Q3 Q4 more nighttime light nicely they also looked at sleep duration and they looked at photo period meaning how long the days were for those individuals how active they were what 10 hours a day 14 hours a day because the more active you are the more opportunity for light exposure you have during the day or night for instance okay so it they had I would say fairly complete data sets then and I'm just going to kind hit the top Contour of what they did in each and sorry sleep duration sleep efficiency Etc was determined off the accelerometer that's right as well as self-report yeah not not ideal right you'd love for people to be wearing a woop bander or or a ring or something of that sort but this was initiated some time ago so um they either didn't have access to that technology or for whatever reason didn't select it I'd like to take a brief moment and "

            "text": "they have information on who has major depressive disorder who has PTSD generalized bipolar psychosis Etc and then they ran three models and you can tell me what you think about the power of these models but you know as somebody who thinks about the mechanistic aspect of all of this a lot but not somebody who's ever run this type of study I'd be really curious model one examined the unadjusted association between day and nighttime light exposure and psychiatric outcome so just basically asking is there a relationship between how much light you get it during during the day and how much light you get at night and how bad your or your depression is or anxiety is ETC looking at you know just a standard ratio of the probability that you have a certain symptom or set of symptoms versus you don't given a certain amount of light exposure model two adjusted for the age of the person their sex and ethnicity and photo period so they looked at you know how long the days were in that given person's region of the world and then model three these people were all in the UK or were they around the world they were all in the UK as far as I know and then model three adjusted for employment so employed versus unemployed which if you think about it is pretty important like you say well an unemployed person has a lot more time to control these variables but an employed person who's doing shift work does not right and they they Incorporated information about employed versus unemployed physical activity which turns out to be very important and then things like shift work etc and so these what what we can say very safely is that the outcomes with each of these models the results were very similar so we don't want to discard the differences between those models entirely but in my read is in every figure of the paper it doesn't seem like model one two or three differ from one another in terms of total outcome yeah that's an unusual aspect of this paper so so these adjustments are very standard right so that's this is a a classic uh tool that's used in most epidemiology um because you don't have randomization so once randomization is out the window you know you you're like so for example the paper I'm going to present is based on an RCT there will be no models it's just he the data right yeah here they're asking people what what do you do report back to us we're going to measure your light exposure but no one was assigned to any groups they swapped there the the whatever quote unquote controls are there they're really not there it's just comparisons between groups so what is interesting to me uh is that as it's exactly as you said and we'll make all these figures available in addition to the papers but um I mean there it's very unusual that there's no difference between the unadjusted and the adjusted models and as you say there's probably two places out of you know 30 when you look at all the different quartile comparisons where you might Creep from you know statistically significant just out of it or just into it but yeah you could simplify this figure two completely by just showing one of the models and you would be you know getting 95% of the information which is you know I mean I think in one way that suggests that there's less dependency on those variables of course it still doesn't address probably the greatest question question I have here which I'm sure we'll get to at some point as as you continue yeah so I'm very curious what that question is but I'll I'll I'll suppress my curiosity for the moment you know so if we look at figure two of this paper and I realize a lot of people are listening and and they're not able to look at this although we have posted the figures on the YouTube versions of this uh just want to make clear what's going on just for those that are listening essentially what they're looking at is what they call the odds ratio which is the probability of something happening in one group vers divided by the probability of something happening in another group I guess would it by way of example be you know if you're going to look at the odds ratio of you know the probability of somebody getting lung cancer if they smoke versus probability somebody getting lung cancer if they don't smoke so odds ratios and Hazard ratios are often confused they're very similar and odds ratios generally refer to a lifetime exposure whereas a hazard ratio is um defined over a specific period of time but the MTH is still effectively the same and uh using the example you gave if you took the odds ratio of um you know death so let's talk all cause mortality for a smoker versus a nonsmoker and the answer were 1.78 I'm making that up but that's directionally correct 1.78 as an odds ratio means there's a 78% chance greater of the outcome of interest in this case death by any cause in the affected Group which would be the smokers so odds ratio of two is 100% and odds ratio of three is 200% so the math is take the number subtract one and that's the percent you know figure two of this paper is one of the key take-homes they essentially look at the odds ratio of people who are in the let's say that let's just look at the nighttime light exposure and just remind me Andrew CU and and everybody else watching the every one of these is showing second third fourth as your x-axis meaning they're all being compared to the first quartile that's right and the first quartile is lowest light exposure or highest light exposure low well or well we have to um differentiate between day and night that's right okay so restate it sure so uh if we look at you know what is your risk of a psychiatric challenge broadly speaking well panel a is is major depressive disorder if you are in the second quartile third quartile or fourth quartile of nighttime light exposure so second being the least amount of nighttime light exposure third being more nighttime light exposure and fourth the most nighttime light exposure relative to the first quartile this is just a stupid thing like if I were doing this figure if you were doing this in a lecture you know what you would do to make it so easy you would draw arrows on it that say increasing light exposure at night decreasing light exposure in the day it's the same information it just makes it easier for the reader to understand absolutely but and maybe the teaching point I think is is for people when they review articles like don't be afraid to do that and just kind of like oh I've got all over this exactly so it's like I I draw the arrow that's increasing light that's decreasing light and that's how I can pay attention to what's actually happening right and I'm actually in touch with the editorial staff at nature at nature mental health although they don't know that I'm covering this paper until after this comes out you know I think one thing that scientific journals really really need to do is start making the readability of the Articles better for nonex experts I mean chances are if you can't understand a graph and this is true for everybody chances are there's a problem with the way it's presented yeah put it on them but then of course try and parse it because um you know rarely if ever is it all spelled out clearly but anyway that's what we're trying to do here so yeah the way I would have done is say second quartiles low amounts "

            "text": "of nighttime light exposure and Define what that is you know third quartile is more light exposure and then fourth maximum amount of light exposure at night and basically what you see is that the probability of having worse major depressive symptoms linearly increases as you go from the second to third to Fourth quartile so more nighttime light exposure worse for you and there's a dose response if you will of the effect now we can March through or describe figure two pretty quickly by saying the same thing is true now just talking about nighttime light exposure for generalized anxiety disorder so that's panel C bipolar disorder although the difference between the second and the third quartile in bipolar disorder isn't as traumatic once you get up to the fourth quartile bipolar symptoms get much worse when people are getting nighttime light exposure I really want to emphasize that point because they go on in the discussion of this paper to reemphasize that point several times in fact they say that while light EXP exposure during the day of course we will go into the data is beneficial for mental health for people with bipolar disorder it seems that light exposure at night is especially problematic independent of how much sunlight they're getting during the day so your bipolar um in the person with bipolar disorder who's struggling with either a manic or a depressive episode who's making a point to get sunlight during the day who's also getting light exposure at night is making their symptoms worse and keep in mind they they couldn't completely control this but is largely independent of things like sleep duration so that doesn't necessarily mean that the person's sleeping less although in a in a manic episode presumably they are it's independent of exercise it's independent of a bunch of other things because any any logical person will hear this and say okay well they're they G more light at night because they're doing a bunch of other things but it's largely independent of those other things likewise the symptomology of PTSD gets far worse with increasing light exposure at night self harm really takes a a leap from being fairly I don't want to say minimal at the second and third quartile so low and let's say medium I'm using some I'm taking some Liberties here but low in medium amounts of of artificial light exposure at night than for people who get quite a lot of nighttime light exposure self harm goes up and probability of Psych psychotic episodes goes up or psychotic symptoms now what's nice is that the what's nice about the data is that the exact inverse is basically true for daytime light exposure although not across the board we can generally say that for major depressive disorder generalized anxiety bipolar symptoms there it's a little more scattered PTSD and self harm the more daytime light exposure ideally from sunlight because that's actually what's being measured in most cases we could talk about how we know that is going to approximately linearly drop the probability or the severity of these symptoms and we could just explain again that the odds ratios now seem to be going down so an odds ratio of 7 now refers to a 30% reduction in the variable of interest here exactly now the The psychosis panel F which uh focuses on psychosis I think is also worth mentioning in in a bit more detail there's a fairly dramatic reduction in psychotic symptoms as one gets more daytime light exposure independent of nighttime light exposure there's a well-known phenomenon called ICU psychosis which is that people come into the hospital for a broken leg or a car accident maybe they were getting surgery from from Peter back when for something totally independent they're they're housed in the hospital and as anyone who's ever been in a hospital as a patient or visitor knows the light in the lighting environment of the hospital is absolutely dreadful for health just Dreadful I mean people often complain about the food in the cafeteria as being unhealthy that's often not always true not always true but the lighting environments in hospitals is absolutely counter especially especially in the Intensive Care Unit yeah right I think the the Intensive Care Unit at Hopkins the main one the the main sucku didn't have Windows people who who go into the hospital with with a brain injury or or with a stroke or something I get contacted all the time even though I'm not a clinician what should I do for my kid my parent my I say get them near a window and start to the best of your abilities controlling their sleep wake cycle now often times there's there you know nurses coming in and taking blood tests and measuring pulses in the middle of the night that's disruptive there there's bright light not just blue light that's disruptive it's noisy that's disruptive ICU psychosis is when non psychotic individuals start having psychotic episodes in the hospital because of nighttime light exposure and in some cases lack of daytime sunlight we can can say that with some degree of confidence because when those people go home even though sometimes their symptoms for what brought them to the hospital in the first place get worse their psychosis goes away now and it's independent of medication so let's just be really direct there is a possibility that we are all socially jetlagged that we are all disrupting these mood regulation symptoms systems excuse me by not getting enough daytime light and by getting too much nighttime light if we want to look at just some of the bullet points of the takeaways and then Peter thank you you highlighted a few of these but can we just go back to this figure two for a second there's a handful of "

but the there are a few that really stand out um and again I love this figure um I would have labeled it a little differently to make it completely userfriendly but nevertheless the increasing light at night and the impact on depression let let me be really technical in what I say and the relationship or correlation to depression is very strong um the relationship to light and self harm in the upper cortile so when you take those 25% of people with the most nighttime light that relationship to self harm is interesting and completely uncoupled from the other 75% that's interesting but uncoupled you mean that at the lower levels of light exposure at night you're not seeing an increase in self harm not what and then once you get to that fourth quartile it's a big step it's like a 30% greater risk of self yeah so it's totally flat the first second third quartile no different and then fourth big jump um and then the the the inverse relationship right as light increases during the daytime you see this reduction in self harm interesting the PTSD relationship based on nighttime light and The psychosis relationship based on daytime light those are the ones that really jumped out to me uh I think anxiety relatively the you know less impressive here and and bipolar disorder didn't seem as strong right as well so I think those those are the big ones that that jumped out to me yeah I agree there's AIT there's a bit more scatter on generalized anxiety and and the degree of the sign the degree of significant change is not is not as robust in other words getting a lot of daytime light ideally from sunlight is not necessarily going to reduce your levels of anxiety getting a lot of nighttime light exposure is not increasing nighttime anxiety that much although 20% you know is is not nothing um for nighttime light exposure but yeah where the psychosis major major depression and self harm are really you know they leap out actually we maybe we even just drill a little bit deeper on major depression basically when you go from the second to third quartile of nighttime light exposure so more than nighttime light exposure you basically go from no significant increase to almost almost a 20% increase and then as you get up to the fourth quartile so the most nighttime light exposure you're at about 25% increase in major depressive symptoms not that's no joke um and you know and I think that I think that we you know if we were to uh know we don't have the data right here but if we were to look at like standard SSRI treatment for major depression you know um people debate this pretty actively but um light is is a very potent stimulus and the timing of light is critical because on the the inverse is also true as you get to the fourth quartile of daytime light exposure you get about a 20% reduction in major depressive disorder what I like about a study like this is that it puts the error bars so easy to see on the data and why is that interesting well um there's there's um there's a there's a belief that bigger is always better in sample size and we often talk about that through the lens of power analysis right so how many subjects do we need to um to to reach a conclusion that is powered to you know this level and that's that's true but what I don't think gets discussed as often is the opposite of that which is what if you overpower a study in other words what if the power analysis says to be uh to have a level of power at 90% you need a th000 subjects and you Sayre we're going to do 10,000 subjects well you're clearly powered for it but you might be overpowered and people might say well why would that be a bad thing it could be a bad thing because it means you are very likely to reach statistical significance in things that might not be actually significant and so one thing about this study that is just a quick back like kind of a quick and dirty way to tell that it's probably not overpowered is that you have varying lengths of error bars and what that tells me is that and again this is not like a formal statistical analysis it's just kind of like a back of the envelope statistical analysis if you look for example at self harm in the top quartile you actually have pretty big error bars in fact all the self harm have sort of slightly bigger error bars and yet when you look at for example the depression even though the a bars aren't all the same size they're tighter in fact when you look at the relationship between depression and daytime light the air bars are really really small so that just gives me confidence that there is variability in this which paradoxically you kind of want to see because it tells me that this wasn't just done you know there was I think you said 8,000 subjects were in this and I realized 8 more than 86,000 86,000 sorry yeah you realize that it wasn't that oh this should have been done with a tenth of that or a half of that and we're picking up um signal that is statistically relevant but clinically irrelevant yeah thanks for for that point that I didn't pay attention to that um I mean I paid attention to the air bars but I didn't know that um so thank you I'm learning too and I I suppose for people that are listening we can just give them a sense of what the error bar ranges are for self harm you know they're running you know as much as 20% either side of the the mean the average and for major depression it looks like it's more like let's say 8 to 10% if if that if that maybe like five right so um yeah I see what you're saying so when you get a a a very large sample size you're going to have some outliers in there and you can mask those outliers just by having so many data points right yeah because these error bars directly tell you whether or not your statistically significant so what's really nice about this type of graph and you see these in there's going to be a graph in my paper where you see the same analysis um they're always drawing the 95% confidence interval on the on the data point and if the 95% confidence interval does not touch the the line of unity which in this case is the the the the hods ratio of 1.0 or the x-axis then you know it's statistically significant to the confidence interval they've defined which is almost assuredly 95% sometimes they'll make it tighter at 99 and so that's why you can just look right at these and go oh look you know in depression the second quartile didn't reach statistical significance because the error bars are touching the line just as the case for the second and third quartile for self harm but when you look at the fourth quartile you can see that the lower tip of the error bars isn't anywhere near Unity and so we know without having to look up the P value that it's uh smaller than either 05 or 0.1 however they've defined it and it's really amazing when you see these you know overpowered studies which are easier to do epidemiologically where you know the P value ends up being microscopic you know they can they can drive their P values down to anything low because sample size can be infinite but you know you can see that it's just like the the error bar is just skimming above the uh the the unity line but it's so so so tight I'd like to take a quick break to acknowledge our sponsor element "

you might need very little light at night in order to negatively impact your mood systems and in fact they make this argument in the discussion as an interesting point that I think is worth mentioning what because here what I again what I like about the study is that they've separated day and nighttime light exposure turns out that many of the drugs that are used to treat bipolar disorder reduce the Sens are are effective perhaps in part because they reduce the sensitivity of the light sensing circadian apparati now that's interesting right if if you think about this okay so these are drugs that can ameliorate some of the symptoms of bipolar perhaps in part by reducing the extent to which nighttime light exposure can relieve bipolar symptoms can excuse me can exacerbate bipolar symptoms conversely there's evidence that people who take take certain anti-depressants May suppress the ability for daytime light to positively impact the mood systems of the brain now of course we don't want people halting their medication on the basis of that statement alone please don't you know talk to your psychiatrist but if we know one thing for sure it's that if you want a significant outcome and a paper as a scientist give a drug any drug and look at the amount of rapid eye movement sleep or the Circadian cycle pretty much any drug Alters the Circadian rhythm for better or worse but if we start to think about which medications might adjust our overall sensitivity to light sometimes this could be a good thing you think less sensitivity to light well for people who have bipolar disorder the amount of daytime light exposure isn't that important for their overall mood regulation but the amount of nighttime light exposure really is in other words Darkness for eight hours every night should be viewed in my opinion as a treatment for bipolar disorder not the only treatment but it's also clear that we should all be avoiding really bright extensive really bright nighttime light exposure I mean if if anything you know my take away from this study is that Darkness at night is the fourth key light stimulus now a couple of things very bright Moonlight very bright candle light is probably only like gosh three to 50 lucks what when you go outside on a brightly lit full moon night I encourage people to download this free app I have no relationship to it called light meter and it gives you a pretty good read of what the lucks are in that environment by the way a lot of people don't realize this they think you just tap the button and then it tells you how many lucks you hold it down it's kind of fun you can scan around the room and see how many lucks are on average coming from that location or outside go out on a really bright moonl night I mean we we should have a full moon tonight yeah let's do it you're not going to get above a 100 Lux that's incredible you're sitting at a candlelight dinner with your spouse or with friends and it's clearly bright enough to see them put that lux meter right up not too close to the flame 50 to 200 Lux i i 4 interesting experience a couple of months ago on an elk hunt where it was a full moon which actually makes the hunting not so great but it was the first time I've ever noticed my shadow in relation to the Moon uh that's how bright it seemed the light was this is Halloween appropriate since we're coming out we we're recording this close to Halloween it's remarkable super interesting to think it could be that dim campfire you know and Fire Light you think okay gathering around a campfire then okay you know everyone circadian rhythm must have been disrupted for ages before the development of of electric electricity no no that th those campfires are extremely bright but they're they're they're not they're not that bright compared to a very densely overcast day and what is is your phone if you don't use any sort of uh light mitigating uh Tech on it well distance matters um at the distance we're holding it yeah with so with all the the wavelengths cranked up so no uh there is a nice feature intrinsic to the phone where you can eliminate the blues at night or you know this kind of thing but if you crank it up to maximum light intensity probably something like you know 500 to 1,000 Lux now keep in mind though it's additive right so it's over time so Lux is a measure of I think I think it relates back to Candelas it's the amount of light um shown at I think it's like the the one meter away and there's a squaring and a falling off of distance we can look it up um these are old measurement old school measurements converted to Lux but keep in mind that if you're looking at your phone or tablet at 800 Lux or 500 Lux in the evening you do that for 2 hours well you're summing quite a lot of photons now it is true and I I I I do want to be fair to the biology uh and it'd be dishonest to say anything different you know we we've hammered on people about not shifting their circadian rhythm with light at night but we know that the middle of the day and the middle of the night are circadian dead zones you can't shift your circadian rhythm that well in the middle of the day and the middle of the night but you can provide a wakeup signal for for your body and brain it's really that sunrise and sunset that are critical that's why I said there are four things see sunrise or sunrising you don't need to see across the Horizon Sunset bright light during the day minimize light exposure at night and you don't need Pitch Black in fact pitch black probably just increases the frequency of injury you know I get up in the middle of the night to use the bathroom probably once I think it's normal I go back to sleep you know if it were pitch black I'd probably injure myself so just just dim it down some people use red lights you know our friend Rick Ruben yeah Rick ruin is uh can we tell a funny story about Rick yeah of course of course you know this story but just I just in casee Rick's listening he'll appreciate this you know when Rick was uh here staying last summer um he's up in our guest house and he came down after the first night and he was like unacceptable you know what I'm talking about unacceptable accommodations what did he do he removed all the lighting that existed in that room and replaced it with red light bulbs which I later used when I stayed here and then later stole when I left the teenage me I took them I took him that's why Derek when he stayed here lane or anyone else when he stayed here Cony or anyone else didn't have those I took them I love them so funny Jill is like you know Rick changed every light in the guest house to Red I'm like yeah no I didn't know that but I'm not surprised yeah well in his place he has mostly either no lighting or red lighting so during the day he just goes by ambient light um and then red light in the evening and or candle light and it's great and you know people hear red lights and they think they have to buy these expensive red light units that's not what we're talking about that you can literally buy red party lights or just a red bulb some people say well can I just use a red film or can I put a t-shirt over the lamp I worry about people putting t-shirts over lamp because of the fire hazard um but I'll be honest I dim the lights in my home at night um when I travel sometimes I will bring one of the the stolen from Rick Rubin red lights the red the Rick rubben stash here's something where I've I've sort of softened my tune so I used to be "

whatever it was um I suspect that that matters somewhat but I think what matters more is the stimulation that may come from those things and what I've come to realize at least in me which means it probably is true in others as well and at least some others is that what I'm doing on my phone matters more than how how bright my phone is in other words if I've got the best blue light filter in the world on my phone but I'm doom scrolling social media and getting lit up on email that's way worse for me than if I've got my phone on maximum light and I'm like watching YouTube videos of F1 cars and driving around having fun like it's a totally different experience so so so the context matters and um I think I think for that reason I I I would want people to be mindful of the whole picture um you know going to bed under a period of you know intense duress brought on by something you know that's an equally dangerous component to all of this that's that's distinct from what we're talking about but but you know you just want i' like I want people to be able to think of this in the context of everything yeah I it's a really important point you know one thing I'll say is that if you're going to stay up past your normal bedtime if you're going to get a lot of light in your eyes I would hope that it would be for fun reasons and for reasons you enjoy you should definitely spend some nights out you should definitely do some all nighters studying if you really you know if you if it's going to help you get the grade that's permanent right I'd certainly have done all nighter studying and grant writing for years um you know there are going to be the inevitable allnighters due to God forbid a Hos trip to the hospital or you heard something on the news that really amped you up or you just simply can't sleep that stuff is going to happen so I think the goal should be to minimize light exposure at night and I think what you just said is especially true because we don't know for instance people talk about the negative impact of social media is it the fact that people are looking at this little box for so many hours per day is it all the things they're not doing is it what they're looking at per se all of those things interact and are really important I we know based on studies from the Stanford sleep lab that if you wake up in the middle of the night looking at what time it is can be very disruptive to your ability to fall back asleep and to your sense the next day it's just a placebo effect but it's a powerful one of how tired you are the next day they've done this where they wake people up in the middle of the night and then they say it's you know 4:00 a.m. versus 2: a.m. versus 6:00 a.m. and people's perceived levels of energy during the day in some ways correlate with what they think how much sleep they think they got likewise and this is one of the concerns potential concerns with sleep trackers yep Ali Crum talked about this when she came on our podcast you know if people see a poor sleep score they often feel worse than if they see a good sleep score now of course physiology matters you can't lie to yourself and say you you know got a great night of sleep simply by virtue of a sleep score but I worry more about the the false well I if it's a false negative that we don't want to put veilance on this seeing a bad sleep score and then deciding that you're going to have a terrible day you know I think a bad sleep score is an indication that you might need to dial some things in a bit better getting a great sleep score is an indication that you might be doing a number of things right and start looking at these things as averaging wouldn't would you agree yeah completely I I I I don't think it's that different from CGM right like I think that CGM is an amazing tool to provide insight and you pretty much know the insights after a relatively short period of time 30 days maybe at the outside 90 for for a really per for a person with a very complicated life um and you know all you need to know about how the inputs affect the output thereafter if you choose to use it it's a behavioral tool in other words you're using this to build in a Hawthorn effect I think the same is largely true with sleep trackers um most people have this profound sense of learning when they first encounter one of these things and and it's again you've heard it all 100 times oh my God I can't believe what alcohol does to my sleep right or caloric trackers exactly like I think a lane Norton's app carbon I have no Financial relationship to it I use it or and it's taught me wow like I consume a lot of calories in the form of certain things at certain times of day and there's just a lot of good learning in that but it's the Act of tracking that helps you manage it and similarly I think it's the act of knowing you're going to be looking at that score that gamifies it that kind of helps people do the right things oh you know what I'm not going to have that drink tonight or I'm not going to eat that snack before bed because I've now been conditioned to see how that impact score that said I think that um you know recovery scores and things like that are just notoriously poor at predicting performance and I think there's a reason that serious athletes would never use things like that um they would tend to rely on the more tried and true methods of predicting Behavior such as heart rate uh maybe heart rate variability but morning resting heart rate probably more predictive than anything else and then you know inw workout things such as heart rate heart rate recovery lactate threshold things like that so yeah I agree I think we have to and I say this as a guy who's generally perceived to be the most Pro device guy in the world people would be surprised how sparingly I use things like that I mean I do some Tracking not as much as "

            "text": "answerable because without randomization we can't know it but it's the question of how much reverse causality can exist in these observations so again these observations um demonstrate very tight correlations very strong associations especially in the five areas that we highlighted um but it's possible that part of what we're seeing um is reverse causality brought on by both the treatments which you've already kind of alluded to and also the condition itself do you want to explain reverse causality for people and maybe could you mention um for those that missed uh the Hawthorne effect just yeah yeah the the Hawthorne effect uh is is is an effect that is named after you know an observation of what took place in a factory where they were actually studying worker productivity with light of all things um but what refers to is the idea that people will change their behavior when they are observed so if um if I said well I really want to know what a day in the life is like for Andrew huberman I'm going to follow him around for a day it's very unlikely that his behavior that day will be exactly as it was if I wasn't there re why you probably will never see a day in the life of Andrew huberman although it's pretty it's pretty scripted unless I'm traveling it's a it's a you know it's morning sunlight hydration and you know some cardio or weight training and then a lot of time reading papers it'd be the most boring video in the world because mostly me reading and underlining things but it's why um gamifying things can be beneficial right it's why a CGM can can be beneficial because it's sort of like somebody's watching you and you're going to modify what you eat in response to it or why tracking can really be an effective way to reduce input because you there's a sense of being monitored by doing that especially if someone literally monitors it in other words you can set up an accountability partner where your health coach or someone is actually seeing the data so that's what it is now as far as reverse causality when you look at variables so um let's just pick u a common one that's unrelated to this so there there's an association that more diet soda consumption is associated with greater obesity it's a bit paradoxical right um is that true it is yeah it's it's been demonstrated in many series that the the the greater the consumption of diet soda the greater the prevalence of obesity and that has been postulated by some to suggest that non-nutritive sweeteners such as aspartame or sucrose or things like that are actually part of what's causing obesity um and while while there are probably some arguments you could make around the impact that those things might have on the gut microbiome and maybe there's some way and that's happening it's also equally likely if not probably more likely that there's reverse causality there that a person who is obese is therefore contemplating how much they're eating or thinking hey what's an easy way that I can reduce calories how about instead of drinking a Coke I drink a Diet Coke and so there the causality which you would impute to mean the drink is causing the Obesity it might be no the Obesity is causing the choice of drink so here the question is um how much of the effect we're seeing is a result of the condition that's being studied right how much of the disruption in both day and night ex uh light exposure is the result of the depression it's disregulated the sleep maybe they sleeping more during the day and more awake at night because of depression again these are you can't know this this is where epidemiology never allows us to determine this and sadly these questions can only be answered through either direct randomization or mandelian randomization which by the way I was going to also ask you do you know if anyone has examined this from a mandelian standpoint that would be that would be very interesting because I have to believe well it would be interesting I don't know enough about the biology to know what Snips would be studi but that would be interesting what Peter is saying is you know if you knew something about the genomes of these people um you would be in a great position to perhaps even link up light susceptibility genes or light light sensitivity genes with genes for you know Pathways involved in major depression bipolar I mean get getting to this issue of reverse causality I mean I think it's very straightforward to imagine that the person who's experiencing a manic episode is going to be up for two weeks at a time um sadly and getting a lot of nighttime light exposure you know now dark nighttime dark exposure as a treatment for bipolar is something that people are starting to talk about so making sure that even those people are awake that they're at least blue blocking at night um reducing their online activities but people with severe manic episodes have a hard time regulating their own behavior of course and it's not one or the other like I don't want the question to come across to the listener that it has to be one or the other it's only a can cause b or B can cause a no it's actually a lot of times these things feed off each other going back to the soda example I "

            "text": "you think about that point Andrew like how I mean you know you you know more about this stuff than I do but if if you had to just lay on your judgment right so so if it were if it were 100 to zero you would say the light is 100% causal in the effects we're seeing if it were zero to 100 you'd say nope the behavior is 100% causal of the exposure to light where do you again you can't know it but what does your intuition tell you okay there's my intuition and then there's my recognition of my own bias um because you know I started working on these circadian Pathways origin in the eye back in year in 98 as a graduate student at Berkeley the the cells these melanops and intrinsically sensive retinal gangling cells were discovered in the early 2000s by a guy named Iggy provencio Dave Bon Sam hatar sain panta and others but and it was like one of the most important discoveries in all of biology clearly um so I've been very excited about systems but if I set that aside so um bias disclosure made I think 65 to 75% of the effects are likely due to light directly now it's impossible to tease those apart as you mentioned but to play Devil's Advocate against myself you know you could imagine that the depressed individual is laying around indoors with the curtains drawn they didn't sleep well the night before which gives you a photo sensitivity that isn't Pleasant like it sucks to have bright light in your eyes first thing in the morning if you especially if especially if you didn't sleep well and then they're you know making their coffee in a dimly lit what they think is brightly lit environment and then they're you know looking at their phone and the the state of the world sucks and their state of their internal landscape is rough and they're maybe they're dealing with a pain or or you know injury or something and their likelihood of getting outside is is low and when they do get outside they're going to shuffle and not you know so I could see how the behaviors could really limit the amount of of light exposure and then evening rolls around they've been tired all day and a common symptom of depression you fall asleep and then 2 or three in the morning they're wide awake what are you going to do at two or three when you're Wide Awake sit in the dark no you're going to get online you're going to listen to things you might have I'm not recommending this but a alcoholic drink in order to try and fall asleep I mean this is the pattern and so you know shaking up that pattern is really what what what so much of my public health work these days is about and trying to get people onto a more natural daylight night uh night dark Rhythm uh but yeah it's impossible to tease apart we do know this and this is uh really serious we know that in almost every instance EV almost every Psychopathology report of suicide in the weeks but especially in the days preceding suicide that person's circadian rhythms looked almost inverted from the normal patterns and that's true of nonbipolar individuals as well you know circadian disruption and disruption in psychiatric Health are inextricable conversely positive mood and affect and and circadian Behavior seem very correlated I mean I think um it's clear that if you want to become an early riser get light in your eyes and get activity in your body early in the day you you built that you entrained to those rhythms so that you start to anticipate that morning workout you start to anticipate the morning sunlight just one um more scientific point we know that when you view bright bright sunlight in the morning or just sunlight that's illuminating your environment as you said you don't even have to see the sun itself that there's a 55 z% increase in the amplitude of the morning cortisol Spike which is a good thing right that's when you want it because it's inversely the amplitude of the morning cortisol spike is inversely related to the amplitude of the evening cortisol Spike and high evening cour is law is associated with middle of the night waking and on and on so um you know I'm very bullish on these mechanisms I also love that they're so deeply woven into our evolutionary history you know that we share with single cell organisms it's so wild um but of course there's going to be a bidirectionality there and it's it's impossible to see where one thing starts and the other one stops I mean here's my take Andrew first of all I I actually with far less Authority than you um agree with your assessment and might even be a little bit more bullish might even put it at 8020 and and here I'll I'll give you my explanations which uh stem more from my fastidious battles with epidemiology in general right like because so much of the world that I live in still has to rely on epidemiologic data and so how do you make sense of it and the truth of it is most of it is really pretty bad um but I I tend to find myself looking at the Austin Bradford Hill criteria all the time and for folks who don't know um he was a statistician who basically proposed a set of criteria U believe there are eight of them and I can't believe I don't know every one of them off by heart I certainly used to um but the more of these criteria that are met within your correlations the more likelihood uh you will find causality so when I think of your data here the data in this paper I'll tell you what makes these correlations seem to have causality within them in the direction that's being proposed um look at the dose effect so dose effect matters and this is done in quartiles and that's a very elegant thing if they just did it as on off it would be harder high low that's right but the fact that they done in quartiles allows you to see that every example in figure two I don't believe there is an exception to this no and I think also in the in the other there's only one exception to what I'm about to say sorry two out of like God knows how many they're all monotonically increasing and decreasing in other words the dose effect is always present another thing is biologic plausibility you've spoken at length about that today so in other words sometimes you have to look at epidemiology and ask is there a biologic explanation and here there is you've added another one which is evolutionary conservation to the biologic plausibility then you can talk about animal models or experiments in humans over short durations that generally support these findings and and so those are just a couple of the the Bradford Hill criteria that that lead to um you know my belief that yeah there's reverse causality here but um it's not the full explanation and that more of the explanation is probably the direction that's being proposed um and if that's true because then at the end of the day like what's the purpose of the discussion the purpose of the discussion is if you are under the influence of any of these psychiatric conditions in addition to the treatments you're doing now what else can you do and to me the takeaway is follow these light behaviors I mean it's it's it's a that's a relatively low lift when you consider some of the other things like I'm over here asking people to do Zone 2 for three hours a week and VO2 max workouts and all this other stuff and like I think all those things matter for mental health as much as physical health but this strikes me as on the spectrum of low asks if it shows if it's only even 30% causality 70% reverse causality like I'll take those I I would still instate that yeah and it's you know it's taking your coffee on the balcony it's and people will often say well how do you do this with kids the kids should be doing it too right you know it means popping your sunglasses off it means getting out for just a few minutes and the fact that it's additive that these you know these Photon uh mechanis Photon counting mechanisms they some is great and look this paper also says and I should have stated this earlier if you missed your daytime light ration get your nighttime dark ration they are independent and additive so that's I mean that's a really something um but of course ideally you get both but I appreciate your take on it and um you know and thanks for for your uh expertise in parsing epidemiology I look at fewer studies of that of that sort but I learned from you and um that's one of the reasons I love doing these Journal clubs as I learn so along those lines uh tell us about the paper you selected I'm "

            "text": "how te- cells recognize and get activated how te- cells recognize antigens so we have something called uh an antigen so an antigen is an antibody generating peptide so it's a it's a it's a protein almost always a protein they can be carbohydrates but they're almost always proteins and they're very very small peptides like we're talking as little as nine amino acids maybe up to 20 amino acids so teeny tiny little peptid but it's amazing that in such a short peptide the body can recognize if that's Andrew or not Andrew I mean me again think think about like we talk about proteins in Kil adans right we're talking about proteins in terms of thousands of amino acids that make up every protein in your body and yet if it samples a protein and sees that hey this little 9 10 15 peptide amino acid is not part of you I know it's and therefore I'm going to generate an immune response to it so we have what are called antigen presenting cells you have cells that go around sampling peptides and they will on these things called MHC class receptors bring the peptide up to the surface and serve it up to the t- cell there are two types of these there's MHC class one and MHC Class 2 I only this is Major histo compatibility comple that's correct and um we refer to them that way because they DET because of the context in which they were discovered which was for organ rejection so not surprisingly when you need to put a kidney into another person if that kidney is deemed foreign it will not last long in the early days of organ transplantation were Rife with immediate rejections and by not not I mean the immediates are the incompatibilities but you know the the sort of next layer of incompatibility was MHC incompatibility which would lead to you know within within weeks the organ is gone as opposed to within hours so you have these two classes of MHC you have class one and class two class one is what we call endogenous so this is basically what happens when a protein or an antigen is coming from inside the cell so let's consider the flu so if you get the flu the influen a virus infects the respiratory epithelium of your uh you know your larynx and that virus as you know folks listening might remember from our days of talking about covid viruses can't replicate on their own what they do is they hijack the replication um Machinery of the host and they use that either to insert their RNA or DNA to replicate and in the process proteins are being made well those proteins are the proteins of the virus not of us so some of those peptides get launched onto these MH class MHC class one uh glove basically the glove comes up to the surface and a te- cell comes along and in the case of MHC class one it's a cd8 t- cell these are what are called the killer te- cells right and so this cell comes along and with its t- cell receptor the te- cell receptor meets the MHC class one receptor with the antigen in it and if that's a lock it realizes that's my Target and it begins to replicate and proliferate and Target those and that creates the immune response and by the way that's how it works when you vaccinate somebody you're basically pre-building that thing up so would this fall under the Adaptive immune response or the innate immune response though this is adaptive yep innate is just the pure antibody response in the on the B cell side I won't get into that for for for the purpose of this discussion the other example is MHC class two and that's also part of the Adaptive system or the innate system which uh is more what we call the um exogenous form so these are peptides that are usually coming from outside the cell so we're going to focus more on the MHC class one because this is peptides that come from inside the cell okay so just keep in the back of your mind if a foreign protein gets presented from inside a cell to outside a cell the te- cells recognize that and they will mount a foreign response and by the way that's why we basically can beat any virus like if you consider how many viruses are around us the fact that we almost never die from a viral infection is a remarkable achievement of how well this immune system works we're constantly combating these viruses constantly and by the way we don't really have very effective antiviral agents it's not like antibiotics like we have antibiotics up to Wazoo I mean we're way better at fighting viruses than bacteria can I just one question I've always wondered about this to what is our ability to ward off viruses on a day-to basis as an adult reliant on us having been exposed to that virus during development like like as I walk around today maybe I'll be exposed to 100, different viruses would you say that half of those I've already got antibodies too because I I was exposed to them at some prior portion of my life yeah hard quantify and the other ones I'm just building up antibodies like I was on I was on a plane last night someone was coughing so I was hiding I had Co a little while ago so I wasn't too worried about that and I feel great today but you know I just assume that on that plane I'm in a swamp of viruses no matter what and that most of them I've already been exposed to since I was a little kid so I've got all the antibodies and they're just fighting it back binding up those viruses and and and destroying them yeah I think it's part that and I also think it's part of them that our body can destroy without mounting much of an immune response so therefore your immune system is doing work and it's yet it's not mounting a systemic inflammatory response that you're not sensing so is it also a physical trapping in you know in my nasal epithelium it's a virus yeah so so yeah let like there you have huge barriers right so the skin you know the hairs in your nose all of these things are huge barriers but assuming that still a bunch of them are getting in at least the respiratory ones that's the other thing to keep in mind right there are certain viruses that are totally useless floating around the air right there are certain viruses you know the viruses that most people are really afraid of you know Hep C hepb HIV well you know if they're sitting on a table or floating around the air they're of no threat to you they have to be you know sort of transmitted through the barrier um but again some of these viruses you're going to defeat without an enormous response and then some of them you know like why is influenza quote unquote such a bad virus whereas the common respiratory cold kind of Sidelines you for a day it's the immune response that you're feeling the worse the bigger the immune response to the virus the more you're feeling that you feel your immune system going crazy right you know the in lucans that are spiking the third spacing that occurs to get more and more of the immune cells there the spike of your temperature as your body basically tries to cook the virus all of that stuff is your body yeah yeah you're being drained and all this happening so um one more point I'll mention just "

            "text": "but just to close the loop on the autoimmunity um how is it that we learn not to attack ourselves that's something called thymic selection that occurs in infancy so you and I have a no good for nothing tiny little thymus that would be it's almost impossible to see these things you know when we used to operate on people you know the thymus is barely visible in an adult in a healthy adult outside of thymic tumors but as a CH in a child the thymus is quite large and the purpose of the thymus is to educate te- cells and basically show the te- cells what self is and any te- cell that doesn't immediately recognize it gets killed so it's it's a really clever system where we basically teach you to recognize self at a very early age and if you can't do that you're weeded out and then the thymus involutes thereafter because it's sort of served its purpose okay now let's talk about cancer so what do we know about cancer so we know that again you know cancer is a genetic disease in the sense that every Cancer has genetic mutations um most of those mutations are sematic which means most of those mutations are mutations that occur during the course of our life they're not germline mutations the germline being the uh eggs and sperm right so it's all other cells and I love that you pointed out that you know there can be gen that cancer can be genetic but isn't necessarily inherited right people genetic and they think inherited right but inherited is always genetic to some extent but um genetic isn't always inherited yeah so there are a handful of cancers that are uh derived from inherited mutations so Lynch syndrome is an example of that uh hereditary polyposis is an example of that where you have a gene that gets passed through the germ line and that Gene codes for a protein like all genes do and it's either you have too much of a gene or too little of of a gene so it's either a gene that promotes cancer or and you have too much of that or it's a gene that prevents cancer and you have too little of it or a dysfunctional version of it right so braa is an example of that braa is hereditary braa codes for a protein and the the women and men but mostly the women that we think about who have a braa mutation that all in some cases almost guarantees breast cancer it's because of a defective copy so it's like they don't get the protein that they need to protect them from breast cancer so what do we know well we know that and this is probably one of the most remarkable things I've ever learned and it still blows my mind every time um well actually before I get to that point I want to make I want to make another Point okay so so you might think so cancer we we you know our cells become cancerous but they're clearly hijacked because they have these mutations and as a result of these mutations they make protein prots that allow cancers to behave differently and Cancers behave differently from non-cancer in two very critical ways the first way is that they do not respond to cell cycle signaling so if you cut your skin it heals but how does it know to heal just right and not to keep growing and growing and growing and growing and growing well it knows that because there are cell cycle signals that tell it time to grow time to stop if believe it or not this is an extreme example if you donated to me half of your liver which I know you would absolutely i' give you more than half my you give if it meant that we could keep doing these dral clubs right um within months you would regenerate a full liver that's so isn't that amazing that's so wow it's like a salamander you cut off a salamander Limb and please don't do that experiment because other people are doing it anyway and it grows back and it knows how much to grow back it's so wild so so when a cell is perfectly functioning it knows how much to grow and and it's well cancer loses that ability that is one of the Hallmarks of cancer it just keeps growing it doesn't grow faster by the way that's a misnomer people think cancers grow faster than non-cancer there's no real evidence that that's the case they just don't stop growing the second property of cancer is the capacity to leave the site of origin go someplace else and take up residence so that's metastasis that's the metastasis component so if you think about it for a minute a cell that never stops replicating and has the capacity to up and leave and move and take up residence is clearly different from the cell itself right so if I have a cell of colonic epithelium the cell that lines the inside of my colon it's clearly got a set of proteins in it but if all of a sudden that thing can grow grow grow grow grow not stop not stop not not listen to the signal and then somehow wind its way into the liver and just keep growing and growing and growing it must have different proteins so the question question then becomes why does cancer even exist how has our immune system not figured out a way to just silence this and eradicate it the way it does to virtually every virus you encounter and to me this is one of the most interesting questions in all of biology and it really comes down to how clever cancer is unfortunately how evolutionarily clever it is it basically does a lot of things to trick the immune system so it has its own secretory factors that Tamp down the immune system it grows in an environment because of its nature so one of the things that's long understood about cancer is it's heavily glycolytic and when something is heavily glycolytic it's going glucose to pyruvate to lactate nonstop there are lots of reasons for that um I think there's more than one the what does that afford it ises that a does that afford it a migratory potential no so it's super interesting so so that's the effect what I just described is called the warberg effect and when warberg proposed this uh which God was probably in the 1920s it was before World War I before World War II um he proposed it be he thought the mitochondria of cancer cells were defective so he proposed that the you know cancer cells mitochondria don't work hence they have to undergo glycolysis they can't undergo uh aerobic um uh metabolism um we now know that that's not the case so we now know that the the the warberg effect or the varberg effect if I'll refer to him correctly by his name um almost assuredly does not have to do with defective mitochondria others have proposed several mechanisms I think there's probably more than one thing going on so so so a paper that came out in 2009 very influential paper um by a guy named Matt vanderheiden and um Craig Thompson and uh Luke kley proposed that the reason that cancer cells do the warberg effect is that they're not optimizing for energy they're optimizing for cellular building blocks and if you do the mass balance it completely makes sense like dividing cells need building blocks more than energy and glycolysis while very inefficient for generating ATP is much more efficient at generating substrate to make more cells but another proposed mechanism is exactly at this one glycolysis lowers the surrounding pH because of lactate lactate attracts hydrogen pH goes down and guess what that does to the immune system detracts the immune system so it's also a way to hide from the immune system so there's a like a pH cloaking use leveraging pH to cloak the the signal that the immune system would otherwise see yep and then when you layer on top of that that it knows how to secrete things like il10 TGF beta all of these other secretory factors that also inhibit the immune system basically it's figured out a way to kind of hide itself from the immune system the way you describe it can sounds like a virus yes I mean it sounds a lot like a virus and that leads me to ask are there any examples of contagious cancers I recall seeing some studies about these little critters down in uh uh Australia Tasmanian devils that like they would uh they scratch each other in fight as Tasmanian devils do they're actually quite cute um and they would get cancers and tumors growing on their faces yes so so it and so it was it was like it was like a literal physical interaction that could transmit cancer from one animal to the next so it's less that there are viruses that cause cancer so in that sense you could argue yes there are contagious cancers well HPV sure yeah HPV hepb uh hepc uh but but there are even cancers like cutaneous cancers that arise from viruses but um I don't know if that's quite the same as what you're saying like no no it's they're both it what you're saying is an important point I mean uh we don't want to go down the the round a whole of of HPV but right that's increasing susceptibility to cervical cancer um now there's a vaccine against HPV right there wasn't when we were in college as we all knew um there was no vaccine but the um okay so but yeah direct transmission of cancers from one one organism to the next more rare yes okay so now here a moment ago I said there's "

            "text": "this really incredible thing about cancer that blows my mind and about our immune system which is that at least 80% of solid organ tumors and we're going to mostly talk about solid organ tumors because that's where the field of oncology has made very little progress so if you go back 50 years where has oncology made huge progress it's made great progress in uh blood tumors leukemias and some kinds of lymphomas in fact there's two kinds of lymphomas where the progress has been remarkable one has been in uh Hodgkins lymphoma and the other has also been in immunotherapy has been in a type of B cell lymphoma um where that B cell demonstrates uh or presents something called a cd19 receptor so in in in B cell lymphomas with cd19 imuno there's a very unique Niche immunotherapy we won't talk about that today called car therapy that has got rid of those guys and then leukemias have also been pretty good but in solid organ tumors there have been only two real breakthroughs in the last 50 years one has been the therapy for a certain type of IC cancer um and it's really just a chemotherapy cocktail that has been found to work really well and the other has been in this really rare kind of gastric cancer called The Gist stromal tumor which happens to result from one mutation in a kise pathway and there's one drug that can now Target that and it works it's kind of amazing cures that cancer cures that what I'm talking about are the cancers that kill virtually everybody else this is what when you sort of line up what are the big causes of cancer death let's start at the top it's lung it's then breast and prostate in men and women it's coloral it's pancreas those are the big five they kill more than 50% of Americans it cancer- wise not sorry let me restate that more than 50% of cancer deaths in Americans come from those five these are what we call the solid epithelial tumors and you can March down the list and most cancers that most people are thinking of are those cancers well here's the thing more than 80% of those cancers have antigens that are recognized by the host's immune system I will state it again because it is so profound 80% at least of those cancers actually generate an antigen meaning a little peptide in that cell gets presented to the te- cell and it is recognizable and now the question is why is that not sufficient to induce remission and the short answer is there are not enough te- cells that are able to act and or they are being sufficiently inhibited from acting which gets me to the point of this paper one of the ways in which the body inhibits the immune system which we should remind ourselves is an important thing right is something called the checkpoint inhibitor okay so go back to that idea that I talked about before you have an antigen presenting cell it brings up an MHC receptor with a peptide on it and there is a t- cell that is coming and I actually brought a diagram which we're going to I'm going to link to this CU I I don't want to make this too complicated but I really think that this figure is helpful to understand how these papers uh how these drugs work so the MHC receptor with the peptide is sitting there and it binds to the T t- Cell receptor on the t- cell but there is another receptor on the t- cell a ctla4 receptor and that binds to a receptor that I won't bother naming now because it's the the the names don't matter but there's another receptor on the antigen presenting cell that binds to that and that acts as the breaks in the reaction so ctla4 which is on the t- cell binds to another CD receptor on the antigen presenting cell and it says Tamp down the response and the reason for that is we want to keep our immune system in check this basically is a way of asking the immune system because remember when the immune system sees that antigen it wants to go nuts it wants to start replicating and killing that this is a cd8 cell it is a targeted killer t- cell the checkpoint says let's double check that let's be sure let's Tamp down the response and as a result of that a thought experiment emerged which was what if we block ctla4 what if we block the checkpoint could we unleash the immune system a little bit more and I will say this at the time it was proposed it seemed a bit far-fetched um because of the complexity of the immune system it seemed a little far-fetched that simply blocking the checkpoint would have any effect it's also worth noting that prior to this one immunotherapy had found some efficacy which was trying the exact opposite strategy rather than blocking the inhibitor it was throwing more accelerant at the fire which was giving something called inter Lucin 2 so interlukin 2 is for lack of a better word candy and fuel for te- cells so the idea was if we have te- cells that innately recognize a cancer antigen can we just give high doses of interlukin 2 and have them undergo proliferation and response and the answer turned out to be yes but only in two cancers melanoma and kidney cancer and only at very small levels about 10% of the population would respond to these things now look that's 10% of people who were going to be dead within 6 months because these are devastating Cancers and once they spread there are no treatments that have any efficacy whatsoever in fact I think media and survival for metast melanom at the time was probably 4 months so this was a very Grim death sentence um but the idea now was what about doing the exact opposite approach instead of trying to throw more uh fire at the t- cell what if we can take its breaks down less gas pardon me instead of giving more gas let's give less breaks and um there were some phase two some phase one studies that demonstrated efficacy phase two and the paper I'm "

            "text": "going to talk about today is the is the phase three uh uh U study that compared um the first version of these so so the the drug we're going to talk about today is an anti-la 4 drug called um iolab um there is another drug out there that came came along shortly thereafter that is um an anti- pd1 drug so pd1 uh turns out to be another one of these checkpoints on te- cells and the Nobel Prize by the way I think it was 2018 or 2019 in medicine or physiology was actually awarded to The two scientists who discovered ctla4 and pd1 so you know this I believe this is the only Nobel Prize in medicine for immunotherapy it's a very big deal so this study um sought to compare the effect of antict 4 to a placebo and the placebo in this case was not a real Placebo it was a peptide vaccine called GP100 um to ask the question in patients with metastatic melanoma what would be the impact on median survival and overall survival so um let's talk a little bit about the paper so again one of the funny things about this is um I used to read these papers a lot Andrew these these used to be these used to be my bread and butter papers so I I mean you know be you know reading these like I'm you know it's my hobby and and I don't read them that much anymore so it was kind of amazing how long it took me to remind myself of stuff I used to remember but you do have to kind of go back and read the methods and figure out who were the patients in this what was the eligibility criteria why did they do it this way and of course it all kind of came back to me but um it it took a minute so so so the first thing is these are all patients who um had progressed through every standard therapy so these are patients for whom there were no other options um these patients either had very Advanced stage three melanoma which means it was local Regional melanoma but it couldn't be reected so an example of that would be um a cancer that was you know completely engulfing like where let's say the primary site was the cheek and it had completely grown into all of the surrounding soft tissue it hadn't spread anywhere but it was you know all the lymph nodes of the neck um and and I've seen patients like this and it's you know it's just completely disfiguring um and they'd already been through the standard chemotherapy and nothing was working and the thing was growing and then it was mostly made up of patients with stage four cancer now melanoma has a very funny staging system so in cancer we typically talk about something called the tnm staging system it is the standard way that cancers are staged T refers to the tumor size n refers to the lymph node status and M refers to the presence or absence of metastases and for most cancers it is a very simple system it is you know T is typically a number one two sometimes up to three and four n is typically 0 1 or two and M is z or 1 either there's no Mets or there are Mets so for example in coloral cancer um the T staging determines the depth in the colon wall that it went n is did it go to Mets and I think in Colon I'm a little rusty on this I think colon has n01 or two depending on how many lymph nodes and then m0 did it go to anything beyond that like to the liver lung Etc or not melanoma is a bit more complicated it has m0 meaning no Mets but it also has M1 a m1b m1c C and m1d and within each of those it has a threshold for high and low lactate dehydrogenase or LDH so it's both a staging based on Imaging and biochemical and the reason for that is LDH level is such a strong prognostic indicator of survival in addition to M staging uh higher LDH levels tend to reflect more acidity which we talked about why that's problematic tends to reflect faster growing tumors higher turnover higher metabolic activity M1A let me see if I can remember this m1as are Cancers that have metastasized to um surrounding soft tissue or soft tissue anywhere in the body so anywhere else on the skin and you might think well that's kind of crazy like how does that happen and it's really bizarre you can have a patient who had a melanoma that showed up in one part of their body and then they have metastases on other parts of their skin m1b B is uh and I always get B and C confused I think B is the lung so m1b is to the lung m1c is to any internal organ so liver Etc and m1d is to the CNS and as those numbers increase as those letters increase the prognosis gets lower and lower and lower so one of the first things I always look "

            "text": "at when I look at a paper like this is tell me about the patient population like what what was the um you know what was the breakdown of patients and in table one so that's again in clinical papers like this table one is always always always Baseline characteristics um oh I should mention one other thing Andrew this was done as a 3: one: one randomization so again in the simplest form a study would have two groups right you would have um we're going to just have a treatment group and a placebo group but in this arm you had three groups with one of them being the place Placebo the placebo got just GP 100 which is just a cancer vaccine by the way this is a cancer vaccine that never showed any efficacy so it was a cancer vaccine that had been tested both with interlukin 2 directly and um as an adant for patients who had metastatic melanoma or had sorry not metastatic melanoma who had melanoma reected who were tumor free and then given the vaccine as adant to see did that have an effect on outcomes and it didn't so it's kind of a known Placebo so you had that group then you had the antict 4 group and then you had antict 4 plus GP 100 yeah what's the rationale for the 3:1: one it's basically it increases statistical power right so you know this total study was a little under 700 people they put 400 in the anti-la 4 plus gp1 100 group and then you you know little over 130 in each of the other two groups so you're always going to be able to make these two comparisons right what you can check by doing this is is there any effective GP 100 in this setting which had never been done before so again GP 100 is a known protein expressed by melanoma and all of these people were haplotyped to make sure that their immune system would recognize it and the question was would giving people anti C4 I.E taking the breaks off their immune system with or without gp00 make a difference so kind of going through this you can see it sort of skews about 60% to 40% male to female they talk about something called the ecog performance status that refers to how healthy a patient is coming in so ecog zero is no limitations whatsoever which is kind of amazing when you really consider something I think this speaks to just how devastating this disease is um these are patients who all have like 6 months to live right you know a year Max and yet look at this 58 to 60% of them have no limitation on their quality of life at this very moment that's going to change dramatically um you know absent a cure here and then ecog 1 has some limitation and you can see that EOG 1 plus ecog 0 is basically 98% of the population you can see the staging there so again very very few of these patients are the m0 category zeros are people who have stage three disease that is so aggressive it can't be reected that's about 1% but the majority of these people are the m1as M1 BS M1 C's so these are people with very aggressive cancers you can also see that about 10 to 15% of these people also have CNS metastases again the poorest prognosis of the poor and then you can see the uh about 40% of them have the LDH level above above cut off all of this is to say we're talking about a group of patients who have um you know a very high likelihood of not surviving more than you know a year it would be very you know unlikely that that many of these patients would survive more than a year so so basically More than 70% of these people have visceral metastasis uh a third have high LDH and 10 more than 10% have brain Mets they've also all progressed through standard therapy so um radiation chemo yeah and the chemo for for for melanoma can be you know kind of a toxic chemo that that really just doesn't really do anything so is it common place to use a treatment that failed in clinical trials as a placebo in these sorts of studies yeah it's interesting I I think you're referring obviously to the GP 100 and I think the thing thinking was okay it hasn't been effective in other treatments for example when combined with I2 or as an adant but never before has it been tried with a checkpoint inhibitor which is the technical term for this type of drug um I think there was also some belief that it would be easier to enroll patients I don't think they stated this but that's often the case it would be easier to enroll patients if they would know that even in the placebo arm they're still getting an active agent got it and I suppose there's always the possibility that the combination of the uh failed drug with a new drug would work and then so you're increasing the probability for novel Discovery for sure and again if you go back to the randomization of 3 to one: one it's really only 1 or 20% of the participants that would get just the GP 100 so in other words you're basically telling people when they come into this study there's an 80% chance you're going to get antict 4 that's a much better set of odds than you know your typical study where you're going to be 50% likely to get the uh agent of Interest right and people who are literally dying of cancer that they W they don't want to be in the control group right that's right so the primary outcome for this study actually changed "

            "text": "in the study now they have to get permission to do that um but the so the original primary end point was the best overall response rate so I have to explain how response rates are measured this is this is a bit complicated remember all of these patients by definition have measurable visible cancer by visible either on the surface of their body but more likely on an MRI or CT scan so all of these patients had to be scanned head totoe within 12 weeks of enrollment um again there's another thing I should point out here which I know you understand but it's always worth finding people when a study like this takes place it usually takes place over many years and so it's not the case that all 700 of these patients were enrolled on the same day and finished you know we finished observing them on the same day no no no this took place for a very long period of time this took place across tens of centers uh I can't remember if this was just globally or across the world it might have been across the world um and so every Center really needs to adhere to a very strict protocol and you have a central organiz ation that is running this so you have a drug company I think this is brist Bristol Meers squib that makes the drug they provide the drug and then you have a cro a clinical research organization that that is basically managing the trial and the trial is being done at Cancer Centers all over the world or all over the country and you know enrollment I think began in 2008 for this no no I think it completed in 2008 it probably started in about 2004 2005 and and therefore you had to kind of have real clear protocols around this so a complete response is the easier of these to understand a complete response is everything vanishes completely that's very rare in cancer therapy so instead what we kind of look for is a partial response a partial response and there is really different ways to Define this there are different criteria but this is the most common way you define a partial response a partial response is at least a 50% reduction by diameter because remember in this type Imaging you're looking at 2D versus 3D so if you're looking at a lung lesion and it's this big it you know if it's 2 centimeters long it has to go to at least 1 centimeter in diameter so it's a 50% reduction at least of every single lesion with no new lesions appearing and no lesions growing so it's very strict criteria right again CR means everything vanishes PR means at least a 50% by diameter which by the way is a much bigger diameter much bigger reduction in terms of tumor volume when you consider the linear versus the third power relationship of length and volume of every single lesion with nothing new appearing regardless of how small and no lesion growing so that's a PR so you basically have no response progression we talk about those together and then partial response and complete response so initially the the authors of this study were going to the primary end point of this was going to be the best overall response rate so what was the proportion of patients that hit PR what was the proportion that hit a CR um that's very common in this type of paper where the outcomes are typically so dire um however uh oh I think I said I think I said that the study was um I I don't remember when the study ended but the amendment was made to change the primary endpoint to overall survival um at some point during the study so and by the way that tends to be the metric everybody cares most about so the overall survival for metastatic melanoma is zero um with the exception of people who respond to interlukin 2 high do interlukin 2 and that will boost the overall survival rate to somewhere between 8 and 10% very very low these patients many of whom had already taken and progressed through interlukin 2 Let me refresh my memory on what percentage of those patients about a quarter of these patients had already taken high dose interlukin 2 and by definition the fact that they're in this study means they had already progressed through that that treatment had failed just reiterate um just kind of the state these patients are in so now let's look at figure one so again I'll describe it because I "

really familiar to people who look at you know any data that deal with survival it's called a Kaplan Meyer survival curve so on the xaxis for this curve is time and time here is shown in months and on the Y AIS is the overall survival at the very top 100% at the bottom 0% and it has three graphs or three curves that are superimposed on one another for each of the three groups again the control group which is the GP 100 the um anti-la 4 Group by itself and the ntla 4 plus GP 100 and one of the characteristics of a Kaplan Meyer curve is by definition they have to be decreasing in a monotonic fashion because it's cumulative overall survival that just means it can't like come down and go back up nobody comes back to life so once a person dies they are censored from the study and the curve drops and drops and drops and you can see that they kind of highlight and I actually think it makes the graph a little harder to read when they when they put some of those marks on there but what really becomes clear when you look at this is is that there's a key there's a clear distinction between the curve for the placebo group the gp00 group and the other two the two treatment groups now you'll note at the very end that the two treatment groups appear to separate a little bit I'll talk about that in a second so when I look at these Andrew I the first thing I always turned my attention to I can't resist I have to look at the right hand side of the graph cuz what is that really telling me right that the tale of this is showing me the true overall survival and I want to sort of figure out what is going on so in the GP 100 Group which is the placebo group it is kind of amazing to think that there is still one person who is alive at 44 months it's it's amazing I mean it's both sobering and amazing that like one person made it to 44 months um the next thing I ask myself is well how long did half of the people make it that's called median survival and to do that you go up to the Y AIS and you draw a little line from the 50 over and then you bring that down and and that's you know that's that's that's awfully low that's about yeah in fact the table will tell us exactly what that is because I think it's really hard to eyeball that stuff so let's go to so there's always a table that will accompany these things and let's pull up that table I've got this paper spread out over so many things let's Adverse Events where's our survival table here figure two subgroup analysis of overall survival it would probably be helpful if I stapled these things together because it would be EAS well this is always a trade-off actually for since this is a journal Club episode I I will say that stapling helps but it also prevents one from separating things out writing in the margin I like these little mini clips no Financial relationship to the mini clips either um just have to state that cuz I always get if you don't say that people go oh you must have a steak in these mini clips I like these little mini clips in fact I'm such a nerd I always have one of these uh pilot V5 v7s in my Pock on my pocket of my hip and then my pockets are always filled with um with these little mini clips and um but then again I have a friend who's a musician he's and he's always reigning guitar picks so you know it's an as far as occupational hazards go of being a nerd I'm a big fan of the mini clip as well but I I went without it today all right so thank you yes table two all right so so let's look at table two while looking at the Kaplan Meer curve because now this allows us to see a couple things by the way remember how I said there's like that one person who kind of is still alive in the treatment group well you can tell that he's not a complete responder he or she is not a complete responder because um under evaluation of therapy in table two it says best overall response and it says complete responders zero so there was Zero complete responders in the placebo there were two partial responders again a partial responder is um some lesions got smaller some got bigger stable disease is it didn't really change that much and Progressive disease is obviously it went beyond not when you say partial response like lesions got smaller are they literally just tracing the the circumference of one of these you know skin lesions and saying okay got bigger smaller you literally we' had rulers iny yep yep feels this feels so crude in terms of like like I mean it makes total sense but like in terms of like modern medicine oh like your lesion Grew From like 3 millimeters to 6 millim and that we literally like drawing little boundaries around little blotches on the skin yeah you're you're putting a little measuring tape on them now again most of these are happening in the Radiology Suite because most of the disease for these patients is inside the body body remember More than 70% of these patients had visceral metastases so liver soft tissue uh lung brain you know these are in fact if you include lung liver brain and viscera it's it's all the pretty much all the patients so most of this is looking at a CT scan or an MRI for the brain got it um okay so that's that's kind of the first thing "

            "text": "that comes up the median response rate should should be shown pretty prominently here so I'm looking through through this and where is median response maybe it's shown in a different table uh let's see not Disease Control rate time to [Music] progression I remember it's about 10 months but maybe that's just in the text yeah here it is so I thought this would be in a table but it's uh it's on page 75 of the paper it just reports it so and I'm sorry I misspoke um the 10 months was for the antict 4 plus gp00 and 6.4 months for the GP100 alone that's the control and then 10.1 for the ntla 4 alone okay so again I always and again I'm just always doing this I'm kind of going back to the paper to be like does that make sense and yeah you kind of called it right you said median survival was about eight well it turns out it's actually like six and change because cuz it has that little ding in it and it's out to a little past 10 on the two others so the net takeaway here is again just to put that in English because it's so profound 50% of the patients in the control group were dead in 6 months 50% of the patients in the treatment group both treatment groups were dead in 10 months so what that means in cancer speak is these drugs extended median Survival by four months now that's a that's an important concept you know when we think about how has cancer therapy changed over the past 50 years median survival for metastatic cancer has increased across the board so a person today with metastatic coloral cancer or woman today with metastatic breast cancer or a person with metastatic lung cancer these people will live longer with those diseases today thanks mostly to treatments this is not an early detection lead time bias issue this is treatments are allowing people to live longer and that's an important part of the story but it's only half of the story yet it often gets touted as the story the other half of the story and frankly the story that I think is more important is what is overall survival doing and if you go back to those answers the answer is zero so overall survival hasn't changed for solid epithelial tumors it is it was 0% in 1970 and it's 0% today everyone dies everyone dies from metastatic solid organ tumors now again there's those there's those Niche examples I gave you testicular cancer is now an exception um gomal tumors would be an exception and I'm not including leukemia and lymph FAS where now there are exceptions okay within not to try and be overly optimistic but if I look at the graph in figure one and I look out at the tail of the graph that's right um and for those that are just listening what I see and and I'm far less far less familiar with this type of work and this analyzing these type of data but what I see is that people in the placebo group They're All Dead except that one Yep they're basically all dead at 44 months y but when I look at the number how long it takes for everyone to be dead in the true treatment groups it's like 50 looks like 53 54 months or so well and they're and they're not dead that's the point they're hanging in there right so because you know an extra somebody who um lost both of my uh scientific advisers two of the three the other one to Suicide we've talked about this before but the other uh two to different cancer both had the bracka 2 mutation by the way um you know an extra 8 to 10 months with your kids or with your spouse or to quote unquote get your Affairs in order is is a big deal I mean it's still depressing in the sense that nobody survives long term but um you know an extra 10 months as long as one is not miserable in that time completely miserable um I mean that's e extra 10 months of living right well and and what's interesting here is you know the observation period stops and some of these patients are still going so what you're highlighting is kind of the point I want to make which is overall survival is the most important metric and it's the highest bar make no mistake about it and it's certainly not the bar any drug company is ever going to want to talk about for a cancer drug but why not because because they don't none of them work right like we don't have you know like drug they only want to talk about cures they don't want to talk they only want to talk about media and survival they want they only want to talk about extending media in survival and you know there are you know lots of people out there that are on this on this platform I don't need to get on to it but who will say like look it's a real racket in in oncology today where drugs that are extending median Survival by four weeks are being put on the market at a tune of you know $50 to $100,000 per treatment that's not uncommon in oncology uh there was one drug that was approved for pancreatic cancer I believe it extended median Survival by days and it cost $40,000 and it's being advertised as significant extens because it was that was a statistical significant Improvement in media and survival I'm just yeah so it's look it's really understandable why people are very skeptical of the Pharma industry and and I think you know a much more nuanced view is necessary clearly I don't think Pharma is all bad um but I really understand why people lose faith in Pharma when when you know these types of products somehow make regulatory approval does insurance cover these kinds of drugs uh it can in fact it often does it depends on the FDA approval of course and the indication um but a lot of times they do right so yeah there's a societal cost to these things um but but there's also a patient cost right so a lot of times insurance doesn't fully cover it and a patient has to Bear the the cost difference and on top of that you alluded to this a second ago which is what if your quality of life is dramatically compromised as a result of this treatment and yes statistically you're going to live 9 days longer or 3 weeks longer but at what cost to your health in those final remaining days and by the way you're potentially straddling your loved ones with enormous debt uh in your absence so it's it's a super complicated topic yeah there's a dignity component too I mean I've seen this in people dying you know at some point they become such a a diminished version of their former selves that they don't want to be seen by people that way so what is exciting about this drug although it's this paper "

            "text": "is not the one that shows it the reason I chose this paper Andrew is because it was the first approval a second drug came along that is an anti- pd1 drug that drug is called Kuda that drug turned out to be even better and had has even a greater response rate both in terms of median survival and overall survival but this was the landmark paper I also have slight bias here and I'll disclose in a moment why um but I but I think it just talks about very interesting biology so let's talk about a couple things that stuck stuck out to me in this paper um the first thing that stuck out to me and the authors didn't comment on it unless they did and I missed it is look at figure two so figure two is the um subgroup analyses where you're sort of showing a similar graph to the one you showed earlier right where you you show the response rate or the change in response between the groups and then you put the error bars on it and this is where we talk about how well it's a 95% confidence interval so does it touch the unity line so these are called like tornado plots typically and um what you'll notice is that in the top you're looking at um um sort of uh it's it's comparing the antict 4 with GP100 versus the gp1 100 and in the bottom you're looking at the anti ca4 versus the GP 100 so at a glance you can see GP 100 is not doing anything I mean that's the that's the first takeaway of comparing A to B um what I find most interesting is look at the subgroup analysis of females notice that in females while there's a trend towards risk reduction and this is risk reduction for overall mortality so again I just want to restate that the primary outcome of this trial was changed to overall survival which I think is the better outcome by the way and overall for all patients in when you compare antict 4 plus Placebo versus placebo there was a 31% risk reduction in overall mortality that's what that's that's the mathematical interpretation of what you're seeing at the tail end of that Kaplan Meyer curve longer living longer and it's a it sounds like a big difference and in some some sense it is a big difference it is for those people because you're really looking at basically 0% surviving in the placebo group versus 20% of people are still alive at 56 months in the treatment group but look that means 80% have died right um but notice that and and and and sori when you just look at the antict a 4 plus GP 100 in the subgroup B that Hazard ratio is even showing more compression it's a 36% reduction in risk of death um but notice that the females did not reach significance so in the in the first group they barely do and you can see that because the confidence interval runs from 0.55 to 0.92 and notice the error bar almost touches the line and in the second one it does not reach significance at all so I actually went and kind of did a little reading on this after and I said hey you know how much did this study was this an outlier study and it turned out it wasn't um and that about half the studies of antict 4 did indeed find that the drug was less effective in women than men which I found interesting now I couldn't find any great explanation for it but the most plausible explanations fit into two categories the first are maybe there are differences in the immune response to the drug if you're a man or a woman the second uh comes down to dosing I should have said this at the outset but of course these drugs are not like a pill where it's like everybody gets you know 50 milligrams of this they're all dosed based on weight so this study is dosed I believe at 3 milligrams per kilogram and because most men are heavier than women men are getting a higher dose than women and weight and body surface area an immune system like these things are not all perfectly linear so I I I kind of wonder if this difference is simply explained by men on average getting a higher dose than women interesting last thing I want to talk about here is in table "

            "text": "three so Table Three always an important table to look at in any paper is what are the adverse outcomes right what are the adverse effects of the drug yeah I spent some I spent a little bit of time with this and I I confess it it you know I definitely don't want cancer to the extent that I can avoid it but this table made me wonder whether or not I would also want to just avoid cancer treatment given the life extension provided I mean these Adverse Events are pretty uncomfortable they sound just to put just to put in perspective um and you always have to kind of you know be mindful of how many of these adverse events are occurring in people just because their disease is progressing so the first thing I always want to look at is total Adverse Events in all three groups not just grade so grade three and grade four are real toxicities right grade four toxicity is life-threatening toxicity by the way uh grade three is pretty significant toxicity grade one and two we typically just you know that's not that severe right the little rash put some cortico steroids on it it went away kind of thing okay so in the uh treatment plus GP 100 group 98 8.4% of people reported some event so all but 1.6% in the ntct 4 group alone it was 96.7% so only 3.1% did not but in the placebo group it's 97% so it's important to keep in mind like you know everybody's having some adverse effect okay well what if you say well let's just limit it to the most severe events well let's just talk about grade four toxicities there were 6.1% of those in the placebo group 8.4% in the anti ca4 group and 6.8% in the combined group so not a huge difference in grade four toxicity meaning that whatever adverse events are occurring may not be related to they may not be related to the treatment the again these are if you if you think about it and it's a very awful sad morbid thought to imagine these are you're looking at the adverse responses of people more than 80% of whom died during the course of a very very short study and so you know it's very difficult to disentangle what effects or what side effects a person is having just from that process uh as they are from the actual treatment but if there is an area where there's a really clear difference it's down in the autoimmune category so if you look at any immune related events you can see that in the anti C4 plus gp1 100 group it's about 60% in both of those treatment groups versus 30% and if you look at the grade three and four toxicities it's 10% in the uh antict 4 15% in the um antict 4 alone group and only 3% in the treatment so that's a real difference well it makes sense that people getting this drug plus Placebo or just the drug would have autoimmune issues because this is an immunotherapy it's an immunomodulator in fact what is it doing it is taking the breakes off the immune system but then again the things that they list out puitis is that a irritation of the skin yeah irritation of the skin I'm not a physician but I know that any itis is going to be like an inflammation and unfortunately likely a cancer or cell replication look at the difference in viigo I mean um wow yeah so very or sorry sorry look at the gastro intestinal differences yeah and the Vitiligo right so 3.7% 2.3% 8% the GI stuff is the most common stuff you're going to see there those are those are the really big ones now and of course there's diarrhea and there's diarrhea oh like there's traveler diarrhea there's overly spicy large me4 diarrhea and then there's like can't really do anything besides make trips back and forth to the bathroom di well there's there's there's put it this way there's you know colitis here is diarrhea so significant these patients require ire IV fluids now what what you don't see here is how many of these patients actually required corticosteroids to reverse the autoimmunity so a lot of times what will happen here in these studies or with these drugs is the autoimmunity becomes so significant that you have to stop the drug and give cortico steroids do the exact opposite you now have to shut the immune system down so you just took the brakes off it with the drug and now you need to shut it down with corticosteroids um when I was was I in med school no when I was in my uh Fellowship um I wrote a paper about um autoimmunity correlating with response rate in ncta 4 uh early on this was during the phase two work so you so the NCI was a very early um uh uh adopter of U participating in these trials and um you know it was observed that or at least hypothesize this is what the paper basically wrote about which was is there any correlation between autoimmunity and response um and it turned out the answer was yes there was a very strong correlation so there was no difference in autoimmunity between the doses and the so the paper we wrote was two dosing schedules so it was basically the full dose the three milligrams per kilogram versus a low dose 1 milligram per kilogram this is a phase two trial those are your two arms they're turned out to no difference in autoimmunity between them but there was a big difference between um uh the response rate that tied to autoimmunity in other words autoimmunity predicted response now I think over time these U investigators the doctors who administer these treatments are getting better and better at catching these things earlier because these autoimmune conditions uh can actually be devastating so on a very personal note when k truda uh came out I "

            "text": "want to say it was around 200 11 no no no gosh it must have been 2013 2014 thereabouts um again it was for treatment of metastatic melanoma I want to come back and explain why melanoma gets all of the attention in autoimmune condition in in um um immunotherapy conditions I'll state that but um but anyway a friend of mine got pancreatic cancer and he got um the bad type of pancreatic cancer so this is uh an like the um um adenocarcinoma in the pancreas right so this this is a a non-survivable type of cancer furthermore his was unresectable so can you explain what that is yeah so the only so about 20% of people who have pancreatic cancer technically have it in a way where you could still take out the head of the pancreas right the Whipple procedure the Whipple procedure um now tragically most of those patients will still recur my understanding it is that pancreatic cancer progresses from anterior to posterior in the pancreas and that the Whipple is a removal of the front end the anterior that's the Whipple procedure so if the cancer has progressed far enough coddle into the posterior uh pancreas then there's nothing left to cut out basically um can we survive without a pancreas for any amount of time oh yeah absolutely so why don't they just remove the whole pancreas oh that's my point it's already microm metastized so it's not the the surgical procedure is not the challenge anymore it used to be so you know at John's Hopkins which is one of the hospitals where this was pioneered like the the 30-day mortality for a Whipple procedure was I don't know 80% and the reason was to figure out how to suture a pancreas to the bowel without the so so the pancreas is such an awful organ to operate on because its enzyme are designed to digest anything and everything so imagine now you have to cut the pancreas in half take out the head of the pancreas with the duodenum and then somehow sew that open half of a raw pancreas to the end of the junam and not let it digest itself someone at Hopkins figure this out um now the first one was actually done by AO Whipple but yes at Hopkins is where they figured out the way to put drains in the surgical technique how to do it in two layers what type of stitches to use like all of the nuances of this were worked out in a few places but I would say Hopkins more than any place else and are there Physicians who like try this on non-human primates or something or is this always just done on patients and you well nowadays I mean put it this way even 25 years ago at a at a at a major Center like Hopkins the the mortality of that procedure was less than 1% amazing yeah have been some vict well yes but here's my point it that that's no longer the bottleneck right taking out the pancreas safely as complicated and challenging as that is and if you need a whip procedure you only want to have it done by someone who just does that night and day because it's you don't want Weekend Warriors doing it um that's not why people are living or dying they're dying because the pan the cancer just comes back it was already spread to the liver by the time you did it you just didn't realize it yet so whether you took out the whole pancreas or the head of the pancreas or the tail of the pancreas the location of the tumor is predictive of survival only in the extent that it basically is a window into how soon did symptoms occur so pancreatic cancers in the tail tend to be more fatal even though they're way easier surgically to take out because by the time you develop symptoms of a tail pancreas cancer it's it's a big cancer so I was going to ask this question lat later but I'll just ask it now given the link between the immune system and these cancers is there an idea in mind that people who are let's say 40 and older or 50 and older who don't yet they're not diagnosed with any cancer would periodically just stimulate their immune system to wipe out whatever early cancers might be cropping up you know just take a drug to just ramp up the immune system even to the point where you're start having a little diarrhea maybe a few skin rashes and then come off the drug you know just basically to to fight back whatever little cell growths are starting to take place in skin or liver you know maybe for you know three weeks out of each year I mean why not yeah that's an interesting question um I've never thought of it through that lens I suppose the question is what can we do to keep our immune systems as healthy as possible as we age because stay on a normal circadian schedule there's evidence for that sure no there's evidence that certainly if it promotes sleep anything that promotes better rest is going to promote immune Health um because if you ask the macro question which is like why does the prevalence of cancer increase so dramatically with age um there are certain diseases where it's really obvious why the prevalence of the disease increases with age yeah like mac like uh age related macular degeneration sure or cardiovascular disease is by far the most obvious because it's an area under the curve exposure problem the more exposure to lipoproteins and the more the endothelium gets damaged the more likely you are to accumulate plaque and again it totally makes sense why 10year olds don't have heart attacks and 80y olds do but when you sort of acknowledge that well hey you know can't you know anybody's Accu accumulating genetic mutations we're always surrounded and being bombarded by things that are altering the Genome of our cell is it simply a stochastic process where the longer you live the more of these mutations are going to occur until at some point one of them just wins I I I think that's got to be a big part of it but I think another part of it and I clearly I'm not alone in thinking this is that our immune system is getting weaker and weaker as we age right I mean you know we you know people become more susceptible to infections as they get older uh and I think that that's equally playing a role in our susceptibility to cancer so yeah I think the question is how do you modulate immunity um as you age and to me that's one of the most interesting things about rapy potentially is that when taken the right way it seems to enhance um cellular immunity which again that that's potentially a really big deal again at least in in short-term human experiments in response to vaccination it's enhancing vaccine response so the question is would that translate into cancer nobody knows could that be one of the reasons why animals treated with rap ayin live longer and get less cancer don't know you know it could also be that it's it's at a fundamental level that's targeting nutrient sensing um where I was going with that story was that and maybe I'll back up for a moment why "

            "text": "melanoma so we didn't really know this like 30 40 years ago in the early days of immunotherapy but what we know now is that most cancers probably have about 40 mutations in them that's like ballpark 4050 mutations is standard fair for a cancer but melanoma happens to be one of the cancers that has many many more mutations and the more mutations a cancer has the more likelihood that it will produce an antigen that's recognized as non-self and that's why in the early days of immunotherapy the only things that worked were I2 against metastatic melanoma and kidney cancer because kidney cancer turned out to also be one of those cancers that for reasons that are not clear produced hundreds of mutations and so it's no surprise that the early studies of checkpoint Inhibitors were also done in metastatic melanoma where you basically have more shots on goal again if I'm going to take the breaks off my immune system I might as well do it in an environment where there are more chances for my tea cells to find something to go nuts against so it's 2013 2014 and this friend of mine who has something called Lynch syndrome um which is a one of those few hereditary or germline mutations that results in a huge increase in the risk of cancer he had already had colon cancer at about the age of 40 um and had survived that it was a stage three cancer but he had survived it well now five years later had developed uh pancreatic cancer and when he went to see the surgeon um they said said yeah we there's nothing we can do like it's too advanced so that's you know to put that in perspective that is a death sentence and that's not uh that that's a that's a six-month survival and at around that time there was a study that had come out in the New England Journal of Medicine that had talked about how patients with Lynch syndrome had lots of mutations and so we you know talked with his doctors about the possibility of enrolling him in one of the Kuda trials there was one going on I think at Stanford and you know the thinking being well you know you would want to Target a checkpoint inhibitor against somebody who has a lot of mutations and even though typically we don't see that in pancreatic cancer his is a unique variant of it because it's based on this and so sure enough he was tested for these mismatch repair genes he had them enrolled in the trial and amazingly had not only a complete regression of his cancer and he's still alive in cancer free today 10 years later but this the the the treatment worked so well at activating his immune system that his immune system completely destroyed his pancreas so now he is effectively had a pancreatectomy based on his immune system so now he actually has Type 1 diabetes he has no pancreas he injects insulin to deal with that or no he no no he has to use insulin just like someone with type di he had to pick being alive with type one diabetes yeah of course no comparison but it's just an interesting example of how you know remarkable this treatment was able to work when you were you know you could completely unleash the immune system of a person and you eradicate the cancer and the rest of the cells around it and and you know there are many organs we could live without um you know there are certain organs you can't live without you can't live without your heart lungs liver kidneys um but but many things that kill people arise from organs the breast you could live without all breast tissue prostate prostate you could live without all prostate tiue would choose to do to live without these but right but I'm saying if you if if you had metastatic cancer and you had a bullet that could selectively Target a tissue you would take it and right now the only tissue we can do that against is a cd19 B cell and that's what those car T cells are so right now these are not tissue specific treatments but they're mutation specific what the last thing I'll say about this paper that I found interesting and I I was looking for it and I was surprised they didn't at all comment on if there was any correlation between autoimmunity and response um so they obviously acknowledge the autoimmunity in in table three but I would have loved to have seen a statistical analysis that said hey is there any correlation between response rate and autoimmunity but um they they didn't comment to that effect so we're left kind of wondering what the current state of that is and I guess in summary I'll say that the reason I "

            "text": "thought this was an interesting paper to present is that I still believe that immuno theapy is probably the most important hope we have for treating cancer and well I think we're still only scratching the surface of it so collectively the overall survival increase for patients with metastatic solid organ tumors is about 8% better than it was 50 years ago and virtu all of that has come from some form of immunotherapy um I think is promising and I think the Holy Grail is the meaning the next step if you go back to where we started the discussion is coming up with ways to engineer te- cells to be even better recognizers of antigens and there's many ways to do that one is to directly engineer them another is to find te- cells that have already migrated into tumors those are called tumor infiltrating lymphocytes or till and expanding those and Engineering them to be better and younger is it possible to engineer our own te- cells to be more pH variant tolerant meaning um since this you know cloaking of the of a local area by changing the pH can could we you know pull some te- cells I'm I'm always thinking about the inoculation stuff like pull some te- cells as part of our standard exam when we're 30 and um you know and grow some up in an environment that the pH is is slightly more acidic than um than normal and then reintroduce them to the body I mean after all they are our tea cells um in other words give them a little opportunity to evolve the the conditions they can thrive in right or even just keep them in the freezer in case we need them yes so so the interesting thing is I don't know that if you just got them to be comfortable in a lower p pH it would be sufficient because there are still so many other things that the uh cancer is doing as far as using other secreting factors um it seems that by far the most potent thing comes down to expanding the number of te- cells that recognize the antigen and making sure that you can get that number big enough without aging them too much so in some senses it has become a long longevity problem of te- cells the way to think about it is you want an army of soldiers who are wise enough to recognize the bad guys which comes with age but young enough to go and kill and right now both extremes seem to be unhelpful right when you go and find tumor infiltrating lymphocytes in a tumor they're very wise they know which one they've demonstrated that they can do everything they can outmaneuver the cancer but they're too old to do anything about it and when you take them out to try to expand them by three logs which is typically what you need to do expand them by a thousandfold they can't do anything got it and what about avoiding melanoma altogether I mean obviously avoiding sunburn you know I somehow I got couched as anti-s sunscreen and that is absolutely not true I I said some sunscreens contain things that are clearly immune disrupt uh endocrine excuse me disruptors and we're going to do a whole episode on sunscreen maybe we could do some Journal I'm actually planning something on that as well I want and some dermatologists reached out um some very very skilled dermatologists reached out and said that indeed some sunscreens are are downright dangerous but of course melanoma is super dangerous um physical barrier no one disputes physical barriers for sunscreen like everyone everyone agrees that that is unlikely to have endrine disruption um so physical barriers are Undisputed but aside from limiting U sunlight exposure to the skin um what are some other risks for melanoma I mean I think that's the biggest one I do not believe that smoking poses a risk for melanoma and if it does it's going to be very small um there are hereditary cases so one needs to be pretty mindful when taking a family history and by the way there are really weird genetic um conditions that link melanoma to other cancers such as pancreatic cancer by the way so whenever I'm taking somebody's family history and I hear about somebody that had melanoma and someone that had pancreatic cancer I'm there's a couple genetics genetic tests we'll look at to to see if that's a person that's particularly sensitive just and a from a genetic predisposition um but I do think that first and foremost it's and by the way I think with melanoma the although it's not completely agreed upon I think it's less about sun exposure and more about sunburn right so so and again I'm sure there's somebody listening to this who will chime in and apply a more nuanced response to that um but but I think there's a there's a fundamental difference between I'm out in the sun getting Sun making some vitamin D versus I'm getting scorched and un you know undergoing significant UV damage there might also be something to be said for the time in one's life and i' I've certainly seen things that suggest that early you know early repeated sunburns would be more of a risk um so look I I think that's not a controversial point in the sense that like who wants to be sunburned right so it's like whatever one needs to do to be sunburned whether it's you know you know being mindful of what the UV index is wearing the appropriate cover wearing the appropriate sunscreen um I also find the whole uh kind of anti-s sunscreen establishment to be a little bit odd well the anti sunscreen establishment is odd you know I'm trying to open the door for a Nuance discussion about you know the fact that some sunscreens really do contain things like oxy benzines and things that are real and you're spraying them on kids you just look at the straight you know the good oldfashioned mineral sunscreens um perfectly safe yeah yeah as far as we know I mean I I also uh dare we uh cross the seed oil debate into this some of the folks who are really anti- seed oil also claim that seed oils increase risk for sunscreen uh Peter and I are smiling because we we have teed up uh a debate soon with some you know anti-ed oil and less anti-ed oil um experts so that that's forthcoming that's going to be a fun one we'll be doing all of that with our shirts on I really appreciate you um walking us through this paper Peter I've never looked at a paper on cancer um and certainly not one like this um I learned a lot and um it's such an interesting field obviously because of the importance of getting people with cancer to survive longer and Lead better lives but also um because of the the interaction with the immune system so we learned some really important immun ol yeah and this was this was great I uh I I feel much more confident now in the uh belief that the the exposure to light early and late in the day can actually have have benefits and I and as I said I think that there's I think there's there's some causality here and I think it shouldn't be ignored cool well this was our second Journal Club I look forward to our third next time you'll go first we'll just keep alternating and we've also switched venues but um we both wore the the correct shirt uh and um I hope uh people are learning um and not just learning the information but learning how to parse and think about papers and I certainly learned from you Peter thank you so much yeah thanks Andrew this is great thank you for "

    "episode_summary": "In this journal club episode, my guest is Dr. Peter Attia, M.D., a Stanford and Johns Hopkins-trained physician focusing on healthspan and lifespan and the host of The Drive podcast.\nWe each present a peer-reviewed scientific paper chosen because it contains novel, interesting, and actionable data. First, we discuss a paper on how bright light exposure at sunrise and throughout the day and dark exposure at night independently improve mental health and can offset some of the major symptoms of mental health disorders such as depression and anxiety. Then, we discuss an article that explores a novel class of immunotherapy treatments to combat cancer. We also discuss some of the new data on low-calorie sweeteners and if they are safe. This episode should be of interest to listeners curious about maximizing their vitality and longevity and to anyone seeking science-supported ways to improve mental health and lifespan.\nFor show notes, including referenced articles and additional resources, please visit hubermanlab.com.\nThank you to our sponsors\nAG1: https://drinkag1.com/huberman\nEight Sleep: https://www.eightsleep.com/huberman\nBetterHelp: https://betterhelp.com/huberman\nJoovv: https://joovv.com/huberman\nLMNT: https://drinklmnt.com/huberman\nMomentous: https://livemomentous.com/huberman"
