            "text": "And thank you for having\nme here in your home.MARK ZUCKERBERG: Oh, Thanks\nfor having us on the podcast.PRISCILLA CHAN: Yeah.ANDREW HUBERMAN: I'd like to\ntalk about the CZI, the ChanZuckerberg Initiative.I learned about this\na few years ago,when my lab was-- and\nstill is now-- at Stanford,as a very exciting\nphilanthropic effortthat has a truly big mission.I can't imagine\na bigger mission.So maybe you could tell us\nwhat that big mission is.And then we can get into\nsome of the mechanics of howthat big mission can\nbecome a reality.PRISCILLA CHAN: So like\nyou're mentioning, in 2015,we launched the Chan\nZuckerberg Initiative.And what we were\nhoping to do at CZIwas think about how do we build\na better future for everyoneand looking for ways\nwhere we can contributethe resources that we have\nto bring philanthropicallyand the experiences that\nMark and I have had,for me as a physician\nand educator,for Mark as an\nengineer, and thenour ability to bring teams\ntogether to build the builders.Mark has been a builder\nthroughout his career.And what could we\ndo if we actuallyput together a team to build\ntools, do great science?And so within our\nscience portfolio,we've really been focused\non what some people thinkis either an incredibly\naudacious goalor an inevitable goal.But I think about\nit as somethingthat will happen if we\ncontinue focusing on it, whichis to be able to cure,\nprevent, or manageall disease by the\nend of the century.ANDREW HUBERMAN: All disease?PRISCILLA CHAN: All disease.So that's important, right?And so a lot of times, people\nask like, which disease?And the whole point is that\nthere is not one disease.And it's really about taking\na step back to where I alwaysfound the most hope\nas a physician, whichis new discoveries\nand new opportunitiesand new ways of understanding\nhow to keep people well comefrom basic science.So our strategy at CZI is really\nto build tools, fund science,change the way basic\nscientists can see the worldand how they can move\nquickly in their discoveries.And so that's what\nwe launched in 2015.We do work in three ways.We fund great scientists.We build tools-- right\nnow, software toolsto help move science along and\nmake it easier for scientiststo do their work.And we do science.You mentioned Stanford\nbeing an important pillarfor our science work.We've built what we call\nbiohubs, institutes where teamscan take on grand\nchallenges to do work thatwouldn't be possible\nin a single labor within a single discipline.And our first\nbiohub was launchedin San Francisco, a\ncollaboration between Stanford,UC Berkeley, and UCSF.ANDREW HUBERMAN: Amazing.Curing all diseases implies\nthat there will eitherbe a ton of knowledge gleaned\nfrom this effort, whichI'm certain there will be--\nand there already has been.We can talk about some of those\nearly successes in a moment.But it also sort of implies\nthat if we can understand"

            "text": "some basic operations\nof diseases and cellsthat transcend autism,\nHuntington's, Parkinson's,cancer and any other\ndisease that perhaps thereare some core principles that\nwould make the big missiona real reality, so to speak.What I'm basically saying is,\nhow are you attacking this?My belief is that the cell sits\nat the center of all discussionabout disease, given that\nour body is made up of cellsand different types of cells.So maybe you could\njust illuminate for usa little bit of what the\ncell is, in your mind,as it relates to disease and\nhow one goes about understandingdisease in the context of cells\nbecause, ultimately, that'swhat we're made up of.MARK ZUCKERBERG: Yeah.Well, let's get to the\ncell thing in a moment.But just even taking\na step back from that,we don't think,\nat CZI, that we'regoing to cure, prevent\nor manage all diseases.The goal is to basically\ngive the scientific communityand scientists around\nthe world the toolsto accelerate the\npace of science.And we spent a lot\nof time, when wewere getting started\nwith this, lookingat the history of science and\ntrying to understand the trendsand how they've\nplayed out over time.And if you look over\nthis very long-term arc,most large-scale\ndiscoveries are precededby the invention of a new tool\nor a new way to see something.And it's not just\nin biology, right?It's like having\na telescope camebefore a lot of discoveries\nin astronomy and astrophysics.But similarly, the microscope\nand just different waysto observe things or\ndifferent platforms,like the ability to do\nvaccines preceded the abilityto cure a lot of\ndifferent things.So this is the engineering part\nthat you were talking about,about building tools.We view our goal is to\ntry to bring togethersome scientific and engineering\nknowledge to build toolsthat empower the whole field.And that's the big arc\nand a lot of the thingsthat we're focused on, including\nthe work in single celland cell understanding,\nwhich you can jump in and getinto that if you want.But yeah, I think I\nthink we generallyagree with the\npremise that if youwant to understand this\nstuff from first principles--people study organs a lot right.You study how things\npresent across the body.But there's not a very\nwidespread understandingof how each cell operates.And this is a big part of\nsome of the initial workthat we tried to do on the Human\nCell Atlas and understandingwhat are the different cells.And there's a bunch\nmore work that we wantto do to carry that forward.But overall, I think, when we\nthink about the next 10 yearshere of this long arc to\ntry to empower the communityto be able to cure, prevent\nor manage all diseases,we think that the next\n10 years should reallybe primarily about being\nable to measure and observemore things in human biology.There are a lot\nof limits to that.It's like you want to look at\nsomething through a microscope,you can't usually\nsee living tissuesbecause it's hard to see through\nskin or things like that.So there are a lot of\ndifferent techniquesthat will help us\nobserve different things.And this is where the\nengineering backgroundcomes in a bit because--I mean, when I think about this\nis from the perspective of howyou'd write code or\nsomething, the idea of tryingto debug or fix a code base,\nbut not be able to stepthrough the code\nline by line, it'snot going to happen, right?And at the beginning of any\nbig project that we do at Meta,we like to spend a bunch of\nthe time up front just tryingto instrument things\nand understandwhat are we going to\nlook at and how are wegoing to measure things so\nwe know we're making progressand know what to optimize.And this is such a\nlong-term journeythat we think that it actually\nmakes sense to take the next 10years to build those\nkinds of tools for biologyand understanding just how the\nhuman body works in action.And a big part of\nthat is, cells.I don't know.Do you want to jump and talk\nabout some of the efforts?PRISCILLA CHAN: Sure.ANDREW HUBERMAN: Could I just\ninterrupt briefly and just ask"

            "text": "about the different\ninterventions, so to speak,that CZI is in a unique\nposition to bring to the questto cure all diseases?So I can think of--I mean, I know, as a scientist,\nthat money is necessary but notsufficient, right?When you have money, you\ncan hire more people.You can try different things.So that's critical.But a lot of philanthropy\nincludes money.The other component is you\nwant to be able to see things,as you pointed out.So you want to know that\nnormal disease process--like, what is a healthy cell?What's a diseased cell?Are cells constantly being\nbombarded with challengesand then repairing those?And then what we\ncall cancer is justa runaway train of\nthose challengesnot being met by the cell\nitself or something like that?So better imaging tools.And then it sounds like there's\nnot just a hardware component,but a software component.This is where AI comes in.So maybe, at some point,\nwe can break this upinto two, three\ndifferent avenues.One is understanding\ndisease processesand healthy processes.We'll lump those together.Then there's hardware--\nso microscopes,lenses, digital\ndeconvolution, waysof seeing things in bolder\nrelief and more precision.And then there's how\nto manage all the data.And then I love the\nidea that maybe AIcould do what human\nbrains can't do alone,like manage\nunderstanding of the databecause it's one thing\nto organize data.It's another to say, oh,\nthis as you point outin the analogy with code,\nthat this particular geneand that particular gene\nare potentially interesting,whereas a human\nbeing would nevermake that potential connection.MARK ZUCKERBERG: Yeah.PRISCILLA CHAN: So\nthe tools that CZIcan bring to the table--we fund science, like\nyou're talking about.There's lots of ways\nto fund science.And just to be\nclear, what we fundis a tiny fraction of what\nthe NIH funds, for instance.ANDREW HUBERMAN: So you guys\nhave been generous enoughthat it definitely holds\nwait to NIH's contribution.PRISCILLA CHAN: Yeah.But I think every funder has\nits own role in the ecosystem.And for us, it's\nreally, how do weincentivize new points of view?How do we incentivize\ncollaboration?How do we incentivize\nopen science?And so a lot of our grants\ninclude inviting peopleto look at different fields.Our first neuroscience RFA was\naimed towards incentivizingpeople from different\nbackgrounds-- immunologists,microbiologists--\nto come and lookat how our nervous system works\nand how to keep it healthy.Or we ask that our\ngrantees participatein the pre-print\nmovement to acceleratethe rate of sharing knowledge\nand actually others beingable to build upon science.So that's the\nfunding that we do.In terms of building, we\nbuild software and hardware,like you mentioned.We put together\nteams that can buildtools that are more durable\nand scalable than someonein a single lab might\nbe incentivized to do.There's a ton of great ideas.And nowadays, most scientists\ncan tinker and buildsomething useful for their lab.But it's really\nhard for them to beable to share that\ntool sometimesbeyond their own laptop\nor forget the next Labover or across the globe.So we partner with scientists\nto see what is useful,what kinds of tools.In imaging, Napari, it's\na useful image annotationtool that is born from\nan open source community.And how can we\ncontribute to that?Or a CELLxGENE, which works\non single cell data sets.And how can we make it build a\nuseful tool so that scientistscan share data sets,\nanalyze their ownand contribute to a larger\ncorpus of information?So we have software teams that\nare building, collaboratingwith scientists to make\nsure that we're buildingeasy to use, durable,\ntranslatable toolsacross the scientific community\nin the areas that we work in.We also have institutes-- this\nis where the imaging work comesin-- where we are proud owners\nof an electron microscoperight now.It's going to be installed\nat our imaging institute.And that will really\ncontribute to the waywhere we can see\nwork differently.But more hardware does\nneed to be developed.We're partnering with\nthe fantastic scientistsin the biohub network to build\na mini-phase plate to increaseto align the electrons through\nthe electron microscopeto be able to increase\nthe resolution,so we can see in sharper detail.So there's a lot of innovative\nwork within the network that'shappening.And these institutes\nhave grand challengesthat they're working on.Back to your\nquestion about cells,"

            "text": "cataloged the total number\nof different cell types?Every week, I look\nat great journalslike Cell Nature and Science.And for instance, I saw\nrecently that, using single cellsequencing, they've categorized\n18 plus different typesof fat cells.We always think of like a fat\ncell versus a muscle cell.So now, you've got 18 types.Each one is going to express\nmany, many different genesand mRNAs.And perhaps one of\nthem is responsiblefor what we see in\nadvanced type 2 diabetes,or in other forms of obesity,\nor where people can't lay downfat cells, which turns out\nto be just as detrimentalin those extreme cases.So now, you've got all\nthese lists of genes.But I always thought of single\ncell sequencing as necessary,but not sufficient, right?You need the information, but\nit doesn't resolve the problem.And I think of it more as\na hypothesis-generatingexperiment.OK, so you have all these genes.And you can say, well,\nthis gene is particularlyelevated in the diabetic\ncell type of, let's say,one of these fat cells or\nmuscle cells for that matter,whereas it's not\nin non-diabetics.So then of the millions\nof different cells,maybe only five of them\ndiffer dramatically.So then you generate\na hypothesis.Oh, it's the ones that\ndiffer dramaticallythat are important.But maybe one of those genes,\nwhen it's only 50% changed,has a huge effect because of\nsome network biology effect.And so I guess what I'm\ntrying to get to hereis how does one\nmeet that challenge.And can AI help\nresolve that challengeby essentially placing\nthose lists of genesinto 10,000 hypotheses?Because I'll tell you\nthat the graduate studentsand postdocs in my lab\nget a chance to test onehypothesis at a time.PRISCILLA CHAN: I know.ANDREW HUBERMAN: And that's\nreally the challenge,let alone one lab.And so for those\nthat are listeningto this-- and\nhopefully, it's notgetting outside the scope\nof standard understandingor the understanding\nwe've generated here.But what I'm\nbasically saying is,you have to pick at some point.More data always sounds great.But then how do you\ndecide what to test?PRISCILLA CHAN: So no, we\ndon't know all the cell types.I think one thing that was\nreally exciting when we firstlaunched this work\nwas cystic fibrosis.Cystic fibrosis is caused\nby mutation in CFTR.That's pretty well known.It affects a certain channel\nthat makes it hard for mucusto be cleared.That's the basics\nof cystic fibrosis.When I went to medical\nschool, it was taught as fact.ANDREW HUBERMAN: So their\nlungs fill up with fluid.These are people who\nare carrying aroundsacks of fluid filling up.PRISCILLA CHAN: Yep.ANDREW HUBERMAN: I've worked\nwith people like that.And they have to literally\ndump the fluid out.PRISCILLA CHAN: Exactly.ANDREW HUBERMAN: They can't\nrun or do intense exercise.Life is shorter.PRISCILLA CHAN: Life is shorter.And when we applied single-cell\nmethodologies to the lungs,they discovered an\nentirely new cell typethat actually is affected by\na mutation in the CF mutation,in cystic fibrosis\nmutation, thatactually changes\nthe paradigm of howwe think about cystic fibrosis.ANDREW HUBERMAN: Amazing.PRISCILLA CHAN: [? Just ?]\n[? unknown. ?] So I don't thinkwe know all the cell types.I think we'll continue\nto discover them.And we'll continue to discover\nnew relationships between celland disease, which leads me\nto the second example I wantto bring up, is\nthis large data setthat the entire\nscientific community hasbuilt around single cell.It's starting to allow us to\nsay this mutation, where is itexpressed?What types of cell\ntypes it's expressed in?And we actually\nhave built a toolat CZI called CELLxGENE, where\nyou can put in the mutationthat you're interested in.And it gives you a heat\nmap of cross cell typesof which cell types are\nexpressing the gene that you'reinterested in.And so then you can\nstart looking at, OK,if I look at gene X and I know\nit's related to heart disease--but if you look at\nthe heat map, it'salso spiking in the pancreas.That allows you to\ngenerate a hypothesis.Why?And what happens when\nthis gene is mutatedand the function\nof your pancreas?Really exciting way to look\nand ask questions differently.And you can also\nimagine a world whereif you're trying to develop a\ntherapy, a drug, and the goalis to treat the\nfunction in the heart,but you know that\nit's also reallyactive in the pancreas again.So is there going to be\nan unexpected side effectthat you should think\nabout as you're bringingthis drug to clinical trials?So it's an incredibly\nexciting tooland one that's only\ngoing to get betteras we get more and\nmore sophisticatedways to analyze the data.ANDREW HUBERMAN:\nI must say, I lovethat because if I look at\nthe advances in neuroscienceover the last 15\nyears, most of themdidn't necessarily come from\nlooking at the nervous system.They came from the understanding\nthat the immune systemimpacts the brain.Everyone prior to that\ntalked about the brainas an immune-privileged organ.What you just said\nalso bridges the dividebetween single cells,\norgans and systems, right?Because ultimately,\ncells make up organs.Organs make up systems.And they're all\ntalking to one another.And everyone nowadays is\nfamiliar with gut-brain axisor the microbiome\nbeing so important.But rarely is the discussion\nbetween organs discussed,so to speak.So I think it's wonderful.So that tool was\ngenerated by CZI.Or CCI funded that tool?MARK ZUCKERBERG: We built that.PRISCILLA CHAN: We built it.ANDREW HUBERMAN: You built it.So is it built by Meta?Is this Meta?MARK ZUCKERBERG: No, no,\nit has its own engineers.ANDREW HUBERMAN: Got it.MARK ZUCKERBERG: Yeah.They're completely\ndifferent organizations.ANDREW HUBERMAN: Incredible.And so a graduate\nstudent or postdocwho's interested in\na particular mutationcould put this mutation\ninto this database.That graduate student\nor postdoc mightbe in a laboratory known\nfor working on heart,but suddenly find that\nthey're collaboratingwith other scientists that work\non the pancreas, which alsois wonderful because\nit bridges the dividebetween these fields.Fields are so\nsiloed in science--not just different\nbuildings, but peoplerarely talk, unless things\nlike this are happening.PRISCILLA CHAN: I mean, the\ngraduate student is someonethat we want to empower\nbecause, one, they'rethe future of\nscience, as you know.And within CELLxGENE,\nif you put in the geneyou're interested in and\nit shows you the heat map,we also will pull up the most\nrelevant papers to that gene.And so read these things.ANDREW HUBERMAN:\nThat's fantastic.As we all know,\nquality nutrition"

is one\nof the largest non-profit lifesciences AI clusters.It's on the order of 1,000 GPUs.And it's larger than what\nmost people have accessto in academia that you can do\nserious engineering work on.And by basically\ntraining a modelwith all of the\nHuman Cell Atlas Dataand a bunch of other\ninputs as well,we think you'll be able\nto basically imagineall of the different\ntypes of cells and allthe different states that they\ncan be in, and when they'rehealthy and diseased,\nand how they'llinteract with different--interact with each\nother, interactwith different potential drugs.But I think the state\nof LLMs, I thinkthis is where it's\nhelpful to understand--have a good understanding\nand be groundedin the modern state of AI.I mean, these things\nare not foolproof.I mean, one of the\nflaws of modern LLMsis they hallucinate.So the question is,\nhow do you make itso that that can be an advantage\nrather than a disadvantage?And I think the way that it\nends up being an advantageis when they help you\nimagine a bunch of statesthat someone could be in, but\nthen you, as the scientistor engineer, go and validate\nthat those are true,whether they're solutions\nto how a protein canbe folded or possible\nstates that a cell couldbe in when it's interacting\nwith other things.But we're not yet\nat the state with AIthat you can just take the\noutputs of these thingsas gospel and run from there.But they are very good,\nI think as you said,hypothesis generators or\npossible solution generatorsthat then you can go validate.So I think that that's\na very powerful thingthat we can basically--building on the first\nfive years of science workaround the Human Cell Atlas\nand all the data that'sbeen built out-- carry\nthat forward into somethingthat I think is going to be a\nvery novel tool going forward.And that's the type\nof thing that Ithink we're set up to do well.I mean, you had this exchange a\nlittle while back about fundinglevels and how CZI is just a\ndrop in the bucket comparedto NIH.The thing that I think we\ncan do that's differentis funding some of these\nlonger term, bigger projects.It is hard to galvanize\nthe and pull togetherthe energy to do that.And it's a lot of what most\nscience funding is, relativelysmall projects\nthat are exploringthings over relatively\nshort time horizons.And one of the things\nthat we try to dois build these tools over\n5, 10, 15-year periods.They're often\nprojects that requirehundreds of millions\nof dollars of fundingand world-class engineering\nteams and infrastructure to do.And that, I think, is a pretty\ncool contribution to the fieldthat I think is--there aren't as\nmany other folks whoare doing that kind of thing.But that's one of\nthe reasons whyI'm personally excited\nabout the virtual cell stuffbecause it just this perfect\nintersection of all thestuff that we've\ndone in single cell,the previous collaborations\nthat we've done with the fieldand bringing together\nthe industry and AIexpertise around this.ANDREW HUBERMAN:\nYeah, I completelyagree that the model of science\nthat you're putting togetherwith CZI isn't just\nunique from NIH,but it's extremely\nimportant thatthe independent\ninvestigator model is what'sdriven the progression of\nScience in this countryand, to some extent, in Northern\nEurope for the last 100 years.And it's wonderful,\non the one hand,because it allows for that\nimage we have of a scientisttinkering away or the people\nin their lab, and thenthe eurekas.And that hopefully translates\nto better human health.But I think, in my opinion,\nwe've moved past that modelas the most effective model\nor the only model thatshould be explored.MARK ZUCKERBERG: Yeah, I\njust think it's a balance.You want that.But you want to\nempower those people.I think that that's these\ntools empower those folks.ANDREW HUBERMAN: Sure.And there are mechanisms\nto do that, like NIH.But it's hard to do\ncollaborative science.It's interesting that we're\nsitting here not far--because I grew up right\nnear here as well.I'm not far from the garage\nmodel of tech, right?The Hewlett-Packard model,\nnot far from here at all.And the idea was the tinkerer\nin the garage, the inventor.And then people often\nforget that to implementall the technologies\nthey discoveredtook enormous factories\nand warehouses.So there's a similarity there\nto Facebook, Meta, et cetera.But I think, in\nscience, we imaginethat the scientists\nalone in their laboratoryand those eureka moments.But I think, nowadays, the\nbig questions really requireextensive collaboration and\ncertainly tool development.And one of the tools that\nyou keep coming back tois these LLMs, these\nlarge language models."

            "text": "And maybe you could\njust elaborate,for those that aren't familiar.What is a large language model?For the uninformed, what is it?And what does it allow us to\ndo that different, other typesof AI don't allow?Or more importantly,\nperhaps whatdoes it allow us to do that a\nbunch of really smart people,highly informed in a\ngiven area of science,staring at the data--what can it do\nthat they can't do?MARK ZUCKERBERG: Sure.So I think a lot of the\nprogression of machine learninghas been about building systems,\nneural networks or otherwise,that can basically make sense\nand find patterns in largerand larger amounts of data.And there was a breakthrough\na number of yearsback that some folks\nat Google actually madecalled this transformer\nmodel architecture.And it was this\nhuge breakthroughbecause before then there\nwas somewhat of a capwhere if you fed more\ndata into a Neural Networkpast some point,\nit didn't reallyglean more insights from\nit, whereas transformersjust-- we haven't seen\nthe end of how big thatcan scale to yet.I mean, I think that\nthere's a chancethat we run into some ceiling.ANDREW HUBERMAN: So\nit never asymptotes?MARK ZUCKERBERG: We\nhaven't observed it yet.But we just haven't built\nbig enough systems yet.So I would guess that--I don't know.I think that this\nis actually oneof the big questions\nin the AI field today,is basically, are transformers\nand are the current modelarchitectures sufficient?If you just build larger\nand larger clusters,do you eventually\nget something that'slike human intelligence\nor super intelligence?Or is there some kind\nof fundamental limitto this architecture that\nwe just haven't reached yet?And once we get a little bit\nfurther in building them out,then we'll reach that.And then we'll need\na few more leapsbefore we get to the\nlevel of AI that Ithink will unlock\na ton of reallyfuturistic and amazing things.But there's no doubt\nthat even just beingable to process\nthe amount of datathat we can now with\nthis model architecturehas unlocked a lot\nof new use cases.And the reason why they're\ncalled large language models isbecause one of the first uses\nof them is people basicallyfeed in all of the language\nfrom, basically, the worldwide web.And you can think about them as\nbasically prediction machines.You put in a prompt.And it can basically\npredict a versionof what should come next.So you type in a headline\nfor a news story.And it can predict what it\nthinks the story should be.Or you could train\nit so that it couldbe a chat, bot\nwhere, OK, if you'reprompted with this question,\nyou, can get this response.But one of the\ninteresting thingsis it turns out that there's\nactually nothing specificto using human language in it.So if instead of feeding\nit human language, if youuse that model architecture\nfor a network and insteadyou feed it all of the\nHuman Cell Atlas Data,then if you prompt it\nwith a state of a cell,it can spit out\ndifferent versionsof how that cell can\ninteract or different statesthat the cell could be\nin next when it interactswith different things.ANDREW HUBERMAN: Does it have\nto take a genetics class?So for instance, if you give\nit a bunch of genetics data,do you have to say, hey,\nby the way, and thenyou give it a genetics class so\nit understands that you've gotDNA, RNA, mRNA, and proteins?MARK ZUCKERBERG: No, I think\nthat the basic nature of allthese machine learning\ntechniques is they'rebasically pattern\nrecognition systems.So there are these very\ndeep statistical machinesthat are very efficient\nat finding patterns.So it's not actually--you don't need to teach\na language model that'strying to speak a language\na lot of specific thingsabout that language either.You just feed it in\na bunch of examples.And then let's say you teach\nit about something in English,but then you also give\nit a bunch of examplesof people speaking Italian.It'll actually be able to\nexplain the thing that itlearned in English in Italian.So the crossover and just\nthe pattern recognitionis the thing that is pretty\nprofound and powerfulabout this.But it really does apply to\na lot of different things.Another example in the\nscientific communityhas been the work\nthat AlphaFold,basically the folks at DeepMind,\nhave done on protein folding.It's just basically a lot of\nthe same model architecture.But instead of\nlanguage, there theyfold they fed in all\nof these protein data.And you can give it a state.And it can spit out solutions to\nhow those proteins get folded.So it's very powerful.I don't think we know\nyet, as an industry, whatthe natural limits of it are.I think that that's one\nof the things that'spretty exciting about\nthe current state.But it's certainly allows\nyou to solve problemsthat just weren't solved with\nthe generation of machinelearning that came before it.ANDREW HUBERMAN:\nIt sounds like CZIis moving a lot of work that was\njust done in vitro, in dishes,and in vivo, in\nliving organisms,model organisms are humans,\nto in silico, as we say.So do you foresee a future where\na lot of biomedical research,certainly the work of CZI\nincluded, is done by machines?I mean, obviously,\nit's much lower cost.And you can run millions\nof experiments, which,of course, is not to\nsay that humans are notgoing to be involved.But I love the idea that we\ncan run experiments in silicoen masse.PRISCILLA CHAN: I think\nin silico experiments aregoing to be incredibly helpful\nto test things quickly,cheaply and just unleash\na lot of creativity.I do think you need to be\nvery careful about makingsure it still translates\nand matches the humans.One thing that's\nfunny in basic scienceis we've basically cured\nevery single disease in mice.We know what's going on when\nthey have a number of diseasesbecause they're used\nas a model organism.But they are not humans.And a lot of times,\nthat researchis relevant, but not\ndirectly one-to-onetranslatable to humans.So you just have to be really\ncareful about making surethat it actually\nworks for humans.ANDREW HUBERMAN: Sounds\nlike what CZI is doingis actually creating\na new field.As I'm hearing all of\nthis, I'm thinking, OK,this transcends immunology\ndepartment, cardiothoracicsurgery, I mean neuroscience.I mean, the idea of a new field,\nwhere you certainly embracethe realities of\nuniversities and laboratoriesbecause that's where most of\nthe work that you're fundingis done.Is that right?MARK ZUCKERBERG: Mm-hmm."

            "text": "ANDREW HUBERMAN:\nSo maybe we needto think about what it means\nto do science differently.And I think that's one of the\nthings that's most exciting.Along those lines, it seems\nthat bringing togethera lot of different\ntypes of peopleat different major\ninstitutions is goingto be especially important.So I know that the initial\nCZI Biohub, gratefully,included Stanford.We'll put that\nfirst in the list,but also UCSF, forgive me.I have many friends at\nUCSF and also Berkeley.But there are now some\nadditional institutionsinvolved.So maybe you could\ntalk about that,and what motivated the decision\nto branch outside the Bay Areaand why you selected those\nparticular additionalinstitutions to be included.MARK ZUCKERBERG: Well,\nI'll just say it.A big part of why we wanted\nto create additional biohubsis we were just so\nimpressed by the workthat the folks who were\nrunning the first biohub did.PRISCILLA CHAN: Yeah.And you should walk\nthrough the workof the Chicago Biohub\nand the New York Biohubthat we just announced.But I think it's actually an\ninteresting set of examplesthat balance the\nlimits of what you wantto do with physical\nmaterial engineeringand where things are\npurely biologicalbecause the Chicago team\nis really building moresensors to be able to understand\nwhat's going on in your body.But that's more of a physical\nkind of engineering challenge,whereas the New York\nteam-- we basicallytalk about this as like a\ncellular endoscope of beingable to have an immune\ncell or something thatcan go and understand,\nwhat's the thing that'sgoing on in your body?But it's not a physical\npiece of hardware.It's a cell that you can\nbasically have just go reportout on different things that\nare happening inside the body.ANDREW HUBERMAN: Oh, so making\nthe cell the the microscope.PRISCILLA CHAN: Totally.MARK ZUCKERBERG: And\nthen eventually actuallybeing able to act on it.But I mean, you should go\ninto more detail on all this.PRISCILLA CHAN: So\na core principleof how we think about biohubs\nis that it has to be--when we invited\nproposals, it hasto be at least\nthree institutions,so really breaking down the\nbarrier of a single university,oftentimes asking for the\npeople designing the researchaim to come from all different\nbackgrounds and to explain whythat the problem that\nthey want to solverequires interdisciplinary,\ninter-university, institutioncollaboration to\nactually make happen.We just put that\nrequest for proposalout there with our\nSan Francisco Biohubas an example,\nwhere they've doneincredible work in single cell\nbiology and infectious disease.And we got--I want to say--\nlike 57 proposalsfrom over 150 institutions.A lot of ideas came together.And we were so, so\nexcited that we'vebeen able to launch\nChicago and New York.Chicago is a collaboration\nbetween UIUC,University of Illinois\nUrbana-Champaign,and University of\nChicago and Northwestern.Obviously, these universities\nare multifaceted.But if I were to describe\nthem by their stereotypicalstrength, Northwestern has\nan incredible medical systemand hospital system.University of Chicago\nbrings to the tableincredible basic\nscience strengths.University of Illinois is\na computing powerhouse.And so they came\ntogether and proposedthat they were going\nto start thinkingabout cells in tissue,\nso one of the layersthat you just alluded to.So how do the cells that we know\nbehave and act differently whenthey come together as a tissue?And one of the first tissues\nthat they're starting withis skin.So they've already been\nable to, as a collaborationunder the leadership, of\nShana Kelly design engineeredskin tissue.The architecture looks the\nsame as what's in you and I.And what they've done is\nbuilt these super, super thinsensors.And they embed these sensors\nthroughout the layersof this engineered tissue.And they read out the data.They want to see what\nthese cells are secreting,how these cells\ntalk to each otherand what happens when\nthese cells get inflamed.Inflammation is an\nincredibly important processthat drives 50% of all deaths.And so this is another\ndisease-agnostic approach.We want to understand\ninflammation.And they're going to\nget a ton of informationout from these sensors that tell\nyou what happens when somethinggoes awry because\nright now we can say,when you have an\nallergic reaction,your skin gets red and puffy.But what is the\nearliest signal of that?And these sensors can\nlook at the behaviorsof these cells over time.And then you can apply\na large language modelto look at the earliest\nstatistically significantchanges that can allow you to\nintervene as early as possible.So that's what Chicago's doing.They're starting\nin the skin cells.They're also looking at the\nneuromuscular junction, whichis the connection between where\na neuron attaches to a muscleand tells the muscle\nhow to behave--super important in things\nlike ALS, but also in aging.The slowed transmission\nof informationacross that\nneuromuscular junctionis what causes old\npeople to fall.Their brain cannot trigger their\nmuscles to react fast enough.And so we want to\nbe able to embedthese sensors to understand how\nthese different, interconnectedsystems within our\nbodies work together.In New York, they're doing a\nrelated, but equally excitingproject where they're\nengineering individual cellsto be able to go in and identify\nchanges in a human body.So what they'll do is--they're calling it--ANDREW HUBERMAN: It's wild.I mean, I love that.I mean, this is--I don't want to go on a tangent.But for those that want to\nlook it up adaptive optics,there's a lot of\ndistortion and interferencewhen you try and look\nat something reallysmall or really far away.And really smart\nphysicists figured out,well, use the interference\nas part of the microscope.Make those actually\nlenses of the microscope.MARK ZUCKERBERG: We\nshould talk about imagingseparately after you talk\nabout the New York Biohub.ANDREW HUBERMAN: It's extremely\nclever, along those lines.It's not intuitive.But then when you hear it, it's\nlike it makes so much sense.It's not immediately intuitive.Make the cells that already\ncan navigate to tissuesor embed themselves in\ntissues be the microscopewithin that tissue.I love it.PRISCILLA CHAN: Totally.The way that I explain\nthis to my friendsand my family is this\nis Fantastic Voyage,but real life.We are going into\nthe human body.And we're using the immune\ncells, which are privilegedand already working to\nkeep your body healthy,and being able to target them\nto examine certain things.So you can engineer an immune\ncell to go in your bodyand look inside your\ncoronary arteries and say,are these arteries healthy?Or are there plaques?Because plaques\nlead to blockage,which lead to heart attacks.And the cell can then\nrecord that informationand report it back out.That's the first half\nof what the New YorkBiohub is going to do.ANDREW HUBERMAN: Fantastic.PRISCILLA CHAN: The\nsecond half is can youthen engineer the cells to\ngo do something about it.Can I then tell\na different cell,immune cell that is able\nto transport in your bodyto go in and clean that\nup in a targeted way?And so it's incredibly exciting.They're going to\nstudy things thatare immune privilege, that\nyour immune system normallydoesn't have access to--things like ovarian\nand pancreatic cancer.They'll also look at a number\nof neurodegenerative diseases,since the immune system doesn't\npresently have a ton of accessinto the nervous system.But it's both mind blowing\nand it feels like sci-fi.But science is\nactually in a placewhere if you really push\na group of incrediblyqualified scientists\nsay, could you do thisif given the chance, the\nanswer is like probably.Give us enough time, the\nbright team and resources.It's doable.MARK ZUCKERBERG: Yeah.I mean, it's a 10\nto 15-year project.But it's awesome,\nengineered cells, yeah.ANDREW HUBERMAN: I\nlove the optimism.And the moment you said make\nthe cell the microscope,so to speak, I was\nlike yes, yes and yes.It just makes so much sense.What motivated the decision\nto do the work of CZI"

people\nfrom all backgroundsand saying, hey, have at it and\ndoing this stuff from scratch?I mean, it's a very\ninteresting decisionto do this in the\ncontext of an existingframework of graduate students\nthat need to do their thesisand get a first author\npaper because there'sa whole set of structures\nwithin academiathat I think both\nfacilitate, but also limitthe progression of science.That independent\ninvestigator modelthat we talked about\na little bit earlier,it's so core to the way\nscience has been done.This is very different\nand frankly soundsfar more efficient, if I'm\nto be completely honest.And we'll see if I renew my\nNIH funding after saying that.But I think we all\nwant the same thing.As scientists and\nas humans, we wantto understand the way we work.And we want healthy people\nto persist to be healthy.And we want sick\npeople to get healthy.I mean, that's really\nultimately the goal.It's not super complicated.It's just hard to do.PRISCILLA CHAN: So the\nteams at the biohubare actually independent\nof the universities.ANDREW HUBERMAN: Got it.PRISCILLA CHAN: So each\nbiohub will probablyhave in total maybe 50 people\nworking on deep efforts.However, it's an acknowledgment\nthat not all of the bestscientists who can\ncontribute to this areaare actually going to, one,\nwant to leave a universityor want to take on the\nfull-time scope of this project.So it's the ability to\npartner with universitiesand to have the faculty\nat all the universitiesbe able to contribute\nto the overall project,is how the biohub is structured.ANDREW HUBERMAN: Got it.MARK ZUCKERBERG: But a lot of\nthe way that we're approachingCZI is this long-term,\niterative projectto figure out-- try a\nbunch of different things,figure out which things produce\nthe most interesting results,and then double down on those\nin the next five-year push.So we just went\nthrough this periodwhere we wrapped\nup the first fiveyears of the science program.And we tried a lot\nof different models,all kinds of different things.And it's not that\nthe biohub model--we don't think it's\nthe best or only model.But we found that it was\na really interesting wayto unlock a bunch\nof collaborationand bring some\ntechnical resources thatallow for this longer\nterm development.And it's not something that\nis widely being pursuedacross the rest of the field.So we figured, OK, this\nis an interesting thingthat we can help push on.But I mean, yeah, we do\nbelieve in the collaboration.But I also think that\nwe come at this with--we don't think that the way\nthat we're pursuing thisis the only way to\ndo this or the waythat everyone should do it.We're pretty aware of what\nis the rest of the ecosystemand how we can play\na unique role in it.ANDREW HUBERMAN: It\nfeels very synergisticwith the way science\nis already doneand also fills an incredibly\nimportant niche that,frankly, wasn't filled before.Along the lines of\nimplementation--so let's say your large language\nmodels combined with imagingtools reveal that a\nparticular set of genes actingin a cluster--I don't know-- set\nup an organ crash.Let's say the pancreas\ncrashes at a particular stageof pancreatic cancer.I mean, it's still one of the\nmost deadliest of the cancers.And there are others that you\ncertainly wouldn't want to get.But that's among the ones you\nwouldn't want to get the most.So you discover that.And then and the\nidea is that, OK,then AI reveals\nsome potential drugtargets that then bear\nout in vitro, in a dishand in a mouse model.How is the actual implementation\nto drug discovery?Or maybe this target is\ndruggable, maybe it's not.Maybe it requires\nsome other approach--laser ablation\napproach or something.We don't know.But ultimately,\nis CZI going to beinvolved in the implementation\nof new therapeutics?Is that the idea?MARK ZUCKERBERG: Less so.PRISCILLA CHAN: Less so.This is where it's important\nto work in an ecosystemand to know your\nown limitations.There are groups, and\nstartups and companiesthat take that and bring it to\ntranslation very effectively.I would say the\nplace where we havea small window into\nthat world is actuallyour work with rare\ndisease groups.We have, through our\nRare As One portfolio,funded patient advocates\nto create rare diseaseorganizations where patients\ncome together and actually pooltheir collective experience.They build\nbioregistries, registriesof their natural history.And they both partner\nwith researchersto do the research\nabout their diseaseand with drug developers to\nincentivize drug developersto focus on what they may\nneed for their disease.And one thing that's\nimportant to point outis that rare\ndiseases aren't rare.There are over\n7,000 rare diseasesand collectively impact\nmany, many individuals.And I think the thing\nthat's, from a basic scienceperspective, the incredibly\nfascinating thingabout rare diseases is that\nthey're actually windows to howthe body normally should work.And so there are often\nmutations that whengenes that when they're mutated\ncause very specific diseases,but that tell you how the\nnormal biology works as well.ANDREW HUBERMAN: Got it.So you discussed basically the\nmajor goals and initiativesof the CZI for the next,\nsay, 5 to 10 years.And then beyond\nthat, the targetswill be explored by\nbiotech companies.They'll grab those targets, and\ntest them and implement them.MARK ZUCKERBERG:\nThere's also, I think,been a couple of teams from\nthe initial biohub thatwere interested in spinning\nout ideas into startups.So even though it's\nnot a thing that we'regoing to pursue because\nwe're a philanthropy,we want to enable\nthe work that getsdone to be able to get turned\ninto companies and thingsthat other people\ngo take and runtowards building\nultimately therapeutics.So that's another zone.But that's not a thing\nthat we're going to do.ANDREW HUBERMAN: Got it.I gather you're both optimists."

not a loaded question.MARK ZUCKERBERG: I don't know.Huh.I mean, I think I'm more\nprobably technologicallyoptimistic about\nwhat can be built.And I think you, because of\nyour focus as an actual

partners,our relative optimism\ncomes throughas Mark just is overly\noptimistic about his timemanagement and will get\nengrossed in interesting ideas.MARK ZUCKERBERG: I'm late.PRISCILLA CHAN: And he's late.ANDREW HUBERMAN: Physicians\nare very punctual, yeah.PRISCILLA CHAN: And\nbecause he's late,I have to channel Mark\nis an optimist wheneverI'm waiting for him.MARK ZUCKERBERG: That's\nsuch a nice

different aspects of life.ANDREW HUBERMAN: Who said that?Did you say that,\nMark Zuckerberg?MARK ZUCKERBERG: No, I did not.PRISCILLA CHAN: Absolutely not.MARK ZUCKERBERG: No, no, no.I like it.I did not invent it.ANDREW HUBERMAN:\nWe'll give it to you.We'll put it out there.MARK ZUCKERBERG: No, no, no.ANDREW HUBERMAN: Just\nkidding, just kidding.MARK ZUCKERBERG: But I do\nthink that there's reallysomething to it, right?I mean, if you're\ndiscussing any idea,there's all these reasons\nwhy it might not work.And those reasons\nare probably true.The people who are stating them\nprobably have some validityto it.But the question is, is that\nthe most productive way to viewthe world?Across the board,\nI think the peoplewho tend to be the\nmost productiveand get the most done--you kind of need\nto be optimisticbecause if you don't believe\nthat something can get done,then why would\nyou go work on it?ANDREW HUBERMAN:\nThe reason I askthe question is that these days\nwe hear a lot about the futureis looking so dark in\nthese various ways.And you have children.So you have families.And you are a family, excuse me.And you also have\nfamilies independentlythat are now merged.But I love the\noptimism behind the CZIbecause, behind\nall this, there'sa set of big\nstatements on the wall.One, the future can be\nbetter than the present,in terms of treating disease,\nmaybe even, you said,eliminating diseases,\nall diseases.I love that optimism.And there's a tractable\npath to do it.We're going to put literally\nmoney, and time, and energy,and people, and technology\nand AI behind that.And so I have to ask,\nwas having childrena significant modifier in terms\nof your view of the future?Like wow, you hear all\nthis doom and gloom.What's the future going\nto be like for them?Did you sit back and\nthink, what would itlook like if there was a\nfuture with no diseases?Is that the future, we\nwant our children in?I mean, I'm voting a big yes.So we're not we're not\ngoing to debate that at all.But was having\nchildren an inspirationfor the CZI in some way?MARK ZUCKERBERG: Yeah.SoPRISCILLA CHAN: I think\nmy answer to that--I would dial backwards for me.And I'll just tell a very\nbrief story about my family.I'm the daughter of\nChinese-Vietnamese refugees.My parents and grandparents\nwere boat people,if you remember\npeople left Vietnamduring the war in these small\nboats into the South China Sea.And there were stories about\nhow these boats would sinkwith whole families on them.And so my\ngrandparents, both setsof grandparents who\nknew each other,decided that there was a\nbetter future out there.And they were willing\nto take risks for it.But they were afraid of\nlosing all of their kids.My dad is one of six.My mom is one of 10.And so they decided\nthat there was somethingout there in this bleak time.And they paired up their\nkids, one from each family,and sent them out on\nthese little boatsbefore the internet, before\ncell phones, and just said,we'll see you on the other side.ANDREW HUBERMAN: Wow.PRISCILLA CHAN:\nAnd the kids werebetween the ages of like\n10 to 25, so young kids.My mom was a teenager, early\nteen when this happened.And everyone made it.And I get to sit\nhere and talk to you.So how could I not believe\nthat better is possible?And like I hope that that's\nin my epigenetics somewhereand that I carry on.ANDREW HUBERMAN: That\nis a spectacular story.PRISCILLA CHAN: Isn't that wild?ANDREW HUBERMAN:\nIt is spectacular.PRISCILLA CHAN: How can I\nbe a pessimist with that?ANDREW HUBERMAN: I love it.And I so appreciate that\nyou became a physicianbecause you're now\nbringing that optimism,and that epigenetic\nunderstanding,and cognitive understanding\nand emotional understandingto the field of medicine.So I'm grateful to the people\nthat made that decision.PRISCILLA CHAN: Yeah.I've always known that story.But you don't understand\nhow wild that feelsuntil you have your own child.And you're like,\nwell, I can't even--I refuse to let her use glass\nbottles only or somethinglike that.And you're like, oh my God,\nthe risk and the willingnessof my grandparents to believe\nin something bigger and betteris just astounding.And our own children give\nit a sense of urgency.ANDREW HUBERMAN: Again,\na spectacular story.And you're sending knowledge\nout into the fields of scienceand bringing knowledge\ninto the fields of science.And I love this.We'll see you on the other side.I'm confident that it\nwill all come back.Well, thank you\nso much for that.Mark, you have the\nopportunity to talk about--did having kids\nchange your worldview?MARK ZUCKERBERG: It's really\ntough to beat that story.ANDREW HUBERMAN: It is\ntough to beat that story.And they are also your children.So in this case, you get two for\nthe price of one, so to speak.MARK ZUCKERBERG: Having\nchildren definitely changesyour time horizon.So I think that\nthat's one thing.There are all these things that\nI think we had talked about,for as long as we've known\neach other, that you eventuallywant to go do.But then it's like,\noh, we're having kids.We need to get on this, right?So I think that there's--PRISCILLA CHAN:\nThat was actuallyone of the checklists, the baby\nchecklist before the first.MARK ZUCKERBERG: It was\nlike, the baby's coming.We have to start CZI.PRISCILLA CHAN: Truly.MARK ZUCKERBERG: I'm like\nsitting in the hospitaldelivery room finishing\nediting the letter that wewere going to publish\nto announce the work.PRISCILLA CHAN: Some people\nthink that is an exaggeration.It was not.We really were editing\nthe final draft.ANDREW HUBERMAN:\nBirthed CZI before youbirthed the human child.Well, it's an\nincredible Initiative.I've been following it\nsince its inception.And it's already been\ntremendously successful.And everyone in the\nfield of science--and I have a lot of\ncommunication with thosefolks--feels the same way.And the future is even\nbrighter for it, it's clear.And thank you for expanding\nto the Midwest and New York.And we're all very excited to\nsee where all of this goes.I share in your optimism.And thank you for\nyour time today.PRISCILLA CHAN: Yeah, thank you.MARK ZUCKERBERG: Thank you.A lot more to do.ANDREW HUBERMAN: I'd like\nto take a quick break"

            "text": "you're extremely\nwell-known for your rolein technology development.But by virtue of your\npersonal interestsand also where Meta\ntechnology interfaceswith mental health\nand physical health,you're starting to become\nsynonymous with health,whether you realize it or not.Part of that is because\nthere's posts, footageof you rolling jiu jitsu.You won a jiu jitsu\ncompetition recently.You're doing other forms of\nmartial arts, water sports,including surfing,\nand on and on.So you're doing it yourself.But maybe we could just\nstart off with technologyand get this issue out\nof the way first, whichis that I think many people\nassume that technology,especially technology that\ninvolves a screen, excuseme, of any kind is going to\nbe detrimental to our health.But that doesn't necessarily\nhave to be the case.So could you explain\nhow you see technologymeshing with, inhibiting,\nor maybe even promotingphysical and mental health?MARK ZUCKERBERG: Sure.I mean, I think this is\na really important topic.The research that we've\ndone suggests that it's notall good or all bad.I think how you're\nusing the technology hasa big impact on\nwhether it is basicallya positive experience for you.And even within technology,\neven within social media,there's not one type of\nthing that people do.I think, at its best, you're\nforming meaningful connectionswith other people.And there's a lot of research\nthat basically suggeststhat it's the\nrelationships that we haveand the friendships that bring\nthe most happiness in our livesand, at some level,\nend up even correlatingwith living a longer\nand healthier lifebecause that grounding\nthat you have in communityends up being\nimportant for that.So I think that aspect\nof social media,which is the ability to connect\nwith people, to understandwhat's going on\nin people's lives,have empathy for them,\ncommunicate what'sgoing on with your life,\nexpress that, that'sgenerally positive.There are ways that\nit can be negative,in terms of bad interactions,\nthings like bullying,which we can talk about because\nthere's a lot that we'vedone to basically make sure that\npeople can be safe from thatand give people tools and\ngive kids the ability to havethe right parental controls.Their parents can oversee that.But that's the interacting\nwith people side.There's another\nside of all of this,which I think of as just\npassive consumption, which,at its best, is entertainment.And entertainment is an\nimportant human thing, too.But I don't think that that\nhas quite the same associationwith the long-term well-being\nand health benefitsas being able to help people\nconnect with other people does.And I think, at its worst, some\nof the stuff we see online--I think, these days,\na lot of the newsis just so relentlessly\nnegative that it's justhard to come away\nfrom an experiencewhere looking at the\nnews for half an hourand feel better about the world.So I think that\nthere's a mix on this.I think the more\nthat social mediais about connecting\nwith people and the morethat when you're consuming\nand using the mediapart of social media to\nlearn about things thatenrich you and can provide\ninspiration or education asopposed to things that\njust leave you with a moretoxic feeling, that's the\nbalance that we try to getright across our products.And I think we're pretty\naligned with the communitybecause, at the end of\nthe day, I mean, peopledon't want to use a product\nand come away feeling bad.There's a lot that\npeople talk about--evaluate a lot of\nthese products in termsof information and utility.But I think it's\nas important, whenyou're designing a\nproduct, to thinkabout what kind of\nfeeling you're creatingwith the people who\nuse it, whether that'san aesthetic sense when\nyou're designing hardware,or just what do you\nmake people feel.And generally, people don't\nwant to feel bad, right?That doesn't mean that\nwe want to shelter peoplefrom bad things that are\nhappening in the world.But I don't really think that--it's not what people\nwant for us to justbe just showing all this super\nnegative stuff all day long.So we work hard on all these\ndifferent problems-- makingsure that we're helping connect\npeople as best as possible,helping make sure that\nwe give people good toolsto block people who\nmight be bullying them,or harass them, or\nespecially for younger folks,anyone under the age of 16\ndefaults into an experiencewhere their\nexperience is private.We have all these\nparental tools.So that way, parents can\nunderstand what their childrenare up to in a good balance.And then on the\nother side, we tryto give people tools\nto understand howthey're spending their time.We try to give people tools\nso that if you're a teenand you're stuck in some\nloop of just lookingat one type of content,\nwe'll nudge you and say, hey,you've been looking at content\nof this type for a while.How about something else?And here's a bunch\nof other examples.So I think that there\nare things that youcan do to push this in\na positive direction.But I think it just\nstarts with havinga more nuanced view of this\nisn't all good or all bad.And the more that you\ncan make it a positivething, the better this\nwill be for all the peoplewho use our products.ANDREW HUBERMAN: That\nmakes really good sense."

            "text": "In terms of the negative\nexperience, I agree.I don't think anyone wants\na negative experiencein the moment.I think where some people\nget concerned perhaps--and I think about my own\ninteractions with, say,Instagram, which I use all the\ntime for getting informationout, but also\nconsuming information.And I happen to love it.It's where I\nessentially launchedthe non-podcast segment of\nmy podcast and continue to.I can think of experiences\nthat are a little bitlike highly\nprocessed food, whereit tastes good at the time.It's highly engrossing.But it it's not\nnecessarily nutritious.And you don't feel\nvery good afterwards.So for me, that would\nbe the little collageof default options to\nclick on in Instagram.Occasionally, I\nnotice-- and this justreflects my failure, not\nInstagram's, that thereare a lot of street\nfight things,like people beating\npeople up on the street.And I have to say, these have a\nvery strong gravitational pull.I'm not somebody that enjoys\nseeing violence, per se.But you know I find myself--I'll click on one of\nthese, like what happened?And I'll see someone get hit.And there's a little melee\non the street or something.And those seem to be\noffered to me a lot lately.And again, this is\nmy fault. It reflectsmy prior searching experience.But I noticed that it has a bit\nof a gravitational pull, whereI didn't learn anything.It's not teaching me any\nuseful street self-defenseskills of any kind.And at the same time,\nI also really enjoysome of the cute animal stuff.And so I get a\nlot of those also.So there's this\npolarized collagethat's offered to me that\nreflects my prior searchbehavior.You could argue that the\ncute animal stuff is justentertainment.But actually, it fills\nme with a feeling,in some cases, that\ntruly delights me.I delight in animals.And we're not just\ntalking about kittens.I mean, animals I've\nnever seen before,interactions between\nanimals I've never seenbefore that truly delight me.They energize me\nin a positive waythat when I leave Instagram,\nI do think I'm better off.So I'm grateful for the\nalgorithm in that sense.But I guess, the direct question\nis, is the algorithm justreflective of what one\nhas been looking at a lotprior to that moment\nwhere they log on?Or is it also trying to do\nexactly what you described,which is trying to give people\na good-feeling experience thatleads to more good feelings?MARK ZUCKERBERG: Yeah.I mean, I think we try to\ndo this in a long-term way.I think one simple\nexample of thisis we had this issue\na number of years backabout clickbait\nnews, so articlesthat would have basically\na headline that grabbedyour attention,\nthat made you feellike, oh, I need\nto click on this.And then you click on it.And then the article is\nactually about something that'ssomewhat tangential to it.But people clicked on it.So the naive version of this\nstuff, the 10-year-old versionwas like, oh, people seem\nto be clicking on this.Maybe that's good.But it's actually a pretty\nstraightforward exerciseto instrument the system to\nrealize that, hey, peopleclick on this, and\nthen they don't reallyspend a lot of time reading\nthe news after clicking on it.And after they do\nthis a few times,it doesn't really correlate\nwith them saying that they'rehaving a good experience.Some of how we\nmeasure this is justby looking at how\npeople use the services.But I think it's also\nimportant to balancethat by having real people\ncome in and tell us,OK-- we show them, here are\nthe stories that we could haveshowed you, which of these\nare most meaningful to you,or would make it so that you\nhave the best experience,and just mapping the\nalgorithm and whatwe do to that ground truth of\nwhat people say that they want.So I think that, through\na set of things like that,we really have made large\nsteps to minimize thingslike clickbait over time.It's not like gone\nfrom the internet.But I think we've done a\ngood job of minimizing iton our services.Within that though,\nI do think that weneed to be pretty\ncareful about notbeing paternalistic about what\nmakes different people feelgood.So I mean, I don't\nknow that everyonefeels good about cute animals.I mean, I can't\nimagine that peoplewould feel really bad about it.But maybe they don't have as\nprofound of a positive reactionto it as you just expressed.And I don't know.Maybe people who are\nmore into fightingwould look at the\nstreet fighting videos--assuming that they're within\nour community standards.I think that there's\na level of violencethat we just don't want\nto be showing at all.But that's a separate question.But if they are, I\nmean, then it's like--I mean, I'm pretty into MMA.I don't get a lot of\nstreet fighting videos.But if I did, maybe I'd feel\nlike I was learning somethingfrom that.I think at various times\nin the company's history,we've been a little bit too\npaternalistic about saying,this is good content, this\nis bad, you should like this,this is unhealthy for you.And I think that we want to\nlook at the long-term effects.You don't want to get\nstuck in a short termloop of like, OK,\njust because youdid this today doesn't\nmean it's what youaspire for yourself over time.But I think, as long as you\nlook at the long-term of whatpeople both say they want and\nwhat they do, giving peoplea fair amount of latitude to\nlike the things that they like,I just think feels like\nthe right set of valuesto bring to this.Now, of course, that\ndoesn't go for everything.There are things that are truly\noff limits and things that--like bullying, for example, or\nthings that are really incitingviolence, things like that.I mean, we have the\nwhole community standardsaround this.But I think, except\nfor those thingswhich I would hope that\nmost people can agree, OK,bullying is bad--I hope that 100% of\npeople agree with that.And not 100%, maybe 99%.Except for the things that\nkind of get that very--that feel pretty extreme\nand bad like that,I think you want to\ngive people spaceto like what they want to like.ANDREW HUBERMAN: Yesterday, I\nhad the very good experience"

of\nfilter-based tools and justability to customize the\nexperience so that it can standthe best chance of enriching--\nnot just remaining neutral,but enriching their\nmental health status.One thing that came about\nin that conversation,however, was I realized\nthere are all these tools.But do people really know\nthat these tools exist?And I think about my own\nexperience with Instagram.I love watching Adam Mosseri's\nFriday Q&As because he explainsa lot of the tools that\nI didn't know existed.And if people haven't\nseen that, I highlyrecommend they watch that.I think he takes\nquestions on Thursdaysand answers them\nmost every Fridays.So if I'm not aware of the tools\nwithout watching that, thatexists for adults,\nhow does Meta lookat the challenge of making sure\nthat people know that thereare all these tools--I mean, dozens and dozens\nof very useful tools?But I think most of us just\nknow the hashtag, the tag,the click, stories versus feed.We now know that--I also post to Threads.I mean, so we know the\nmajor channels and tools.But this is like\nowning a vehicle thathas incredible features\nthat one doesn'trealize can take you off road,\ncan allow your vehicle to fly.I mean, there's a lot there.So what do you\nthink could be doneto get that information out?Maybe this conversation could\ncue people to [INAUDIBLE]..MARK ZUCKERBERG: I mean, that's\npart of the reason why I wantedto talk to you about this.I mean, I think most of the\nnarrative around social mediais not, OK, all of\nthe different toolsthat people have to\ncontrol their experience.It's the narrative of\nis this just negativefor teens or something.And I think, again,\na lot of thiscomes down to how is the\nexperience being tuned.Are people using it to\nconnect in positive ways?And if so, I think\nit's really positive.So yeah, I mean, I\nthink part of thisis we probably just need to\nget out and talk to people moreabout it.And then there's an\nin-product aspect,which is if you're a\nteen and you sign up,we take you through a pretty\nextensive experience thattries to outline some of this.But that has limits, too,\nbecause when you sign upfor a new thing, if you're\nbombarded with here'sa list of features, you're like,\nOK, I just signed up for this.I don't really understand much\nabout what the service is.Let me go find some\npeople to followwho are my friends on\nhere before I learnabout controls to prevent people\nfrom harassing me or something.That's why I think it's\nreally important to also showa bunch of these\ntools in context.So if you're\nlooking at comments,and if you go to\ndelete a comment,or you go to edit something, try\nto give people prompts in line.It's like, hey, did that\nyou can manage thingsin these ways around that?Or when you're in the inbox\nand you're filtering something,remind people in line.So just because of\nthe number of peoplewho use the products\nand the level of nuancearound each of the controls,\nI think the vast majorityof that education, I think,\nneeds to happen in the product.But I do think that through\nconversations like thisand others that we\nneed to be doing,I think we can create a broader\nawareness that those thingsexist so that way at\nleast people are primedso that way when those things\npop up in the product people,they're like, oh yeah, I knew\nthat there was this control.And here's how I would use that.ANDREW HUBERMAN: I find\nthe restrict functionto be very useful, more than the\nblock function in most cases.I do sometimes have\nto block people.But the restrict\nfunction is really usefulthat you could filter\nspecific comments.You might recognize that\nsomeone has a tendencyto be a little aggressive.And I should point out that\nI actually don't reallymind what people say to me.But I try and maintain\nwhat I call classroom rulesin my comment section, where\nI don't like people attackingother people because I\nwould never tolerate thatin the university classroom.I'm not going to tolerate\nthat in the comments section,for instance.MARK ZUCKERBERG: Yeah.And I think that the example\nthat you just used aboutrestrict versus block gets to\nsomething about product designthat's important, too, which\nis that block is this verypowerful tool that if someone\nis giving you a hard timeand you just want them to\ndisappear from the experience,you can do it.But the design trade-off with\nthat is that in order to makeit so that the person is\njust gone from the experienceand that you don't\nshow up to them,they don't show up to you--inherent to that is\nthat they will havea sense that you blocked them.And that's why I think some\nstuff like restrict or justfiltering, like\nI just don't wantto see as much stuff\nabout this topic--people like using different\ntools for very subtle reasons.I mean, maybe you want the\ncontent to not show up,but you don't want\nthe person who'sposting the content to know that\nyou don't want it to show up.Maybe you don't want to get the\nmessages in your main inbox,but you don't want to tell the\nperson actually that you're notfriends or something like that.You actually need to give\npeople different tools thathave different levels\nof power and nuancearound how the social\ndynamics around using themplay out in order\nto really allowpeople to tailor the experience\nin the ways that they want.ANDREW

say, oh, someone justcame in the door.Hey, how's it going?Hold on, I'm playing\nthis game, justas it was when I was a\nkid playing in Nintendoand someone would walk in.It's fully engrossing.But you'd be like, hold on.And you see they're there.So first of all,\nbravo, incredible.And then the next question\nis, what do we evencall this experience?Because it is\ntruly really mixed.It's a truly mixed\nreality experience.MARK ZUCKERBERG: Yeah.I mean, mixed reality\nis the umbrella termthat refers to the\ncombined experienceof virtual and\naugmented reality.So augmented reality is\nwhat you're eventuallygoing to get with some future\nversion of the smart glasses,where you're primarily\nseeing the world,but you can put holograms in it.So we'll have a\nfuture where you'regoing to walk into a room.And there are going to\nbe as many hologramsas physical objects.If you just think about all the\npaper, the art, physical games,media, your workstation--ANDREW HUBERMAN: If\nwe refer to, let'ssay, an MMA fight, we could just\ndraw it up on the table righthere and just see it repeat\nas opposed to us turningand looking at a screen.MARK ZUCKERBERG: Yeah.I mean, pretty much\nany screen that existscould be a hologram in the\nfuture with smart glasses.There's nothing that\nactually physically needsto be there for that\nwhen you have glassesthat can put a hologram there.And it's an interesting\nthought experimentto just go around and think\nabout, OK, what of the thingsthat are physical in the world\nneed to actually be physical.Your chair does, right?Because you're sitting on it.A hologram isn't\ngoing to support you.But like that art\non the wall, I mean,that doesn't need to\nphysically be there.So I think that that's the\naugmented reality experiencethat we're moving towards.And then we've had these\nheadsets that historically wethink about as VR.And that has been something\nthat is like a fullyimmersive experience.But now, we're getting\nsomething that'sa hybrid in between\nthe two and capableof both, which is a headset\nthat can do both virtual realityand some of these augmented\nreality experiences.And I think that\nthat's really powerful,both because you're going to\nget new applications that allowpeople to collaborate together.And maybe the two of\nus are here physically,but someone joins us and\nit's their avatar there.Or maybe it's some\nversion in the future.You're having a team meeting.And you have some\npeople there physically.And you have some\npeople dialing in.And they're basically like\na hologram, there virtually.But then you also\nhave some AI personasthat are on your\nteam that are helpingyou do different things.And they can be embodied as\navatars and around the tablemeeting with you.ANDREW HUBERMAN:\nAre people are goingto be doing first dates that\nare physically separated?I could imagine that\nsome people would--is it even worth leaving\nthe house type date?And then they find out.And then they meet\nfor the first time.MARK ZUCKERBERG: I mean, maybe.I think dating has physical\naspects to it, too.ANDREW HUBERMAN: Right.Some people might\nnot be-- they wantto know whether\nor not it's worththe effort to head out or not.They want to bridge\nthe divide, right?MARK ZUCKERBERG: It is possible.I mean, I know\nsome of my friendswho are dating basically\nsay that in orderto make sure that they have\na safe experience, if they'regoing on a first\ndate, they'll schedulesomething that's shorter and\nmaybe in the middle of the day.So maybe it's coffee.So that way, if they\ndon't like the person,they can just get out\nbefore going and schedulinga dinner or a real, full date.So I don't know.Maybe in the future,\npeople will havethat experience where\nyou can feel like you'rekind of sitting there.And it's and it's even easier,\nand lighter weight and safer.And if you're not having\na good experience,you can just teleport\nout of there and be gone.But yeah, I think that this\nwill be an interesting questionin the future.There are clearly a lot of\nthings that are only possiblephysically that--or are so much\nbetter physically.And then there are\nall these thingsthat we're building up that\ncan be digital experiences.But it's this weird\nartifact of howthis stuff has been developed\nthat the digital worldand the physical world\nexist in these completelydifferent planes.When you want to interact\nwith the digital world--we do it all the time.But we pull out a small screen.Or we have a big screen.And just basically,\nwe're interactingwith the digital world\nthrough these screens.But I think if we\nfast forward a decadeor more, I think one of the\nreally interesting questionsabout what is the\nworld that we'regoing to live in, I think\nit's going to increasinglybe this mesh of the\nphysical and digital worldsthat will allow us to feel, A,\nthat the world that we're inis just a lot richer\nbecause there can be allthese things that people create\nthat are just so much easierto do digitally than physically.But B, you're going to have a\nreal physical sense of presencewith these things and\nnot feel like interactingin the digital world\nis taking you awayfrom the physical world,\nwhich today is justso much viscerally\nricher and more powerful.I think the digital world\nwill be embedded in thatand will feel just as\nvivid in a lot of ways.So that's why I\nalways think-- whenyou were saying before, you\nfelt like you could lookaround and see the real room.I actually think there's\nan interesting kindof philosophical distinction\nbetween the real roomand the physical room,\nwhich historically Ithink people would have said\nthose are the same thing.But I actually\nthink, in the future,the real room is going\nto be the combinationof the physical world with\nall the digital artifactsand objects that are in there\nthat you can interact with themand feel present, whereas the\nphysical world is just the partthat's physically there.And I think it's possible\nto build a real world that'sthe sum of these two\nthat will actuallybe more profound experience\nthan what we have today.ANDREW HUBERMAN:\nWell, I was

hitting mitts boxing,so hitting targets boxing.MARK ZUCKERBERG:\nYeah, super natural.ANDREW HUBERMAN: Yeah, and it\ncomes at a fairly fast pacethat then picks up.It's got some tutorial.It's very easy to use.And it certainly got\nmy heart rate up.And I'm in at\nleast decent shape.And I have to be\nhonest, I've neveronce desired to do any of\nthese on-screen fitness things.I mean, I can't think of\nanything more aversive than a--I don't want to insult\nany particular products,but riding a stationary\nbike while lookingat a screen pretending\nI'm on a road outside.I can't think of\nanything worse for me.MARK ZUCKERBERG: I do\nlike the leaderboard.Maybe I'm just a very\ncompetitive person.If you're going to be\nrunning on a treadmill,at least give me a\nleaderboard so I can beatthe people who are ahead of me.ANDREW HUBERMAN: I like\nmoving outside and certainlyan exercise class\nor aerobics class,as they used to call them.But the experience I tried\ntoday was extremely engaging.And I've done enough\nboxing to at least knowhow to do a little bit of it.And I really enjoyed it.It gets your heart rate up.And I completely\nforgot that I wasdoing an on-screen experience\nin part because, I believe,I was still in\nthat physical room.And I think there's\nsomething about the meshof the physical room and\nthe virtual experience thatmakes it neither of\none world or the other.I mean, I really felt at\nthe interface of those.And I certainly got\npresence, this feelingof forgetting that I was\nin a virtual experienceand got my heart rate\nup pretty quickly.We had to stop because we\nwere going to start recording.But I would do that for a good\n45 minutes in the morning.And there's no amount of\nmoney you could pay me trulyto look at a screen\nwhile pedaling on a bikeor running on a treadmill.So again, bravo, I think\nit's going to be very useful.It's going to get people\nmoving their bodies more,which certainly--social media, up until now,\nand a lot of technologieshave been accused of limiting\nthe amount of physical activitythat both children and\nadults are engaged in.And we know we need\nphysical activity.You're a big proponent\nof and practitionerof physical activity.So is this a major goal\nof Meta, to get peoplemoving their bodies more\nand getting their heartrates up and so on?MARK ZUCKERBERG: I think\nwe want to enable it.And I think it's good.But I think it comes more from a\nphilosophical view of the worldthan it is necessarily--I mean, I don't go\ninto building productsto try to shape\npeople's behavior.I believe in empowering\npeople to do what they wantand be the best version of\nthemselves that they can be.ANDREW HUBERMAN: So no agenda?MARK ZUCKERBERG: That said,\nI do believe that there'sthe previous\ngeneration of computerswere devices for your mind.And I think that we are\nnot brains and tanks.I think that there's a\nphilosophical view of peopleof like, OK, you are\nprimarily what you think aboutor your values or something.It's like, no, you\nare that and youare a physical manifestation.And people were very physical.And I think building a computer\nfor your whole body and notjust for your mind is very\nfitting with this worldviewthat the actual essence\nof you, if you wantto be present with\nanother person,if you want to be fully engaged\nin experience is not just--it's not just a video conference\ncall that looks at your faceand where you can share ideas.It's something that you\ncan engage your whole body.So, yeah I mean, I\nthink being physicalis very important to me.I mean, that's a lot of the\nmost fun stuff that I get to do.It's a really important\npart of how I personallybalance my energy\nlevels and just geta diversity of experiences\nbecause I could spend allmy time running the company.But I think it's good for people\nto do some different thingsand compete in different areas\nor learn different things.And all of that is good.If people want to do really\nintense workouts with the workthat we're doing with Quest\nor with eventual AR glasses,great.But even if you don't want to\ndo a really intense workout,I think just having a computing\nenvironment and platform whichis inherently physical captures\nmore of the essence of whatwe are as people than any of\nthe previous computing platformsthat we've had to date.ANDREW HUBERMAN: I\nwas even thinking justof the simple task of getting\nbetter range of motion a.k.a.flexibility.I could imagine, inside\nof the VR experience,leaning into a stretch, standard\ntype of lunge-type stretch,but actually seeing a\nmeter of are you are youapproaching new\nlevels of flexibilityin that moment\nwhere it's actuallymeasuring some\nkinesthetic elementson the body in the joints,\nwhereas normally, youmight have to do that in front\nof a camera, which then wouldgive you the data on a screen\nthat you'd look at afterwardsor hire an expensive coach or\nlooking at form and resistancetraining.So you're actually\nlifting physical weights.But it's telling you whether\nor not you're breaking form.I mean, there's just\nso much that couldbe done inside of there.And then my mind\njust starts to spiralinto, wow, this is very\nlikely to transformwhat we think of as,\nquote unquote, \"exercise.\"MARK ZUCKERBERG:\nYeah, I think so.I think there's still\na bunch of questionsthat need to get answered.I don't think most people\nare going to necessarily wantto install a lot of\nsensors or camerasto track their whole body.So we're just over\ntime getting betterfrom the sensors that are on\nthe headsets of being able to dovery good hand tracking.So we have this\nresearch demo whereyou now, just with the hand\ntracking from the headset,you can type.It just projects a little\nkeyboard onto your table.And you can type.And people type like 100\nwords a minute with that.ANDREW HUBERMAN: With\na virtual keyboard?MARK ZUCKERBERG: Yeah.We're starting to be able to--using some modern AI\ntechniques, be able to simulateand understand where\nyour torso's position is.Even though you\ncan't always see it,you can see it a\nbunch of the time.And if you fuse\ntogether what youdo see with the accelerometer\nand understandinghow the thing is\nmoving, you can kind ofunderstand what the body\nposition is going to be.But some things are\nstill going to be hard.So you mentioned boxing.That one works pretty well\nbecause we understand your headposition.We understand your hands.And now, we're increasingly\nunderstanding your bodyposition.But let's say you\nwant to expand thatto Muay Thai or kickboxing.OK.So legs, that's a\ndifferent part of tracking.That's harder because that's\nout of the field of viewmore of the time.But there's also the\nelement of resistance.So you can throw a\npunch, and retract it,and shadow box and do\nthat without upsettingyour physical balance that much.But if you want to\nthrow a roundhouse kickand there's no\none there, then, Imean, the standard way that you\ndo it when you're shadowboxingis you basically\ndo a little 360.But I don't know.Is that going to feel great?I mean, I think there's\na question about whatthat experience should be.And then if you want\nto go even further,if you want to get\ngrappling to work,I'm not even sure\nhow you would dothat without having resistance\nof understanding what the forceis applied to you would be.And then you get\ninto, OK, maybe you'regoing to have some\nkind of bodysuit thatcan apply haptics.But I'm not even sure that even\na pretty advanced haptic systemis going to be able to be\nquite good enough to simulatethe actual forces that would be\napplied to you in a grapplingscenario.So this is part of what's\nfun about technology,though, is you keep on\ngetting new capabilities.And then you need to\nfigure out what things youcan do with them.So I think it's really\nneat that we can do boxing.And we can do the\nsupernatural thing.And there's a bunch\nof awesome cardio,and dancing and\nthings like that.And then there's also\nstill so much moreto do that I'm excited\nto get to over time.But it's a long journey.ANDREW HUBERMAN: And what\nabout

could\nprint out a physical versionof that at the end.This doesn't have to depart\nfrom the physical world.It could end in\nthe physical world.MARK ZUCKERBERG: Did\nyou see the demo,the piano demo where you--either you're there\nwith a physical keyboardor it could be a\nvirtual keyboard.But the app basically\nhighlights what keysyou need to press in\norder to play the song.So it's basically like\nyou're looking at your piano.And it's teaching you how to\nplay a song that you choose.ANDREW HUBERMAN:\nAn actual piano?MARK ZUCKERBERG: Yeah.ANDREW HUBERMAN: But it's\nilluminating certain keysin the virtual space.MARK ZUCKERBERG: Yeah.And it could either be a\nvirtual piano or a keyboardif you don't have a\npiano or keyboard.Or it could use your\nactual keyboard.So yeah, I think\nstuff like that isgoing to be really fascinating\nfor education and expression.ANDREW HUBERMAN: And excuse\nme, but for broadening accessto expensive equipment.I mean, a piano is\nno small expense.MARK ZUCKERBERG: Exactly.ANDREW HUBERMAN: And it\ntakes up a lot of spaceand needs to be tuned.You can think of all\nthese things, the kid thathas very little\nincome or their familyhas very little\nincome could learnto play a virtual piano\nat a much lower cost.MARK ZUCKERBERG: Yeah.And it gets back\nto the question Iwas asking before about this\nthought experiment of howmany of the things\nthat we physically havetoday actually need\nto be physical.The piano doesn't.Maybe there's some\npremium where--maybe it's a somewhat better,\nmore tactile experienceto have a physical one.But for people who don't\nhave the space for it,or who can't afford\nto buy a piano,or just aren't sure\nthat they would wantto make that investment at\nthe beginning of learning howto play piano, I\nthink, in the future,you'll have the option\nof just buying an appor a hologram piano which\nwill be a lot more affordable.And I think that's going to\nunlock a ton of creativity toobecause instead of the\nmarket for piano makersbeing constrained to like a\nrelatively small set of expertswho have perfected\nthat craft, you'regoing to have kids or developers\nall around the world designingcrazy designs for potential\nkeyboards and pianosthat look nothing like\nwhat we've seen before,but maybe bring even\nmore joy or even morefun into the world\nwhere you have fewerof these physical constraints.So I think there's going to be\na lot of wild stuff to explore.ANDREW HUBERMAN:\nThere's definitelygoing to be a lot of\nwild stuff to explore.I just had this\nidea/image in my mindof what you were talking\nabout merged with our earlierconversation when\nPriscilla was here.I could imagine a time\nnot too long from nowwhere you're using mixed reality\nto run experiments in the lab,literally mixing\nvirtual solutions,getting potential outcomes,\nand then picking the bestone to then go actually do\nin the real world, whichis very both financially\ncostly and time-wise costly.MARK ZUCKERBERG: Yeah.I mean, people are already using\nVR for surgery and educationon it.And there's some study that\nwas done that basically triedto do a controlled experiment\nof people who learned howto do a specific surgery\nthrough just the normal textbookand lecture method\nversus you show the kneeand you have it be a\nlarge, blown-up model.And people can manipulate\nit and practicewhere they would make the cuts.And like the people in\nthat class did better.Yeah, I think that it's\ngoing to be profoundfor a lot of different areas.ANDREW HUBERMAN: And the last\nexample that leaps to mind--I think social media\nand online culturehas been accused of creating\na lot of real world--let's call it physical world\nsocial anxiety for people.But I could imagine practicing\na social interaction.Or a kid that has a\nlot of social anxietyor that needs to advocate\nfor themselves betterlearning how to do\nthat progressivelythrough a virtual\ninteraction, and then takingthat to the real world because,\nin my very recent experiencetoday, it's so blended\nnow with real experiencethat the kid that\nfeels terrifiedof advocating for\nthemselves, or just talkingto another human\nbeing, or an adult,or being in a new circumstance\nof a room full of kids, youcould really experience\nthat in silicofirst and get comfortable,\nlet the nervous systemattenuate a bit, and then take\nit into the, quote unquote,\"physical world.\"MARK ZUCKERBERG:\nYeah, I think we'llsee experiences like that.I mean, I also think that\nsome of the social dynamicsaround how people\ninteract in this kindof blended digital world will\nbe more nuanced in other ways.So I'm sure that there will\nbe new anxieties that peopledevelop too, just like teens\ntoday need to navigate dynamicsaround texting\nconstantly that we justdidn't have when we were kids.So I think it will\nhelp with some things.I think that there will be new\nissues that hopefully we canhelp people work through too.But overall, yeah, I\nthink it's going to bereally powerful and positive.ANDREW HUBERMAN: Let's\ntalk about the glasses.MARK ZUCKERBERG: Sure."

could just say,\nhey Meta, I wantto listen to the\nBach variations--the Goldberg Variations of Bach.And Meta responded.And no one around me could hear.But I could hear with\nexquisite clarity.And by the way, I'm not getting\npaid to say any of this.I'm just still\nblown away by this.Folks, I want a\nthese very badly.I could hear, OK, I'm\nselecting those now--or that music now.And then I could hear\nit in the background.But then I could still\nhave a conversation.So this was neither headphones\nin nor headphones out.And I could say,\nwait, pause the music.And it would pause.And the best part was I\ndidn't have to, quote unquote,\"leave the room\" mentally.I didn't even have\nto take out a phone.It was all interfaced through\nthis very local environmentin and around the head.And as a neuroscientist,\nI'm fascinated by thisbecause, of course, all of\nour perceptions-- auditory,visual et cetera--are occurring inside the casing\nof this thing we call a skull.But maybe you could\ncomment on the originof that design for you,\nthe ideas behind that,and where you think it\ncould go because I'm sureI'm just scratching the surface.MARK ZUCKERBERG:\nThe real productthat we want to\neventually get to isthis full augmented\nreality productin a stylish and comfortable\nnormal glasses form factor.ANDREW HUBERMAN: Not a dorky\nVR headset, so to speak?MARK ZUCKERBERG: No, I mean--ANDREW HUBERMAN: Because\nthe VR headset doesfeel kind of big on the face.MARK ZUCKERBERG: There's\ngoing to be a place for that,too, just like you\nhave your laptopand you have your workstation.Or maybe the better analogy\nis you have your phoneand you have your workstation.These AR glasses are going to\nbe like your phone in that youhave something on your face.And you will, I think,\nbe able to, if you want,wear it for a lot of\nthe day and interactwith it very frequently.I don't think that\npeople are goingto be walking around the\nworld wearing VR headsets.ANDREW HUBERMAN: Let's hope.MARK ZUCKERBERG: But yeah,\nthat's certainly not the futurethat I'm hoping we get to.But I do think that there\nis a place for having--because it's a\nbigger form factor,it has more compute power.So just like your workstation\nor your bigger computercan do more than\nyour phone can do,there's a place for\nthat when you wantto settle into an intense task.If you have a doctor\nwho's doing a surgery,I would want them doing\nit through the headsetnot through the phone equivalent\nor the lower powered glasses.But just like phones\nare powerful enoughto do a lot of things, I think\nthe glasses will eventuallyget there, too.Now, that said, there's a\nbunch of really hard technologyproblems to address in order\nto be able to get to this pointwhere you can put full\nholograms in the world.You're basically\nminiaturizing a supercomputerand putting it into a glasses\nso that the glasses stilllook stylish and normal.And that's a really\nhard technology problem.Making things small\nis really hard.A holographic display\nis different from whatour industry has optimized\nfor for 30 or 40 years now,building screens.There's a whole\nindustrial processaround that goes into phones,\nand TVs, and computers,and increasingly so many things\nthat have different screens.There's a whole pipeline\nthat's gotten very goodat making that kind of screen.And the holographic\ndisplays are justa completely different thing\nbecause it's not a screen.It's a thing that\nyou can shoot lightinto through a laser or some\nother kind of projector.And it can place that as\nan object in the world.So that's going to need to be\nthis whole other industrialprocess that gets built up to\ndoing that in an efficient way.So all that said,\nwe're basicallytaking two different approaches\ntowards building this at once.One is we are trying to keep\nin mind what is the long-termthing that--it's not super far off.Within a few years,\nI think we'llhave something that's a first\nversion of this full visionthat I'm talking about.I mean, we have something\nthat's working internallythat we use as a dev kit.But that one, that's\na big challenge.It's going to be more expensive.And it's harder to get\nall the pieces working.The other approach has\nbeen, all right, let'sstart with what\nwe know we can putinto a pair of\nstylish sunglassestoday and just make\nthem as smart as we can.So for the first\nversion, we worked with--we did this collaboration\nwith Ray-Banbecause that's well-accepted.These are well-designed glasses.They're classic.People have used\nthem for decades.For the first version, we\ngot a sensor on the front,so you could capture moments\nwithout having to takeyour phone out of your pocket.So you got photos and videos.You had the speaker\nand the microphone,so you can listen to music.You could communicate with it.But that was the\nfirst version of it.We had a lot of\nthe basics there.But we saw how people used it.And we tuned it.We made the camera twice as\ngood for this new versionthat we made.The audio is a lot\ncrisper for the use casesthat we saw that people actually\nused, which is-- some of itis listening to music.But a lot of it is people want\nto take calls on their glasses.They want to listen to podcasts.But the biggest thing that\nI think is interestingis the ability to get AI running\non it, which it doesn't justrun on the glasses.It also kind of proxies\nthrough your phone.But I mean, with all\nthe advances in LLMs--we talked about this a\nbit in the first partof the conversation.Having the ability to have\nyour Meta AI assistantthat you can just\ntalk to and basicallyask any question\nthroughout the day is--I think it'd be\nreally fascinating.And like you were\nsaying about howwe process the world as\npeople, eventually, Ithink you're going\nto want your AIassistant to be able to see what\nyou see and hear what you hear.Maybe not all the time.But you're going to\nwant to be able to tellit to go into a mode where it\ncan see what you see and hearwhat you hear.And what's the\ndevice design thatbest positions an\nAI assistant to beable to see what\nyou see and hearwhat you hear so it\ncan best help you?Well, that's glasses,\nwhere it basicallyhas a sensor to be able\nto see what you seeand a microphone that is\nclose to your ears thatcan hear what you hear.The other design goal\nis, like you said,to keep you present\nin the world.So I think one of the\nissues with phonesis they pull you away from\nwhat's physically happeningaround you.And I don't think that the\nnext generation of computingwill do that.ANDREW HUBERMAN: I'm\nchuckling to myselfbecause I have a friend.He's a very well\nknown photographer.And he was laughing about\nhow people go to a concert.And everyone's filming\nthe concert on their phoneso that they can be the\nperson that posts the thing.But there are literally\nmillions of other peoplewho posted the exact same thing.But somehow, it feels important\nto post our unique experience.With glasses, that\nwould essentiallysmooth that gap completely.You could just worry about\nit later, download it then.There are issues, I\nrealize, with glassesbecause they are so seamless\nwith everyday experience,even though you and I\naren't wearing them now.It's very common for\npeople to wear glasses--issues of recording and consent.[INTERPOSING VOICES]ANDREW HUBERMAN: Like if I go\nto a locker room at my gym,I'm assuming that the people\nwith glasses aren't filming.Whereas right now, because\nthere's a sharp transition whenthere's a phone in the room\nand someone's pointing it,people generally say, no phones\nin locker rooms and recording.So that's just one instance.I mean, there are\nother instances.MARK ZUCKERBERG: We have\nthe whole privacy light.Did you get--ANDREW HUBERMAN: I didn't\nget a chance to explore that.MARK ZUCKERBERG: Yeah.So anytime that it's\nactive, that the camerasensor is active, it's basically\npulsing a white bright light.ANDREW HUBERMAN: Got it.MARK ZUCKERBERG: Which is, by\nthe way, more than cameras do.ANDREW HUBERMAN: Right.Someone could be\nholding a phone.MARK ZUCKERBERG: Yeah.I mean, phones aren't showing\na light, bright sensorwhen you're taking a photo.ANDREW HUBERMAN:\nPeople oftentimeswill pretend they're texting\nand they're actually recording.I actually saw an instance\nof this in a barber shoponce, where someone\nwas recordingand they were pretending\nthat they were texting.And it was interesting.There was a pretty intense\ninteraction that ensued.And it was like, wow, it's\npretty easy for peopleto feign texting while\nactually recording.MARK ZUCKERBERG: Yeah.So I think when\nyou're evaluatinga risk with a new technology,\nthe bar shouldn't be is itpossible to do anything bad.It's does this new\ntechnology make it easierto do something bad than\nwhat people already had.And I think because you have\nthis privacy light that is justbroadcasting to everyone\naround you, hey,this thing is recording now--I think that makes it\nactually less discreetto do it through the\nglasses than what you coulddo with a phone already, which\nI think is basically the barthat we wanted to get over\nfrom a design perspective.ANDREW HUBERMAN: Thank\nyou for pointing outthat it has the privacy light.I didn't get long\nenough in the experienceto explore all the features.But again, I can think\nof a lot of uses--being able to look at a\nrestaurant from the outsideand see the menu, get a\nstatus on how crowded it is.As much as I love--I don't want to call\nout-- let's justsay app-based map functions\nthat allow you to navigateand the audio is OK.It's nice to have a conversation\nwith somebody on the phoneor in the vehicle.And it'd be great if the road\nwas traced where I should turn.MARK ZUCKERBERG:\nYeah, absolutely.ANDREW HUBERMAN:\nThese kinds of thingsseem like it's going to be\nstraightforward for Metaengineers to create.MARK ZUCKERBERG: Yeah, in\na version, we'll have itso it'll also have the\nholographic display, whereit can show you the directions.But I think that there\nwill basically justbe different price points\nthat pack different amountsof technology.The holographic\ndisplay part, I think,is going to be more\nexpensive than doingone that just has the AI, but\nis primarily communicatingwith you through audio.So I mean, the current\nRay-Ban Meta glasses are $299.I think when we have one\nthat has a display in it,it'll probably be some\namount more than that.But it'll also be more powerful.So I think that\npeople will choosewhat they want to use based\non what the capabilities arethat they want and\nwhat they can afford.But a lot of our goal\nin building thingsis we try to make things that\ncan be accessible to everyone."

            "text": "Our game as a company isn't to\nbuild things and then chargea premium price for it.We try to build things that\nthen everyone can use, and thenbecome more useful because a\nvery large number of peopleare using them.So it's just a very\ndifferent approach.We're not like Apple or some\nof these companies that justtry to make something and\nthen sell it for as muchas they can, which, I mean,\nthey're a great company.So I mean, I think that\nmodel is fine, too.But our approach\nis going to be wewant stuff that\ncan be affordableso that way everyone in\nthe world can use it.ANDREW HUBERMAN:\nLong lines of health,I think the glasses will\nalso potentially solvea major problem in\na real way, whichis the following for\nboth children and adults.It's very clear that viewing\nobjects in particular screensup close for too many hours\nper day leads to myopia.It literally changes the\nlength of length of the eyeballand nearsightedness.And on the positive\nside, we know,based on some really\nlarge clinical trials,that kids who spend--and adults who spend two hours\na day or more out of doorsdon't experience that and maybe\neven reverse their myopia.And it has something to do\nwith exposure to sunlight.But it has a lot to do\nwith long view, viewingthings at a distance greater\nthan three or four feet away.And with the glasses,\nI realize, onecould actually do digital\nwork out of doors.It could measure and\ntell you how much timeyou've spent looking at things\nup close versus far away.I mean, this is just another\nexample that leaps to mind.But in accessing\nthe visual system,you're effectively\naccessing the whole brainbecause it's the only\ntwo bits of brain thatare outside the cranial\nvault. So it justseems like putting technology\nright at the level of the eyes,seeing what the\neyes see, has justgot to be the best way to go.MARK ZUCKERBERG: Yeah.Well, multimodal, I think, is--\nyou want the visual sensation.But you also want\ntext or language.ANDREW HUBERMAN: Sure.That all can be brought to\nthe level of the eyes, right?MARK ZUCKERBERG: What\ndo you mean by that?ANDREW HUBERMAN:\nWell, I mean, I thinkwhat we're describing\nhere is essentiallytaking the phone, the\ncomputer, and bringing itall to the level of the eyes.And of course, one would like--MARK ZUCKERBERG: Oh,\nPhysically at your eyes?ANDREW HUBERMAN: Physically\nat your eyes, right?MARK ZUCKERBERG: Yeah.ANDREW HUBERMAN: And one\nwould like more kinestheticinformation, as you mentioned\nbefore-- where the legs are,maybe even lung function.Hey, have you taken\nenough steps today?But that all can be-- if it can\nbe figured out on the phone,it can be-- by the phone, it can\nbe figured out by the glasses.But there's additional\ninformation there,such as what are you\nfocusing on in your world.How much of your time is spent\nlooking at things far awayversus up close?How much social time\ndid you have today?It's really tricky to\nget that with a phone.If my phone were\nright in front of usas if we were at\na standard lunchnowadays, certainly\nin Silicon Valley,and then we're peering\nat our phones, I mean,how much real direct attention\nand was in the conversationat hand versus something else?You can get issues\nof where are youplacing your attention\nby virtue of whereyou're placing your eyes.And I think that information\nis not accessiblewith a phone in your\npocket or in front of you.Yeah, I mean, a little bit, but\nnot nearly as rich and completeinformation as one\ngets when you're reallypulling the data from\nthe level of visionand what kids and\nadults are actuallylooking at and attending to.MARK ZUCKERBERG: Yeah, yeah.ANDREW HUBERMAN: It\nseems extremely valuable.You get autonomic information,\nsize of the pupils.So you get information\nabout internal states.MARK ZUCKERBERG: I mean, there's\ninternal sensor and outside.So the sensor on the Ray-Ban\nMeta glasses is external.So it basically allows\nyou to see what you see--sorry, the AI system to\nsee what you're seeing.There's a separate\nset of things whichare eye tracking, which are\nalso very powerful for enablinga lot of interfaces.So if you want to\njust look at somethingand select it by looking\nat it with your eyesrather than having to drag\na controller over or pick upa hologram or\nanything like that,you can do that\nwith eye tracking.So that's a pretty profound and\ncool experience, too, as wellas just understanding\nwhat you'relooking at so that way you're\nnot wasting compute powerdrawing pixels and\nhigh resolutionin a part of the world\nthat's going to bein your peripheral vision.So yeah, all of\nthese things, thereare interesting design\nand technology trade-offs,where if you want the external\nsensor, that's one thing.If you also want\nthe eye tracking,now that's a different\nset of sensors.Each one of these\nconsumes compute,which consumes battery.They take up more space.So it's like, where are the eye\ntracking sensors going to be?It's like, well, you\nwant to make surethat the rim of the glasses is\nactually quite thin because--I mean, there's a variance\nof how thick can glassesbe before they look more\nlike goggles than glasses.So I think that there's\nthis whole space.And I think people are going\nto end up choosing whatproduct makes sense for them.Maybe they want something\nthat's more powerful,that has more of the\nsensors, but it'sgoing to be a little\nmore expensive,maybe like slightly thicker.Or maybe you want\na more basic thingthat just looks very similar\nto what Ray-Ban glasses arethat people have been wearing\nfor decades but has AI in itand you can capture\nmoments without havingto take your phone out\nand send them to people.In the latest version, we got\nthe ability in to live stream.I think that that's pretty\ncrazy, that now you can be--going back to your concert case\nor whatever else you're doing,you can be doing\nsports or watchingyour kids play something.And you can be watching.And you can be live streaming\nit to your family group,so people can see it.I think that stuff is--I think that's pretty\ncool, that you basicallyhave a normal looking glasses at\nthis point that can live streamand has an AI assistant.So the stuff is making\na lot faster progressin a lot of ways than\nI would have thought.And I don't know.I think people are going\nto like this version.But there's a lot\nmore still to do.ANDREW HUBERMAN: I think\nit's super exciting.And I see a lot of technologies.This one's particularly\nexciting to mebecause of how smooth\nthe interface isand for all the reasons\nthat you just mentioned.What's happening with and\nwhat can we expect around"

            "text": "AI interfaces and\nmaybe even avatarsof people within social media?Are we not far off\nfrom a day wherethere are multiple\nversions of meand you on the\ninternet or people?For instance, I get\nasked a lot of questions.I don't have the opportunity to\nrespond to all those questions.But with things\nlike ChatGPT, peopleare trying to generate\nanswers to those questionson other platforms.Will I have the\nopportunity to soonhave an AI version of\nmyself where peoplecan ask me questions about\nwhat I recommend for sleepand circadian rhythm, fitness,\nmental health, et cetera basedon content I've\nalready generatedthat will be accurate so they\ncould just ask my avatar?MARK ZUCKERBERG: Yeah,\nthis is somethingthat I think a lot\nof creators are goingto want that we're\ntrying to buildand I think we'll probably\nhave a version of next year.But there's a bunch\nof constraintsthat I think we need to\nmake sure that we get right.So for one, I think it's\nreally important that--it's not that there's a\nbunch of versions of you.It's that if anyone is creating\nan AI assistant version of you,it should be something\nthat you control.I think there are some platforms\nthat are out there todaythat just let people like make--I don't know-- an AI bought\nof me or other figures.And it's like, I don't know.I mean, we have\nplatform policies for--and for decades,\nsince the beginningof the company at this point,\nwhich is almost 20 years,that basically don't\nallow impersonation.Real identity is like\none of the core aspectsthat our company was started on.You want to authentically\nbe yourself.So yeah, I think if\nyou're almost any creator,being able to engage\nyour community--and there's just going\nto be more demandto interact with you than\nyou have hours in the day.So there are both\npeople who out therewho would benefit from\nbeing able to talkto an AI version of you.And I think you,\nand other creators,would benefit from being able\nto keep your community engagedand service that demand that\npeople have to engage with you.But you're going to want to\nknow that that AI version of youor assistant is going\nto represent youthe way that you would want.And there are a\nlot of things thatare awesome about\nthese modern LLMs.But having perfect\npredictabilityabout how it's going\nto represent somethingis not one of the\ncurrent strengths.So I think that\nthere's some work thatneeds to get done there.I don't think it needs to be\n100% perfect all the time.But you need to have very\ngood confidence, I would say,that it's going to represent\nyou the way that you'dwant for you to\nwant to turn it on,which, again, you\nshould have control overwhether you turn it on.So we wanted to start in\na different place, whichI think is a somewhat easier\nproblem, which is creatingnew characters for AI personas.So that way, it's not--we built one of the\nAIs is like a chef.And they can help you\ncome up with thingsthat you could cook and\ncan help you cook them.There's a couple\nof people that areinterested in different\ntypes of fitness thatcan help you plan\nout your workoutsor help with recovery or\ndifferent things like that.There's an AI that's\nfocused on DIY crafts.There's somebody who's\na travel expert thatcan help you make travel\nplans or give you ideas.But the key thing\nabout all of theseis they're not modeled\noff of existing people.So they don't have to have\n100% fidelity to making surethat they never say something\nthat a real person who they'remodeled after would never say\nbecause they're just made upcharacters.So I think that that's a\nsomewhat easier problem.And we actually got a bunch\nof different well-known peopleto play those characters\nbecause we thoughtthat would make it more fun.So there's like Snoop Dogg\nis the dungeon master.So you can drop\nhim into a threadand play text-based games.And I do this with my daughter\nwhen I tuck her in at night.And she just loves storytelling.And it's like Snoop Dogg,\nas the dungeon master,will come up with here's\nwhat's happening next.And she's like, OK, I\nturn into a mermaid.And then I like\nswim across the bay.And I go and find the\ntreasure chest and unlock it.And it's like, and then\nSnoop Dogg just alwayswill have a next\nversion of the--a next iteration on the story.So I mean, it's\nstuff that's fun.But it's not\nactually Snoop Dogg.He's just the actor who's\nplaying the dungeon master,which makes it more fun.So I think that's probably\nthe right place to start,is you can build versions\nof these charactersthat people can interact\nwith doing different things.But I think where\nyou want to get overtime is to the place where any\ncreator or any small businesscan very easily just create an\nAI assistant that can representthem and interact with your\ncommunity or customers,if you're a business,\nand basically just helpyou grow your enterprise.So I think that's\ngoing to be cool.It's a long-term project.I think we'll have more progress\non it to report on next year.But I think that's coming.ANDREW HUBERMAN: I'm\nsuper excited about itbecause we hear a lot\nabout the downsides of AI.I mean, I think people are now\ncoming around to the realitythat AI is neither good nor bad.It can be used for good or bad.And there are a lot of\nlife-enhancing spacesthat it's going to show\nup and really, reallyimprove the way that we engage\nsocially, what we learn,and that mental health\nand physical healthdon't have to\nsuffer and, in fact,can be enhanced by the\nsorts of technologieswe've been talking about.So I know you're extremely busy.I so appreciate the\nlarge amount of timeyou've given me today to sort\nthrough all these things.MARK ZUCKERBERG:\nYeah, it's been fun.ANDREW HUBERMAN: And to\ntalk with you and Priscillaand to hear what's happening\nand where things are headed,the future certainly is bright.I share in your optimism.And it's been only strengthened\nby today's conversation.So thank you so much.And keep doing\nwhat you're doing.And on behalf of myself\nand everyone listening,thank you because, regardless\nof what people say,we all use these\nplatforms excitedly.And it's clear that\nthere's a ton of intention,and care, and thought about what\ncould be in the positive sense.And that's really\nworth highlighting.MARK ZUCKERBERG:\nAwesome, thank you.I appreciate it.ANDREW HUBERMAN: Thank\nyou for joining mefor today's discussion with Mark\nZuckerberg and Dr. Priscilla"
