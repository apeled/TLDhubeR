startedusing the waking up app a few years agobecause even though I've been doingregular meditation since my teens and Istarted doing Yoga Nidra about a decadeago my dad mentioned to me that he hadfound an app turned out to be the wakingup app which could teach you meditationsof different durations and that had alot of different types of meditations toplay place the brain and body intodifferent states and that he liked itvery much so I gave the waking up app atry and I too found it to be extremelyuseful because sometimes I only have afew minutes to meditate other times Ihave longer to meditate and indeed Ilove the fact that I can exploredifferent types of meditation to bringabout different levels of understandingabout Consciousness but also to place mybrain and body into lots of differentkinds of States depending on whichmeditation I do I also love that thewaking up app has lots of differenttypes of Yoga Nidra sessions for thoseof you don't know Yoga Nidra is aprocess of lying very still but keepingan active mind it's very different thanmost meditations and there's excellentscientific data to show that yoganidraand something similar to it callednon-sleep deep rest

30-day trialagain that's waking up.com huberman toaccess a free 30-day trial okay let'stalk about tools for improving mood andmental health I think it goes withoutsaying that these are extremelyimportant topics for everyone not justto know about but in my opinion also forpeople to implement and the reason isthat we are currently in a worldwideMental Health crisis and while we coulddebate the reason why we are in aworldwide Mental Health crisis it's veryvery clear that mood disorders andchallenges with mental health aboutfound and of course there are manydifferent therapies for the treatment ofmood disorders and mental healtheverything from talk therapy with apsychologist or psychiatrist or socialworker prescription drug treatmentsthere nutritional approaches sematicapproaches and I want to be clear that Ido believe that there's value in all ofthese approaches what tends to matter interms of what sorts of tools andapproaches one adopts includes bothaccess so whether or not people haveaccess to these type of therapieswhether or not they can afford them on aconsistent basis and also of course theseverity of the mood or mental healthdisorder and I'd be remiss of course ifI didn't make the statement and I don'tsay this just to protect me I also saythis to protect all of you and thosethat you know that if you are concernedabout yourself or somebody else having aserious mood or mental health disorderplease do seek out help from a licensedclinical psychologist or psychiatrist orother healthc care professional who'squalified to help you in that regardwith that said we can now have adiscussion about tools and protocols forenhancing mood and mental health thattruly appli to everybody regardless ofage to start off I want to talk about afundamental aspect of mood and mentalhealth enhancement that was discussedboth in the guest episode with Dr LisaFeldman Barrett as well as in the guestseries with Dr Paul Ki and that has todo with what Dr Paul Ki referred to asthe first principles of self-care ormental health the first principles ofself-care include but are not limited totaking excellent care of one's biologywhich of course includes both the mindand the body and in order to make thisvery simple and actionable I'vedistilled out what I refer to as the bigsix I've sometimes refer to these as thesix major pillars of Health both mentalhealth and physical health as well asperformance for that matter but if we'regoing to talk about tools for mood andmental health we absolutely can'tdiscard discussions about our biologythat is we need to make sure that we'retaking care of our normal biologicalfunction and indeed enhancing theproduction of specific neurotransmittersand neuromodulators that we areoptimizing yes I use the word optimizingthe function of our so-called autonomicnervous system that aspect of ournervous system that's humming in thebackground all the time it's operatingunconsciously to regulate our sleep wakeCycles it's regulating how well orpoorly we react to things it'sregulating how much dopamine serotoninepinephrine acetylcholine we wereproducing all of this stuff is hummingin the background and sets the stage forall the conscious work that we might putto for instance trying to understandwhat our life narrative is what ourunconscious mind is doing what sorts ofdefenses it might producing all of thesort of high level and directed workthat we're going to talk about a littlebit later exists on a background ofautonomic function of neurotransmitterproduction of hormone production notjust testosterone and estrogen butthings like cortisol prolactin and onand on so it's important to understandthat if our goal is to be in the bestpossible mood given our lifecircumstances and to have the bestpossible mental health given our lifecircumstances and to improve our moodand mental health consistently over timethat we have to pay attention to whatI'm referring to here as the big six orthe six pillars of mental health andthose are just to list them off thenI'll go into a little bit more detailsleep Sun sunlight although I'd like tomodify sunlight because based on somenew data that just came out a couple ofweeks ago I'd like to now make thatsecond pillar not sunlight but light SLdark so we could even just think aboutit as light when and how much light youget but what you'll soon learn is thathow much dark you get is also extremelyimportant so we've got sleep lightmovement is the third nutrition socialconnection and Stress Control now theseare topics that I've spoken aboutextensively on previous huin Lab podcastepisodes so I don't want to go into adeep dive of each of these six pillarsright now but I am going to just giveyou a few highlights of each and then ofcourse we will provide links in the shownote captions for which you can go onthe Deep dive if you like and I alsowould like to mention that if you everhave questions about specific protocolsor tools and you're seeking those out orprevious episodes or specific timestampsof previous episodes of this podcast youcan go to our newly revamped hubmanlab.com webbsite and put any topic ofInterest or even several topics ofInterest into the search function and itwill take you to the very specifictimestamps and other resources thatprovide information on those topics soI'm going to go into a few of the keybullet points about each of the sixpillars or what I also refer to as thebig six of self-care and mental healthagain this is a necessary list but isnot sufficient again necessary to dothese things every 24 hours hours indeedevery 24 hours if you want to have thebest possible mood and mental health butit is not sufficient that means youstill need to do some of the otherthings that we're going to talk about interms of directed approaches atimproving mood and mental health if youare to quote unquote optimize your moodand mental health or if you are let'sjust say trying to constantly improveyour mood and mental health but theseare the necessary but not sufficientpillars of mental health so Under TheHeading of sleep it's safe to say that"

            "text": "used to refer to this as sunlight rightI'd say and I'm going to say it againnow although I've covered this in a lotmore detail so again just hitting thetop Contour criticalelements try to view sunlight that iswith your eyes view sunlight as early aspossible after waking whenever I saythat the most common question I get iswhat do I do if I wake up before the suncomes out well unless you havesuperpowers that I'm not aware of youcan't make the sun come out any earlierso just flip on artificial lights asneeded until the sun comes out and thenget outside face East in the morningtake off those sunglasses it's perfectlysafe to look at low solar angle sunlightwithout sunglasses providing you're notyou know driving into bright light andyou crash this kind of thing get outsidelook at the sunlight definitely blink toprotect your eyes as needed but get thatsunlight in your eyes early in the daythis has Myriad positive effects on moodfocus and alertness and nighttime sleeplater that night and it does so througha number of well-defined biological andendocrine hormonal Pathways that I'vediscussed on many previous podcastepisodes and you want to do this forabout 10 minutes on non- overcast daysand as long as 20 or 30 minutes onovercast days and that highlights thesecond most common question I get whichis what do I do if there's no sun whereI live I live in an area where there'sno sunlight look if you live on planetEarth there's always sunlight theremight not be very much of it it might bevery overcast where you live it mightseem very dark but trust me there's farmore photons light energy coming throughthat cloud cover even in the darkestmornings of winter than there are atnight in those dark Winters so get thatlight in your eyes and do it asconsistently as possible and also dothat in the late afternoon and eveningthat's critical for regulating yourcircadian clock for reasons that I'vetalked about previously but I'll getinto in a future podcast reallyexplaining how those clock oscillatorsand mechanisms work but just to keep itreally simple since this this is atoolkit episode for mood and mentalhealth your mood and your mental healthwill benefit tremendously from gettingmorning sunlight in your eyes now if youneed to get more light in your eyesbecause indeed there's just not enoughsunlight or you don't have theopportunity to get outside and viewsunlight in the morning for whateverreason you might invest in getting abright light source that you can plug inyou probably want one that's as brightas 10,000 lucks so that's pretty brightthose fall under the category ofso-called sad lamps sad Seasonaleffective disorder lamps and you canpurchase those they can be somewhatexpensive you can also opt to get a 900Lu drawing tablet by the way I have noFinancial relationship to any of thesesorts of light sources but you can findthem pretty easily and in the case ofthe 900 Lux light tablet um fairlyinexpensively online and you can putthat on your desk or where you have yourmorning coffee and try and enhance thetotal amount of light that you'regetting in the morning but franklynothing is as good as sunlight so if youcan't get sunlight you might think aboutinvesting in one of those sad lamps andindeed those sad lamps aren't as good assunlight but they are the next bestthing if you really can't get sunlighton a consistent basis a few other finepoints that I always get asked aboutfirst of all it is absolutely okay towear eyeglasses or contact lenses thosesorts of corrective lenses are actuallygoing to focus the light to your retinawhich is where you want it however thiswhole process of viewing morningsunlight and afternoon light does notagain does not work through a window orwindshield because windows andwindshields filter out the relevantwavelengths of light that you want toget directly onto your retina okay sothat's the reality of it in additionplease don't feel that you have to lookdirectly at the Sun and certainly don'tstare at the Sun never force yourself tolook at any light sunlight or otherwisethat's so bright that it's painful tolook at so if it's comfortable for youto look directly at the Sun and justblink every once in a while and you cando that without any pain or discomfortor watering of the eyes please do thatyou're getting a lot of photons intoyour eyes and they're transmitting thatto your brein brain and your brain tothe rest of your body and on and onhowever if you find it uncomfortable tolook directly at the sun in that casewhat you'll want to do is offset yourgaze to you know 10 or 20 degrees whichis nerd speak for just a little bit tothe right or a little bit to the leftand get the sunlight into your eyesindirectly okay and I often also getasked well can I stand in the shadewhile I do this what if I have anoverhang in my apartment the best thingis of course going to be to facedirectly to the Sun and look eitherdirectly at it or slightly offset but ifyou can only get morning sunlight bygoing out onto your balcony and yourbalcony doesn't face East rather itfaces West you'll still get a lot ofphotons from the Sun Reaching Your Eyesthere but ideally you would find someway to look toward the sun first thingin the morning I realize that with kidsand work and other obligations this canbe challenging but it is a challengeworth meeting meaning don't lose yourjob or forget to take care of your kidsto do this but you can bring your kidsto do this and indeed you should it setstheir circadian rhythms also so andpeople often will ask well does it workon dogs you know and indeed dogs andother animals have these exact samecircuits and Pathways for setting theircircadian rhythm so it's great for themtoo now there are also clear anddocumented benefits for mood and mentalhealth to getting bright light in youreyes ideally from sunlight throughoutthe day as much as you safely can pleasedon't get sunburned don't get cataractsby getting too much sunlight but gettingoutdoors and getting sunlight in youreyes during your lunch break or a walkhere and there or if you have to remainindoors during the day getting thelights in that environment as bright aspossible as safely possible I should sayis known to improve mood and mentalhealth why well because there's aspecial so-called opsin within the cellsof your eyes it's called melanopsin thatdoesn't respond to the same differencesin color that are present in sunlight inthe morning and the evening but ratherresponds to the overall brightness oflight so very bright lights either fromartificial sources or ideally fromsunlight activate these cells and thesecells project these little wires we callaxons into specific parts of the brainthat improve your mood and feelings ofwell-being so I can't give you aspecific number you know of five minutesa day or 10 minutes a day just get asmuch light in your eyes ideally fromsunlight throughout the day as is safefor you meaning where you're not gettingsunburned and you're not damaging yourretina and if you want to know if you'redamaging your retina well anytime youhave to Blink or turn away from lightbecause it's really bright that's asignal that the light is too bright sowhile you want to place yourself intobright environments you don't want toplace yourself into any environment sobright that it's painful to be in okayso use that as a metric and you shouldbe just fine and the last point aboutlight for mood and mental health is a"

put the pluralof serieses in the show in the commentson YouTube the third pillar is movementand when I say movement I mean exerciseas you all know we should all strive toget anywhere from 180 to 220 minutes ofZone 2 cardio per week that's movementthat allows you to hold a conversationbut where you to do it more intensely oreven a bit more intensely you wouldn'tbe able to hold that conversation inaddition we should do some V2 Max workwe should get our heart rate very highat least once a week doing some sort ofmovement that's safe for you so thatcould be running or cycling or swimmingor Pilates whatever it is for yougetting your heart rate way way up isalso important and to do that at leastonce a week but daily movement eithercardiovascular training or resistancetraining and it's very very clear thatwe need both maybe not on the same daysin fact I split them to separate daysresistance training done for anywherefrom six to 10 sets per muscle groupeither close to or to failure this couldbe with weights it could be with bandsit could be with machines all of thatwas covered in detail in the podcastseries that I did with Dr Andy Galpin anexercise physiologist who's expert inall those areas I also did an episode ona foundational Fitness protocol that hasbeen distilled into a very simplethree-page PDF that you can get forcompletely zero cost by going to hulab.com and just put foundationalFitness protocol PDF and you'll be takento that toolkit so all of the details ofa weekly exercise routine that involvesdaily movement but also certainly in mycase includes at least one full day ofrest per week because many people doindeed need one maybe even two full daysof rest per week so that highlights thethird pillar movement but we know thatcardiovascular training and resistancetraining aren't just great for our bodythey also improve mood and mental healththat's so very clear from the researchliterature so we can't Overlook those ina conversation about mood and mentalhealth now the fourth pillar isnutrition and nutrition is a big topicit's a very barbed wire topic if you getinvolved in this stuff online you knowyou you've got your people who believethat you know carnivore is better thanvegan you have the people who believevegan is better than carnivore mostpeople are omnivores you have your seedoil debates and on and on and on we'renot going to touch any of that nowindeed if you want to learn more aboutnutrition and what works and whatdoesn't work for sake of aestheticchanges weight loss muscle gain Etc Iwould refer you to the guest episodethat we did with Dr Lane Norton you canfind that again at huberman lab.comwhere we do a deep dive on all thevariations in different nutritionalprotocols but suffice to say thatregardless of whether or not you'revegan omnivore carnivore or keto orwhatever everybody needs to consumesufficient amounts but not excessamounts of quality calories per day nowyou may do that by intermittent fastingyou may do that by a more traditionalmeal scheduling but everybody's going toneed to do that because your body andbrain and indeed the parts of your bodyand brain that translate to mood andmental health require macronutrientsproteins fats and carbohydrates as wellas micronutrients so the key takeawaywith nutrition is to make it qualitynutrition within the bounds of whateversort of nutritional program that you'refollowing and that means getting most ofyour food sources from eithernonprocessed or minimally processedfoods so these would be foods thatyou're going to need to prepare or foodsthat would perish um over time these arenot the sorts of foods that live inboxes and cans and other uh packagesthat would allow them to live on theshelves forever and ever okay and as Isay that I know many people are shoutingwell what about rice you know rice canlive on the shelf for a long time andyes okay I consider rice a minimallyprocessed food because of course it canlive on the shelf for a long period oftime and here I'm just going to back outof the whole conversation aboutnutrition at this point because as youcan probably tell it's a deep series ofrabbit holes that we can fall into andreally get distracted the point is makesure you're getting enough food don'tovereat we know energy toxicity is aproblem for not just body compositionbut for mental health so you want to getenough calories but not too few caloriesand you want to make sure that you'regetting them from quality sources and Isay that because of course food is notjust the substrate for the cellularrepair and indeed production of tissuesin your body but it's also the substratefor all the sorts of neurotransmittersright which are derived from amino acidprecursors that are derived from foodright all of that dopamine stuff andserotonin stuff is derived from aminoacids that come from food sources so thelink between nutrition and mental healthshould now be an obvious one as we all"

number ofsocial interactions that we feel tax oreven Vex us that cause us stress this issomething that was covered in depth inthe episode with Dr Lisa Feldman Barrettwhere she talked about the fact that wedon't just have a nervous system thatregulates itself through experience andthrough our thoughts and our actions weare as a species interacting with othernervous systems both of our own speciesother humans as well as non-humanspecies dogs and cats and if you havethem horses and other animals so we needto think about our nervous system asbeing both regulated from the inside andthrough our own actions and choices andthoughts but also through interactionwith other nervous systems and while wedon't always have as much control overWhich social interactions or workinteractions we have to engage in weshould really strive to understand andindeed pay some serious attention towhether or not certain types of socialinteractionsare what she referred to as net savingsneutral or taxing right certain types ofsocial interactions with certain peopleor groups of people just make us feeltaxed it makes us feel stressed it leadsto negative affect that is not goodfeelings or emotions and often elevatedlevels of autonomic arousal that leaveus ruminating and leave us havingchallenges with sleep we really shouldall strive to limit those interactionsto the extent that we can on the reverseside of that as Lisa Felman Barrett sobeautifully pointed out we also have thecapability to regulate each other'snervous systems in ways that producesavings that is that allow us to feeland indeed cause physiological changesthat make us feel not just happier notjust relaxed not just happy because weenjoy interacting with somebody but or agroup but that give us a savings thatgive us the kind of resources literallymetabolic and neurochemical resourcesthat make us feel more capable and giveus a sense of elevated mood and improvedmental health when we are not engagingwith those people and this is highlysubjective of course but you should beable to distinguish in fact I encourageyou to spend a little bit of time maybeeven just five or 10 minutes thinkingabout you know who are the individualsand groups that I interact with thatleave me feeling taxed you know thatreally seem to drain my energy and haveme ruminating and in a not good spacewhen I leave whatever interaction I hadwith them this could be a realinteraction or online interaction indeedI did this the other day based on Lisa'ssuggestion I found it to be tremendouslyuseful what I did is I decided to and bythe way this was happening on a runwhere I was thinking you know a lot ofmy mind is in a conversation with peoplethat aren't even here I was sort ofworking through a conversation I wasthinking about what I would say what Idid say what they said in an interactionthat unfortunately was pretty unpleasantit wasn't extremely unpleasant but itwas pretty unpleasant and I realizedokay that that is a sort of interactionthat I would like to avoid in the futurebecause it wasn't happening right thenbut it was carried forward into aportion of my day my morning run thatfor me is normally very pleasureful andquite sacred to me actually so payingsome attention to how much of yourinternal dialogue is with yourselfversus with others and how much of thatis positive or negative is extremelybeneficial and I'm not talking aboutalways just thinking about oneself andnot thinking about others to thecontrary we also need to think as Lisapointed out about who are the peoplewith whom we interact with or observethat lead us to have ongoing dialoguewith them in our mind or think aboutthose interactions in ways that give usenergy that lead to energetic savingsliterally metabolic savings that we canapply not just in those interactions butin our work Endeavors and our soloEndeavors whatever that we're doing whenwe are away from those people so whilethis concept of savings or neutral ortaxation of our metabolic and ourneurochemical systems might seem alittle bit squishy it is not squishythis is a neurobiological concept it'salso a psychological concept and it'sone that I'm so glad that Lisa broughtup because social connection socialinteraction is so vital to our mood andmental health but oftentimes we hearsocial connection we think oh that meanswe have to spend a lot of time withfriends we have to organize dinnerparties well sure that's all fine andgood if you can do that and I do ofcourse encourage people to spend timewith those that they love but it's alsoimportant to take a step back and justthink a bit maybe even write out a bityou know who are the groups and sorts ofindividuals and interactions that reallytax you who are the people you find kindof neutral and what are the individualsand groups that really provide what Lisareferred to as savings that is they tapinto the metabolic and neurochemicalPathways that lead us to have improvedmood and mental health not just

            "text": "reason it's included is that look stressis going to happen life is filled withso-called stressors and for a goodnumber of years in fact the last 15years there's been a lot of debate inthe field of Psychology and Neuroscienceas well whether or not stress is goodfor us whether or not stress is bad forus whether or not we simply need toreframe stress as good or bad and tosome extent all of that is true you knowwe know that chronic stress is not goodfor our memory our immune system or ourhealth we also know that if youunderstand the reality which is thatstress also allows us to harness ourmental and physical resources to performbetter than we would otherwise incertain circumstances and that providedwe can get to sleep each night thatperhaps stress isn't so bad and perhapsis even performance enhancing I talkedabout this in the guest episode with DrAli Crumb from the psychology departmentat Stanford and I've talked about thisin other podcasts as well and I'm nothere to tell you that stress is good foryou I'm not here to tell you that stressis bad for you what I am going to tellyou is that it is extremely importantthat we all have readily accessibleStress Management tools that work thefirst time and every time and these fallinto two categories the first categoryare realtime tools so tools that you canuse to reduce your level of stress inreal time and the best way that I'maware of that's grounded in excellentphysiology and Neuroscience to reduceyour stress in real time is theso-called physiological side I did notinvent this pattern of breathing it'snot breath work per se this is a patternof breathing that we all naturally do inour sleep to restore carbon dioxide andoxygen levels to their proper ratios wealso do it periodically throughout theday without noticing indeed we have adefined or specific neural circuit inour brain that extends to our diaphragmand communicates with aspects of ourheart Etc that allow physiological sizeto calm us down faster at least in myknowledge than any other directedprotocol and the physiological sigh asmany of you know is very simple andstraightforward anyone can do this yousimply do a big inhale through your nosetry and maximize the inflation of yourlungs and then before you exhale sneakin another brief inhalation even if it'sjust a tiny micro inhalation tomaximally inflate the lungs and that hasan important effect on the little Sachsin the lungs called the avioli of thelungs it's going to open up whateveravioli we collapsed in there and thenyou're going to do a long extendedexhale through the mouth and typicallyjust one although sometimes it requirestwo or three but just one physiologicalsigh is effective in bringing down one'slevel of stress significantly enoughthat you don't need to do it again sothis can be done essentially anywhereand by anyone I suppose probablycouldn't do it if you were underwater orcertainly don't do it if you'reunderwater but otherwise it's a verysafe and very effective way to calm downand reduce your levels of stress in realtime maybe before public speaking or inwhatever circumstance you feel you needto calm down in real time so I'lldemonstrate the physiological side foryou here I've done this many timesbefore in previous episodes but forthose of you that haven't heard or seenthose episodes I feel obligated to do itagain now okay so it's a deep inhalethrough the nose followed by anotherbrief inhale through the nose and then along exhale through the mouth and beforeyou start asking questions about what doI do if I have a deviated septum can itbe just through the mouth do the firsttwo through the nose do the thirdthrough the mouth so it's likethis and indeed I feel calmer and indeedif you do it you will feel calmer you'llnotice that second inhale through thenose was kind of sharp in the sense thatI had to really push um put somephysical effort into making it happenand you know my shoulders jolted upwardsif you just listening to this and notwatching my shoulders jolted upwardsthat second inhale through the nose isimportant for a variety of reasons I'vetalked about elsewhere so thephysiological sigh is going to be thego-to protocol for you again notinvented by me this is not hubermanbreathing this is a pattern of breathingdiscovered in the 1930s by physiologistsit's hardwired into our nervous systemand that's what makes it so great itworks the first time and it works everytime so that's to my knowledge the bestway to control your stress in real timenow why is that important for mood andmental health well as we'll talk aboutlaterif you want to access your so-calledgenerative drive a theme that we'regoing to get into in a bit more detailthis is something that came up duringthe series with Dr Paul kti you willlearn that stress and anger and negativeemotions while they can be verymotivating very arousing they are notgoing to be good for your long-term moodand mental health period so having toolsto regulate your stress and your levelsof anger your levels of reactivity andalso to elevate your feelings of agencyand control over your life starting withagency and control over your physiologyyour internal state is going to be vitaland what I love about the physiologicalsigh is that of course it's completelyzero cost but also there's a dedicatedcircuit in your brain and body for thisparticular pattern of breathing we do itspontaneously but you can do itintentionally and it works just as wellif not better to regulate your levels ofstress that is to bring them down whichhas outsize positive effects on yourmood and mental health not just in themoment but also should improve yourconfidence that when stress comesbecause the world is filled withstressors it's not if it's when whenstress

severe moodor mental health disorder or you findyourself to be reasonably healthy withrespect to mood and mental health andyou simply want your mood and mentalhealth to be stable and or improve overtime time now the reason why the big sixthose six pillars are so important formood and mental health and indeed form acritical component of what Dr Paul ktireferred to as the first principles ofself-care is that those six pillarsestablish a millu that is an environmentof neurochemicals includingneuromodulators such as dopamineserotonin epinephrine norepinephrineacetylcholine and other neurochemicalsas well as well as hormones totestosterone estrogen prolactin cortisoland immune molecules and on and on thatlead to a high degree of predictabilityin your brain and nervous system nowwhat do I mean by that why wouldpredictability be such a key componentof mood and mental health is it reallyjust about knowing that you're going tofeel energized in the early part of theday and tired at the end of the day nowthat might be part of it but that's notthe major takeaway the major takeaway isthat as Dr Lisa Feldman Barrett so aptlypoint pointed out your brain and indeedyour entire nervous system has a coupleof major jobs you know it has the job ofregulating your breathing and your heartrate Etc it also has the job ofregulating your thinking and yourplanning and your memory those are thejobs of the brain and nervous systemthat we normally hear about but if wethink about the more macro jobs that thebrain has the key function of the braincertainly the parts of the brain thatare more recently evolved the onesinvolved in thinking and planning Etcare really involved involved ingenerating predictions predictions aboutwhat's going to happen next and whetheror not you're going to be prepared forwhat's going to happen next and indeedDr Lisa Felman Barrett also beautifullyIllustrated this model of the brain asregulating a brain body budget and moodsand a related topic which she calledaffect okay I'll explain what affect isin a moment setting the stage for beingable to better predict what's going tohappen next and thereforeregulating your mood in the moment let'sjust take a moment and explore thatstatement in a little bit more detailessentially what she was saying and whatI'm now again saying is that your brainand body go through different statesyour state at a given moment can belabeled as your affect your affectincludes a lot of different thingsincluding levels of autonomic arousallevels of hormones levels oftransmitters all of that stuff but itfalls under the umbrella of affectaffect essentially sets the stage forparticular emotions to be more likely orless likely to emerge so emotion andaffect aren't the same thing affect is abit more General and sort of undergirdsthe possibility of having certain moodslike feeling elated happy or sad ordepressed it really sets the generalstage for different types of specificemotions even highly specific emotionsso in that way when you're taking careof the big six when you're tending tothese six pillars on a regular basis andI should point out that we really wantto tend to those six pillars everysingle day or every single 24 hours wereally need to make those a regularinvestment to the extent that we canwhen we do that we create aneurochemical and a neural milu thatallows the brain to be in a betterpredictive state it allows the brain togive rise to a certain aex spelleda CS so affexthat lead to certain emotions being moreor less likely to occur put very simplywhen we're tending to those six pillarson a regular basis we feel better moregenerally and therefore the emotionsthat we tend to have under differentconditions even conditions of adifficult interaction with a cooworkeror with a family member tend to be morepositive than if we are not tending tothose six pillars now in some sensethat's sort of a duh statement forinstance if you're sleep deprived ifyou're not fed well like you haven'teaten in a few hours of course you'regoing to be more irritable you're goingto be more reactive you are going to bemore emotionally labile but sleep andnutrition are just two of those six corepillars when we talk about those corepillars and the necessity for tending tothem on a regular every 24-hour basiswhat we're really talking about iscreating a millu within our brain andnervous system that allows the nervoussystem to do what it does best and infact what its main job is to do which isto predict what's going to happen nextbecause as Lisa Feldman Barrett pointedout emotions are really contextdependent states that allow us tonavigate not just our presentcircumstances but they are our nervoussystem and brain's best guess about thecircumstances that we are soon going toencounter now I don't offer you all ofthat as kind of a a bunch of you knowTangled mess of nerd speak to confuseyou what I'm saying is that by tendingto those six core pillars you areshifting the likely aects that you willEXP exp erience and therefore the likelyemotions that you'll experience soyou're biasing your whole system towardsmore positive affect and more positiveemotions regardless of what your lifecircumstances happen to be and thestressors that you encounter and indeedyou also are including that six pillarof stress control so when thosestressors arrive you will be better ableto navigate them now this view ofemotion regulation of mood and mentalhealth is certainly not a novel conceptpeople have talked about thephysiological regulation of mood fromthe time of William James and evenearlier you know it's been along-standing question for instance ordebate in Psychology and philosophy youknow do we feel anxiety in our body andthen label it as anxiety or do we feelanxiety in our mind and then our bodyfollows that's been a long-standingdebate and frankly there's evidence onboth sides which leads me to theconclusion I think most neurobiologistsand psychologists to the conclusion thatthose things are interrelated in a waythat we can't really dissociate themcompletely at any level right when yourheart rate goes up and you startbreathing thing faster you know if Iwere to induce that state in you you'dprobably interpret that as feelinganxious in addition to that somethingcan make you anxious before your heartrate and breathing increases and thenyour heart rate and breathing increasesso no need to tease those apart but ifyou think about the brain in large partas a prediction machine and your brainas a metabolic regulator it's trying todecide which organs need resources howmuch resource can I dedicate to thinkingto creativity to enjoying socialinteraction to paying attention to whatsomebody else is is saying as opposed towhat's going on inside my body all ofthose major functions of the brain asthey relate to affect and emotions aregoing to be best supported that isbiased toward positive mood positiveaffect positive emotions and thereforepositive mental health outcomes whenwe're tending to those six pillars DrLisa feldin Barrett referred to thatwhole process as the brain regulating abrain body budget and she had beautifulanalogies for that budget and that'swhat led to the description of socialinteractions is either generatingsavings or being neutral or generating ataxed feeling literally taxing thatbrain body budget and I love thatconcept and it's one that you can keepin mind and indeed we can inject a lotof specificity into this whole processof improving mood and mental healththrough specific protocols if you simplyremember if you make a daily investmentin the six core pillars you are buildingup that brain body budget you will havemore energetic resources to spend onwhatever life circumstances come yourway now before we move into a discussionabout protocols for how to better"

            "text": "understand your life narrative toenhance your sense of self andconfidence and things of that theme Ibriefly want to mention that of coursethere are known tools out there in themedical community and psychologicalCommunity for improving mood and mentalhealth and while there are a variety oftools one of the main tools of thepsychiatrist is prescription drugs thatTarget specific neuromodulator systemsin the brain and body for instance SSRselective serotonin reuptake Inhibitorsor atypical anti-depressants that Targetthe dopamine and epinephrine system suchas well Butrin bryone or other types ofanti-depressants or for instancenowadays there's a lot of growingexcitement about clinical trials usingrelatively High dosages of psilocybinwhich by the way way closely mimics thechemical serotonin that's rightpsilocybin which is converted to salicinin the brain if you look at itchemically it looks very much likeserotonin although it has distincteffects from serotonin I talked aboutpsilocybin and what's being done interms of the clinical trials safetyconsiderations I talked about thepotential Hazard considerations andwhere the legality and all of that isgoing in that episode if you want tocheck that out but the reason I'm takinga moment to mention these drugs thingslike ssris prox lat talopramWellbutrin cybin and so on is that allof them Target specific neuromodulatorsystems in the brain and body and at thesame time it's fairly clear that mooddisorders such as major depression arenot necessarily deficits in things likeserotonin or dopamine they can be butmost often they are not so why are suchdrugs prescribed for mood disorders andfor mental health disorders well becauseif specific neuromodulators likeserotonin dopamine or epinephrine aredramatically increased aboveBaseline that affords the brain theability to rewire itself really the wayto think about ssris or atypicalanti-depressants or psilocybin for thetreatment of majordepression is really to think about themas chemical tools to open or accessneuroplasticity and that's why it's ohso important that those drugs becombined with talk therapy where peopleare actively working through the sourcesthe real life sources and the historicalsources maybe even the trauma basedsources of their depression and Imention this because you know there's alot of debate nowadays as to whether ornot you know these drugs are usefulwhether or not the side effect profilesjustify their use whether or not youknow they are applicable to Youngpopulations you know there's a lot ofdebate about this and certainly in thecase of the psychedelics there's a lot alot of debate because this is newlyemerging area and there's still not alot of data although it's starting toyou know increase over time but the keyPoint here is that all of these drugshave the potential to work in somepeople not others some people you knowthey simply don't work for and theycause more problems than solutions theysolve but they tend to work byincreasing the propensity forneuroplasticity by changing theneuromodulator milu in the brain andthis is an important point when thinkingabout tool tools for enhancing mood andmental health that when we think abouttools for enhancing mood and mentalhealth and next of course we are goingto talk about the tools that arespecifically designed to Target aspecific aspect of one's life story orconcept of self all of that is alwaysoperating on a backdrop of two thingsthat overall neurochemical millu andautonomic function that the six pillarsrelate to and support if we're tendingto those but any Improvement in mood andmental health that's it's going to besignificant it's going to be noticeableand it's going to be stable it's goingto be pervasive over time is going torequire that some degree of neuralplasticity some degree of neuralrewiring occur so I'm not bringing upthe topic of these particular drug toolsto say that they are the best way toimprove mood and mental health I'mcertainly not saying that they are butone way to potentially improve mood andmental health and if they are going towork they always work best when done inconcert with talk therapy because theyare opening the opportunity forneuroplastic icity but then thatneuroplasticity has to be directedtoward a particular endpoint there hasto be specific work that's being done bythe individual or ideally the individualwith an expert trained clinicallycertified therapist or psychologist orpsychiatrist in order to make sure thatthe neuroplastic changes that occur leadto long-standing improvements in moodand mental health over time indeed thedrugs that I just described wereoriginally designed as tools to to allowpeople to access changes within theirbrain that would then allow them toenhance mood and mental health but nothave to rely on the drugs themselves forimproved mood and mental health andalong those lines I'm sure some of youout there are thinking about thesupplement based or nutrition-basedapproaches to enhancing theseneuromodulators and indeed while theydon't have the same potency as thingslike well Butrin and ssris at increasingthings like dopamine and serotoninrespectively there is a growing numberof people out there that are relying onsay daily supplementation with anywherefrom 1 to three grams with of eltyrosine you know amino acid precursorto dopamine combined with often you know300 to 600 milligrams of alpha GPC as away to enhance dopamine andacetylcholine and to set the stage forelevated levels of neuroplasticity butit's very important to point out thatthe amino acid precursors to the variousneuromodulators like El tyrosine like Eltryptophan so El tyrosine precursor todopamine ELP toan precursor to serotoninand so on that those don't have the samedegree of potency that is ability toenhance those neuromodulators and so theextent to which they enrich thepossibility for neuroplasticity StillRemains somewhat obscure there haven'tbeen clinical trials on that yet atleast not clinical trials that I amaware of so I mention all of that stuffabout drugs whether or not it'spsychedelics or whether or not it'sprescription anti-depressants or whetheror not people are using a supplementbased amino acid based protocol forincreasing certain neurom modulators Ifeel was important to mention all ofthat because well first of all it'squite prominent out there certainly inthe case of prescriptionanti-depressants and there's growingprominence and use of relatively high dopsilocybin again always in done withsupport talk therapy this is done in thelegal setting I said legal not illegal alegal setting with a board certifiedtherapist this is being done onUniversity campuses within research laband of course I acknowledge that thereare people who are using these compoundsoutside the realm of the Universityclinical study environment so I mentionthese chemicals not because I'm pointingto them as the path to improved mood andmental health they can be but theyaren't always and as I mentioned beforethey can sometimes cause problems thatlead people to wish that they hadn'ttaken them or to decide to not take themany further a decision that absolutelyhas to be made with a healthc careprofessional who's well certified to dothat but I'm mentioning these toolsbecause I want to understand if theywork why they work and one key pointthat was really emphasized by Dr Paulkti who as I mentioned before is apsychiatrist so he uses pharmacology inhis practice although he uses othernon-pharmacologic tools as well is thatthese pharmacologic tools are never tobe viewed as the Beall endall ofenhancing mood and mental health theyare but one path to improving mood andmental health and indeed should beviewed as a path to getting people whoare otherwise unable to engage in thosesix core pillars those first principlesof mental health to be able to do thosethings on a regular basis and thenperhaps based on a discussion with theirclinician these people could come offthose pharmacologic agents maybe yesmaybe no it depends on the individual itdepends on the

emotions I think of them asemotions but they're not very specificthey're pretty broad bins we say sad ordepressed or super depressed or supersad anxious panic and we think of thatas Nuance but it's not very nuanced andLisa's laboratory and other Laboratorieshave explored two things first if peopleare asked to or encouraged to put moregranularity more specificity on whatthey're feeling then it seems that theirlevels of emotional processing arebetter overall how does that translateto emotions well it translates to betteroverall feelings of well-being when oneis placing more specificity on positiveemotions and the flip side is also trueso this is important to know if oneplaces more specificity on negativeemotions it also can enhance one's kindof experience of those negative emotionsnow that means that this is a two-sidedblade all right this isn't always a goodthing and if one is thinking aboutprotocols for improving mood and mentalhealth the data make very clear thatadding more specificity to our positiveemotion in terms of the language we usebut also just the depth with which weprocess and think about those positiveexperiences can be very beneficial forus so there are two studies that I'dlike to highlight that relate to thisthe first is entitled effectiveself-monitoring through experiencesampling On Emotion differentiation indepression and the second study isentitled emotional granularity increaseswith intensive ambulatory assessmentmethodological and individual factorsinfluence how much now each of thesestudies focus on something slightlydifferent the first study was mainlyfocused on people who have depressionand they were cued several if not manytimes per day to just think about andreport on their emotional state and thatwas done in order to get people to placemore granularity more specificity onwhat they're feeling but also simply totap into how they're feeling on a moreregular basis throughout the day thesecond study which is one that includedDr Lisa Felman bear as an author wasslightly different because it focused onnon- depressed individuals and it cuedthem to touch into their emotions moretimes per day and it also included somephysiological measurements and one inparticular that we're going to talkabout in some detail now I don't havetime to go into all the details of thesestudies I may do that in a futurepodcast episode but the key takeawaysare very important for all of us to knowwhich are first ofall the more often that you can askyourself you know what am I reallyfeeling right now how do I feel and andthis is so criticalthe more that you force yourself to notuse broad labels or simply veilancelabels veilance labels are good or okayor bad and instead understand that goodis not an emotion okay is not an emotionbad is not an emotion but rather sayingyou know I feel you know curious but alittle anxious if that happens to be thecase or I feel you know bored um but youknow also a little bit in positiveanticipation about what's going tohappen tomorrow things of that sortputting more nuance and specificity onyour emotions but also touching into orthinking about your own emotional statesmore times per day clearly has positiveoutcomes for mood and mental health andthe reasons for that are incrediblyinteresting and this is somethingeverybody should understand why would itbe that putting more specificity on whatwe're feeling so perhaps just in our ownheads like thinking okay how do I feelright now like if I were to do thatright now I'd say I feelenergized and happy I do I really enjoydoing what I'm doing so I wouldn't sayI'm like off the chart in awe or Elationbut I'm very happy and I feel energizedyou know earlier today I was feeling alittle bit fatigued and a little bitconfused because I was trying to sortout something and it wasn't making senseto me um so assessments like that whichcan be told to somebody else or that wejust hold internallydone repeatedly throughout the dayanywhere from three to six timesthroughout the day just periodicallypinging ourselves maybe you set an alarmor maybe you just decide to every oncein a while you know maybe every time youyou go into an elevator or every timeyou go up a flight of stairs you justask yourself yeah how do I feel rightnow and thinking about that for a momentand you don't have to write it downalthough I suppose you could it turnsout that just that practice can reallyenhance our so-called emotionalgranularity that can enhance ourpositive emotions and affect and inaddition it provides us a bettersensitivity to better understand thosenegative emotions which sounds like itmight be a bad thing but those negativeemotions have information in them rightthis is one thing that's often lost inthose broad categorizations of anxiousor sad or depressed and keep in mind ofcourse that some people are genuinelyclinically depressed and that needs tobe taken extremely seriously just likesome people are genuinely clinicallyanxious and that needs to be takenseriously but most of us when we throwout the words depressed angry sad we'renot using enough nuance and it doesn'treally apply to our internal States orthe circumstances that we're in and as aconsequence we suffer it's not justabout communicating our emotions wesuffer because the data say that themore Nuance the more emotionalgranularity that we have the richer isour experience of the positive aspectsof life and the more effectively we cannavigate the negative aspects of liferight again negative emotions perhapsisn't the best way to even describenegative emotions because that labelnegative implies that we should avoid itand in fact those negative emotionsprovide a lot of information aboutperhaps social interactions that weshould seek to avoid in the future andso on and so forth now one of the mostinteresting things about this whole"

            "text": "process of increasing emotionalgranularity and touching in severaltimes per day into how we feel somethingthat's completely zero cost takes just amoment to do that we can get much betterat over over time that was clearly seenin these studies that people get muchbetter at doing this it becomes morefasile for them very quickly is that itcorrelates with improvements inphysiological metrics that relate tooverall improvements in mood and mentalhealth and the specific physiologicalmetric that I'm referring to isso-called vagal tone some of you haveperhaps heard of the vagus nerve it'sthe tenth cranial nerve it's anextensive peripheral nerve that it goesout of the brain kind at the level ofthe the neck uh it's one of the cranialnerves that extends um to essentiallyall the organs of the body the heart thelungs Etc but it's a two-way street it'sa super highway of nerves out of thebrain and into the body and it's a superhighway of nerves back from the bodilyorgans to the brain and it's involved inregulating a lot of so-call autonomicfunction so how fast our heart rate ishow fast our breathing is rates ofdigestion and all of that weavestogether to create those things that wecall aect our internal States so withoutgoing into a ton of detail about theVagas nerve there's something that'scalled cardiac vagal control cardiacvagal control is the extent to whichthat vagus nerve can impact your heartrate and your overall feelings of calmor alertness now the simple way to thinkabout this is more commonly referred toas heart rate variability heart ratevariability is simply the distancebetween your heartbeats or rather thetime between your Heartbeats which weknow if those timings between yourheartbeats are somewhat variable that iscorrelated with positive physical andmental health outcomes one of the waysthat you can increase heart ratevariability is to get regularcardiovascular exercise as well as doingresistance exercise and no surprisegetting sufficient amounts of qualitysleep each night is also going to bevery beneficial for heart ratevariability now exercise and sleep ofcourse are wonderful but it turns outthat there's alsoa very rapid way to increase heart ratevariability by activating the vagalinnervation of the heart and the waythat the heart and some other circuitswithin the so-called brain stem interactand that's through something calledrespiratory sinus arhythmia respiratorysinus arhythmia can be summarized verysimply by saying when you inhale youspeed your heart rate up and when youexhale you slow your heart rate down andit's that exhale slowing your heart ratedown that's mediated by the vagus nervenow there's a more thorough descriptionof that which I'll just give you now andit's not that lengthy so here's how itgoes when you inhale your diaphragmactually moves down and as a consequenceyour heart actually gets a little biggerit has a little more space as aconsequence the fluid in your heartmoves a little more slowly per unitvolume and there's a neural signal tospeed the heart up conversely when youexhale the diaphragm moves up that meansthere's a little less space for theheart in the general area where it'ssitting so the heart gets a little bitsmaller a little more compact that meansthat the fluid in your heart is movingmore quickly through that smaller spaceand there's a neural signal mediated bythe Vagas to slow the heart down sothat's why inhal speed your heart up andexhales slow your heart down that is thebasis of so-called RSA or respiratorysinus arhythmia now what does any ofthat have to dowith the granularity of language that weplace on our emotions turns out there'sseveral studies showing that whenpeople place more descriptivegranularity on their emotions that iscorrelated with okay it's not causal butit's correlated with improvements inrespiratory sinus arhythmia which weknow correlate with improvements inheart rate variability indeed it's oneof the major bases for heart ratevariability which we know is correlatedwith not just positive physical healthoutcomes but positive mental healthoutcomes including lower levels ofanxiety improved sleep and overalllevels of mood this is a topic that I'mvery familiar with because last year mylaboratory at Stanford University Schoolof Medicine in collaboration with acolleague of mine Dr David Spiegel ourassociate chair of Psychiatry also atStanford University School of Medicinepublished a clinical trial and cellreports medicine showing that there's aparticular pattern of breathing thatpeople can do for just 5 minutes per daythat is effective in significantlyimproving various metrics related tomood and reducing anxiety and alsoimproving sleep although I should saythe protocol I'm about to describedidn't uniformly improve all of thosemetrics it had a bigger effect on someversus others I'll provide a link tothat study in the show note captions butif you're wondering what this protocolis that people did for 5 minutes a daythat allowed them to by the waypervasively improve their mood so itwasn't just their mood while they weredoing this five minute a day protocol itwas improvements in mood Around theClock essentially as well asimprovements in other physiologicalmetrics and other aspects of those sixcore pillars it was that physiologicalsigh that we talked about earlieralthough in this case we didn't havepeople do just one physiological sigh wehad people set aside five minutes perday so set a timer for 5 minutes theycould sit or lie down they could do itanytime of day and we just had themrepeat that physiological sigh for aduration of 5 minutes total so that theywould do two inhales through the noseand then a full exhale to lungs emptythrough the mouth then they would do itagain and then they would do it againand again until those five minutes werecompleted again the outcome of thatclinical trial was that that particularpattern of breathing which we calledcyclic physiological sighing for fiveminutes per day again done any time ofday had the most positive outcomes interms of improving mood and mentalhealth and autonomic function thosethings related to sleep and heart ratevariability so that's a very simple veryminimal time investment zero cost toolthat anyone can use that again improvesvarious metrics of physical health butalso improves metrics of mental healthand it ties right back in with what wasobserved in the work by Dr Lisa FeldmanBarrett exploring how putting more wordlabel emotional granularity on one'semotional states positively impact ourphysiological State and the fact thatthinking about our emotions morefrequently throughout the day anddeliberately putting more labelgranularity on those emotions frequentlythroughout the day is correlated withthis Improvement in respiratory sinusarhythmia and heart rate variability thefact that these things all relate to oneanother should not surprise us becauseindeed there's a previous paper this isa quite extensive review actually it's avery nice review it's one that Iencourage anyone who's interested inthese topics to explore especiallypsychologists who might have a interestin physiology or psychiatrists or simplypeople who are interested in mindbodystuff this is a review published in 2017in the journal biological psychologyentitled cardiac vagal control as amarker of emotion regulation in healthyadults a review and again it's a reallywonderful literature review of thepeer-reviewed primary research whichreally establishes that this thing vagaltone our ability to kind of put thebrakes on our autonomic nervous systemand slow our heart rate downdeliberately through our breathing andperhaps even just by stopping andreflecting on what our emotional statesare is really beneficial for our overallmood and mental health and I want tohighlight bold and underline that wordoverall because it's not just the casethat people experience elevated mood andmental health in the moments where theystop and go oh how am I feeling oh youknow am I feeling you know bored oragitated do I feel particularly excitedsure that can have some impact onphysiological metrics and mood andmental health but in all of thesestudies the outcome seems to be thatpeople's overall levels of mood andmental health are enhanced not justwhile they're thinking about theiremotions or doing this five minute a daycyclic sighing but Around the Clockwhich is really terrific because I thinkthat's what most all of us want which isimprove mood and mental health not justin the moments when we do a practice orin the few minutes afterwards but 24hours a day I suppose we might segmentout sleep during which you knowhopefully we're having great dreams asopposed to other kinds of dreams but thepoint is everyone I have to imaginewould like to feel better and haveelevated mood and mental health duringthe times when they're awake and indeedthese sorts of protocols have been shownto do that or so say the scientific datanow we are going to discuss the toolsfor enhancing mood and mental health"

            "text": "of course most all of us know our ownname rarely do we ever forget that namewe have some concept of where we're fromwho our parents are what our present andfuture goals might be where we'vesucceeded where we failed in life and onand on but the self-concept goes farbeyond that sort of CV list or ourbiography of self indeed theself-concept has a lot to do with ourself-confidence our feeling ings ofability both to overcome challenges butalso our ability to serve the world thatwe're in and our ability to changeourselves over time now of course thedegree to which somebody might haveconfidence or less confidence or thedegree to which somebody feels that theycan exert influence on their environmentand their goals is of course going tovary based on their personal history butas Dr kti explained even independent ofall that if one puts in some work tobetter understand their self-concept toto really get a clear picture ofoneself from that one can develop moreagency with which to pursue one'saspirations and to reach their goals andthe key concept here is one that'sparticularly powerful for both exploringand building up one's concept of selfand that's to consciously anddeliberately build a life narrative nowa simple way to do this that can be veryeffective is to create a series offolders or documents it could even be astack of papers I prefer to do this inelectronic form and I confess that evenbefore learning about this tool from DrKi I had initiated doing this toolstarting back in2015 and it's fairly straightforward butas I mentioned before it can be verypowerful and it simply consists ofbuilding out separate folders or piecesof paper and this could be doneelectronically or on real world paperwith paper and pen or paper and penciland essentially what you do is you'regoing to divide your life history intosome regular increments so for for methe way that I did this is I created afolder on my laptop that I actuallycalled lifetime so that's the title ofthe main folder and then within thatfolder I have a series of folders Eachof which spans a particular phase of mylife so 0 to 5 years of age 6 to 10years of age 11 to 15 years of age andso on and so forth now I'm 48 years oldso I have folders that extend to age 50currently although I will add foldersgoing forward very soon and the ideahere is that for each of those foldersyou're going to place a single worddocument into that folder and then onthat word document you're not going tojournal you're not going to do any sortof extensive writing rather You'resimply going to put down bullet pointswith titles it could be one or twosentences but typically it's just a fewwords describing some of the keyMilestone events that you remember fromthat particular phase of your life sojust for sake of example I'll read offsome of the things that are included inthe folders for my particular lifetimenarrative but of course this relates tomy lifetime narrative you should ofcourse put the milestones and key bulletpoints that relate to your lifetimenarrative but again just to give you asense of the sorts of things that madeit into this folder in my six years oldto 11 year-old folder um on thatdocument I put where I was living atthat time the city I was living theschool that I went to I put a couple ofteachers names uh teachers that had aparticular influence on me um aparticular summer camp experience umthat was not a traumatic experience bythe way it was a happy experience butfor me it turned out to be a verytransformative one and then there are acouple other things in there that arejust Recollections of childhood'sfriends names okay so seemingly mundaneinformation perhaps but it looks more orless like a biography and yet otherfolders so for instance uh the folderthat spans from 25 to 30 years of age isthe time that I was in graduate schoolso it includes a note about graduateschool a note about particular hobbiesthat I was interested in in addition tomy scientific search at the time acouple of key relationships a couple ofkey relationship challenges as well assome things that at that time I wasprocessing about prior years inparticular my teen years in high schoolnow the key thing here is that whatevergoes into these folders is what'simportant to you it could be positiveevents it could be negative events itcould be events that for whatever reasonyou remember and keep surfacing in yourmind that you think might be interestingor important at some later time or thatyou're concerned you might forget infact that might be a really good me forwhether or not you include something inthese folders or not if there'ssomething that you want to make surethat you never forget but that you thinkyou might forget I would encourage youto put it onto that word document andput it into that particular folder againthis isn't about creating a coherentlife story this is about creating aseries of segments of small collectionsof key life events positive negativeneutral inspiring basically anythingthat was Salient for you at thatparticular time and of course if youwant to put Reflections about thoseparticular events into that worddocument you're more than welcome to dothat but the basis of this self-conceptdeveloping exercise is just that it's todevelop a historical sense of yourselfof course bringing you up to present daywhere you will continue to add things towhatever Word document goes into thatparticular folder for the age you happento be now now for some of you this kindof autobiographical bullet pointingmight seem like it's just that someattempt to build or write anautobiography but it's very important toremember that these folders are for youthese folders are not about writing abook about your life history although ifyou decide to do that with these foldersat some point down the line you knowthat sounds great but that's not thegoal here the goal is for you to build astructured narrative representation ofevents that were key in your life and asdescribed in the series with Dr kti thisgoes Way Beyond just understanding yourpast this is really about understandingpast it's about understanding yourselfat present and indeed it threads intoyour goals and aspirations for thefuture an important thing to understandabout this tool or protocol is that italso has a incredible ability to Anchoryou in your perception of the passage oftime you know some of us track thepassage of time better than others bothwithin the day and across days and yearsand so forth but this exercise inparticular is very good at allowing youto see you know how much time youdevoted at a given stage of your life toa given Endeavor whether or not you'restuck in patterns whereby you're stillengaging in certain types of thingsprofessionally or relationship wise orin any other number of different waysthat have you in a pattern that may ormay not be serving you well I want toemphasize again that this exercise isnot about goal setting it's about yourability to build a structured narrativepattern from which you can look at itand then make a determination as towhether or not you know you feel thatyou're currently on the right path foryou but it's not about projectingforward as to what your goals are we'llsoon talk about that we'll talk aboutgoals and aspirations in a moment thisis really about better understandingwhat led you up to the place that youare now and it really helps you pinpointthe keyw work that you need to do interms of exploring your unconscious andconscious mind using some tools thatwe're going to get into subsequently sothere's really no strict rules about howto do this exactly except that I doencourage you to make those incrementsacross your lifespan manageable Iwouldn't suggest doing it one for everyyear I wouldn't suggest a folder one forevery 10 years I think a 3 to 5 yearincrements seem like a more reasonableand tractable way to go about this sothat's one of the sorts of tools that DrKi referred to as to how to build up"

of coursethat practice is mainly a consciousexercise it's it's really not tappingdirectly into the unconscious in anykind of direct way as far as we know nowwe can contrast that with the tools andprotocols that are designed to tap intothe unconscious mind and of course thereare a number of different ways to dothis that were discussed in that fourepisode series with Dr Ki but one of themost powerful ways to do this is bythinking about and indeed sometimeswriting about or even analyzing one'sdreams now dream analysis is somethingfor which you can find a lot of booksout there there are a lot of theoriesthere's also a lot of AR arent thatperhaps dream analysis which has rootsin fraudi and psychology as well asother Traditions is perhaps not accurateI don't think we want to considerwhether or not dream analysis isaccurate rather I think we should justacknowledge that when we are dreaming inparticular the dreams that we havetoward the later part of our night whichare the dreams associated with rapid eyemovement sleep that tend to be veryemotionally Laden dreams as compared tothe dreams that we have earlier in thenight well when we consider the contentof those dreams even even if we're nottrying to interpret them it's very clearthat those dreams reflect theunconscious mind controlling more of ourinternal dialogue or what we areexperiencing at that time whereas whenwe are awake our conscious mind tends totake over more of the narrative theinternal narrative and the control ofour feelings thoughts and behaviors butas I mentioned before the unconsciousmind is always exerting an influenceregardless of whether or not we aresleep or awake with that said one way toexplore the unconscious mind and tobegin to get a better understand abouthow it might be influencing our wakingStates and behaviors is to actuallyrecord and think about one's dreams nowof course some people remember theirdreams on a regular basis other peopledon't some people actually believe thatthey don't dream studies out of sleepLaboratories at Stanford University ofPennsylvania Harvard and elsewhere allgenerally agree that everybody dreamsbut not everybody remembers their dreamsso if you're interested in tapping intoan understanding of what your dreams aretelling you which is basically a way ofsaying what your unconscious mind ordialogue consists of I highly recommendputting a journal so this would be anykind of paper and pen or paper andpencil type journal and the idea is thisif you wake up and you can remember yourdream write down a few key bullet pointsfrom that dream if you feel you canwrite out the dream in a very kind oflinear narrative this happened then thathappened then this happened then thathappened great but most most people findthat their memory of their dream israther fragmentary other people can'tremember their dream or at least theywake up they feel like they were havinga dream but they can't remember all ofit or key components of it and for thatI suggest that you try keeping your bodycompletely still and closing your eyesonce again we don't quite understand whythis is but when you look at theliterature on dream recollection itseems that by keeping one's bodycompletely still with eyes closed wehave better access to whatever thecontents of the dream that just occurredwere okay so if you wake up and youcan't remember your dreams try lyingstill for a few minutes and keeping youreyes closed and seeing whether or notthat helps surface the content of thatdream other people find that they get upthey get out of bed and then sometime inthe middle of the morning maybe evenlater in the day the contents of a dreamwill just come to them well if thathappens great I also highly recommendthat you have a way to write down thecontents of the of that dream now whatyou're looking for when you do this sortof tool or protocol I encourage you tobe wary of any immediate interpretationof for instance okay animals in a dreammean children although they could youknow there's not a lot of science thatreally supports that as a firm statementand of course there are books out thereand podcasts and a ton of informationtrying to help you interpret your dreamsand while some of that can be fun andnot all of it is entirely useless thegoal here is not to interpret yourdreams the goal here is to startrecording some of the key takeawaysMaybe maybe even the entire Narrative ofthe dreams that you have just prior towaking as a way to try and understandsome of the themes that are occurringand recurring in the dialogue thatexists within your unconscious mind so akey aspect of this tool is that you'renot going to take any one dream as anenormously informative dream it might bebut more important in this particulartool is to write down the themes of aparticular dream and then see whether ornot those particular themes resurfaceagain and again across different nightsor across different dreams the idea hereis that things that are repeatingthematically will show up as differentcomponents in different dreams but thatby keeping a dream journal you can startto identify some of these patterns thatare occurring from one dream to the nextas opposed to having the same dream overand over but the point here is that youcan explore the contents and the themesthat's really the most important wordhere the themes of your unconscious mindthat is a occurring if you startthinking about what's recurring duringyour dreams because dreams are a timewhen your unconscious mind is dominatingThe Narrative within your mind and brainnow for those of you that dream a lotand remember your dreams as well as forthose of you that do not I would alsoencourage you to explore the contents ofyour thinking that is thinking aboutyour thinking during so-called LialStates and the Lial State during whichthis can be particularly useful is Rightupon waking so this is different thanthinking about what you were dreamingabout this is about keeping your eyesclosed and body still we do think thatthat's important for doing this wellbecause once you start moving your bodyyou open your eyes and you startbringing in sensory experience for thatday your mind dramatically shiftstowards conscious processing but in thatLial State between sleeping and awakewhen you wake up and you're a littlesleepy maybe you don't want to get outof bed this happens to me all too oftentry closing your eyes and remainingperfectly still for maybe one to threeminutes maybe five minutes and just payattention to where your mind goes nowyou might fall back asleep be mindful ofthat depending on what you need to dothat morning but a lot of people willfind that their mind goes into thisplace that's neither sleep nor awakeright this is a state that very muchresembles the state people achieve inthings like Yoga Nidra yoga sleep or innon-sleep deep rest although it tends tobe more dominated by the unconsciousmind a little bit more sleep-like nowsome people find this practice to bedifficult because they're the sort ofpeople that wake up and they're justimmediately ready to go most peoplehowever myself included find that whenthey wake up you know the mind isn'tcompletely alert yet and you can usethat period again just maybe two orthree minutes maybe five minutes tostart to pay attention to the contentsof your thinking see whether or not yourthinking migrates from you knowsomething related to work or torelationship or to self or to somethingyou want to do or something that you'reanxious about and so on and so on andhere too you'll want to write this downso this is very much like the dreamjournaling we just talked about but it'sslightly easier for most people toaccess especially people who have a hardtime remembering their dreams and againit's an opportunity to access some ofthe contents of your unconscious mind tolearn to look at and see what's going onin your unconscious mind in a way that'svery difficult if not impossible to dounless you're working with somebodywho's very good at accessingunconscious such as a skilledpsychiatrist or psychoanalyst and inthat way allowing you to dointrospective work which is notstructured in terms of thinking tryingto think about like what do I wantwhat's going on you know why did they dothat why did I react that way nothinglike that you're simply observing yourmind and seeing what's geysering up fromthe unconscious that is you're getting aportal into that portion of the icebergthat resides below the surface of thewater the next set of tools forexploring the selfself-concept Etc from that four episode"

            "text": "series with Dr Ki is journaling I'mgoing to do an entire episode of Thehubman Lab podcast about journaling andthere are a lot of different kinds ofjournaling and fortunately there are alot of great peer-reviewed studies aboutthe power of journaling for processingall sorts of things like emotionalstates trauma Etc they're basically twocategories of journaling that are veryuseful to carry out on a consistentbasis and when I say consistent basisthat could mean every day or it couldmean three times a week it could even beonce a week there really no hard andfast rules about this but when we thinkabout journaling there really two mainstyles of journaling one is going to befree associative journaling sometimespeople talk about this as a data dumpright typically people will talk aboutthe data dump as the morning notes whichis when you wake up in the morning youknow you got a lot on your mind youcan't organize your mind people who havea hard time structuring their thinkingand behavior often find this very usefulwhich is to you know take out a journalor a piece of paper again this is isjust for you it's important that yourealize and really make sure that you'rethe only person that's going to seethese notes because a lot of people getinto self-monitoring when they're doingtheir journaling they're thinking aboutwell how's this going to look is myhandwriting okay how's my punctuationwhat are people going to think is thisgoing to be a good book or not a goodbook listen none of this journaling thatwe're referring to is about your book oryour autobiography this is really justfor you this is an exploration ofyourself that's designed to help youenhance your concept that is yourunderstanding of self and indeedtranslates to better confidence betterunderstanding of your goals andaspirations better understanding of yourunhealthy patterns and defenses and onand on and so again the two styles ofjournaling are free association so whereyou literally just write down any thatcomes to mind or that you feel likewriting down within a given period oftime for most people 10 minutes is ampletime to do that for some people fivewill be enough and for some who have thetime maybe 30 30 minutes but for me andI think for most people out thereanywhere from 5 to 10 minutes of thisdata dump free association you know itcould be your anxieties what you'rethinking about what you're anxious aboutreally could be about anything thatcomes to mind and this free associationprocess can be very useful for clearingout the Clutter so to speak the otherstyle of journaling that's equallyuseful but for different reasons isstructure journaling to have a goal fora given entry on a given day and againthis could be done in the morningafternoon or night and the idea would bethat you would set an intention and byintention I mean a specific topic thatyou're going to restrict your writing toand that writing should be about self inparticular goals and aspirations whatyou've wanted in the past yes but alsowhat you want at present what you mightwant in the future for yourself thesecould of course be material things butin general this is more aboutaspirations of things that you wouldlike like to accomplish or generate andthe key word there is generate and ifyou listen to the four episode serieswith Dr kti he talked about three drivesthat exist in all of us these threedrives are the aggressive Drive thepleasure drive and the generative driveand we don't need to go into a lengthydescription about these drives right nowif you're curious about them and whatthey represent and uh how they can be inbalance or out of balance and how thatserves us or doesn't serve us pleasecheck out that four episode series withDr because he goes into that in a fairamount of detail and also in anactionable way but the key thing here isthat we're generative you know one ofthe things that I asked Dr kti at theoutset and throughout the entire serieswas you know what is mental health youknow we talk about physical health andwe have some idea of what thatrepresents you know healthy bloodpressure the ability to do certain formsof physical movement cognitive abilitiesyou know I asked him how can we Definemental health and his answer was verystraightforward and very powerful hesaid said what we all need to Aspire tois to be in states that is in the verbactions of agency and gratitude for asmuch of our Waking Life as possible nowthat sounds great right a sense ofagency the ability to exert influenceover our internal State and affect theworld around us in positive wayspositive relationships reach our goalsas well as gratitude being grateful forthe opportunities that we've beenafforded even grateful perhaps for someof the challenges that we've beenafforded or that uh were selected for usthat we had no control overand carrying that agency and gratitudeforward because it gives rise to a senseof Peace contentment and Delight so allof that sounds wonderful right be inagency and gratitude as a verb Statesexperience peace contentment and Delightbut Dr kti acknowledged and we spent agood amount of time discussing the factthat doesn't happen just because wedecide we want to in fact agency andgratitude peace contentment and Delightgeyser up from a whole set of otherprocesses that we have to engage in on aregular basis and that really gets usback to those three drives he talkedabout how people tend to have more orless aggressive drive not justaggression in terms of violence althoughsome people do have that but in terms oftheir determination and their sort ofLeaning into friction even seeking out afriction people are on a Continuum withrespect to the aggressive drive he alsotalked about the pleasure drive and thefact that people are on a Continuum ofthe desire for pleasure to either be ahedonist or somebody who really avoidspleasure and kind of restricts pleasurefrom oneself and again that these thingscan slide around depending on our lifecircumstances our age Etc but that it'svery important that we have a sense ofwhere we are on that Continuum of anaggressive drive and a pleasure driveand that and here's the most importantthing that our aggressive drive andpleasure Drive never outsize ourgenerative drive and that engaging ourgenerative Drive is really the Hallmarkof mental health that leads to thatsense of agency and gratitude peacecontentment and delight and he definedthe generative Drive in the followingway he said the generative Drive is ourdesire to create build and contribute tothe world in meaningful ways andappreciate the process to get there itis the core feature of our mental healthso if you want to learn more about thevarious drives and how they interact andhow to access more generative driveagain that's all contained in the fourepisode series with Dr Ki but taking usback to the tools and takeaways fromthat four episode series the process ofjournaling in free association mode orthe process of journaling in a consciousstructured way is really about trying toaccess the generative drive and to buildup that generative drive and one of thekey things about conscious journaling isthat it affords us the opportunity in away that's not going to be seen byanybody else to really think about whatour goals and aspirations are now youmight say you know I can't even thinkabout my goals and aspirations I don't Idon't know know what I want well that'sfine then you should Journal about thathowever most people have some sense ofwhat they would like but most people aresimply not comfortable with writingthose things out or even thinking aboutthem and if you reflect on that howcould it ever be that you would achievethose goals and aspirations if you'renot even feeling comfortable enough tothink about them or write about them andso the process of thinking about andwriting about your goals and aspirationsis perhaps one of the key first stepstowards being able to actualize thosegoals and aspirations and for somepeople this might be very easy to do youcan simply write down say I want to youknow be married by this age and I wantto you know make x amount of money and Iwant to live here or there and certainlythose sorts of goals and aspirations areperfectly valid for this type ofexercise but so are the sorts of goalsand aspirations that relate to feelingStates like yeah I would like to feelpart of a community I would like to feellike an active contributor to acommunity and then the essential thingis to really flesh out out the detailaround those goals and aspirations youknow what size Community uh where do yousee yourself fitting into this communityare you doing this alongside otherpeople or by yourself in other words toreally get comfortable thinking aboutwhat your goals and aspirations areagain completely from the perspective ofself and that you are going to be theonly person to see this particulardocument now I will be the first toadmit that the exercise that I justdescribed not the free associationjournaling but the structured journalingof goals and aspirations I and manypeople find to be difficult to initiatedifficult to initiate because thereseems to be a bit of internal anxietyand friction around doing it there seemsto be something that keeps many not allbut many people from feeling as if theyare even allowed to think about theirgoals and aspirations because manypeople default to well then you knowI'll just be disappointed because it'snot going to work out I don't want tothink about what I want because thenI'll just be more disappointed and thatparticular frame of mind was actuallydiscussed in the series with Dr Cony andhe convinced me and he's the expert thatthe opposite is actually true when weare able to overcome some of our anxietyand really think about in a dedicatedway what we would like to create forourselves in our lives both present andfuture and keeping in mind our events ofpast because we always carry that lifenarrative forward then we are in a farbetter place to actualize those goalsand aspirations and he explained avariety of reasons why that's the caseand his clinical observations and someof the are observations that reallysupport that statement so I highlyencourage you to think about embracing aprocess of journaling again you don'thave to do this every day the journalingand the dream analysis take a little bitmore time but they are oh so valuablefor better understanding one'sself-concept and they really threadforward into real everyday actions thatcan positively enrich your mood andmental health now any description ofscience-based tools for mood and mental"

            "text": "health would be incomplete withoutincluding some tools related toprocessing of traumasnow the processing of traumas issomething that especially in the case ofmajor traumas or repeated traumas reallyshould be carried out in concert with aexpert trained clinician that is apsychologist or psychiatrist who'strained in helping people work throughtraumas however even if you're workingwith somebody who's expert in processingtrauma there are specific tools that youcan use on your own to accelerate thatprocess and for people who are workingthrough what are sometimes called moreminor traumas these are sometimes calledBig tea big traumas and little te littletraumas however you know thatnomenclature doesn't take into accountthe fact that you know most of us canprobably tell what the big traumas arefor ourselves and for others butsometimes it's hard to tell whether ornot those small traumas the little teatraumas actually are big te traumas soyou know this is one of the majorreasons why working with a licensedprofessional is really going to beadvantageous and in many cases necessaryto work through trauma that said theself directed protocols for workingthrough trauma have a lot to do with howwe think about but more importantly attimes how we talk about those traumasand Dr Paul kti talked about this not somuch in the four episode series with usbut in a particular podcast episode thathe did with Dr Peter Atia who some ofyou are perhaps familiar with for hisincredible podcast the drive but alsofor his excellent book outlive whichdeals with health span and lifespan orlongevity now in that particularconversation with Dr Ki and Dr AA Dr ktiemphasized the fact that one of the waysthat we hold ourselves back and indeedcan exacerbate the negative consequencesof trauma are the ways in which wemodify our language to describe thosetraumas and what he said which is soimportant is that often times we don'tallow ourselves to use language that'sas big as is necessary to explain thattrauma and the impact of that thattrauma on us and on others in fact manypeople start to you know relegate theirlanguage to more passible in a givensentence or passible in a givenconversation now what we're not talkingabout here is the idea that okay youknow screaming at somebody else aboutyour trauma or using a lot offour-letter words is necessarily thebest way to process that trauma verballyhowever we are talking about allowingoneself either in spoken form or inwritten form to really allow themagnitude of a given trauma to beexpressed with a fair degree ofintensity and language that can captureat least some of what that traumarepresented for us or for others now asDr kti pointed out all too often we dothe opposite what ends up happening ispeople will experience some sort oftrauma either major or minor maybesingle or repeated trauma and ratherthan being comfortable talking about itrather than using language that capturesat least some of the magnitude of thattrauma for them people start to talkabout that trauma less frequently theystart to distract themselves to thinkabout other things instead of talkingabout or thinking about that trauma andwhat happens is that trauma Roots intoour unconscious mind and starts toimpact Us in negative ways now thosenegative ways include increases inanxiety disruptions in sleep in fact oneof the common ways in which traumamanifests in disruptions in sleep by wayof rooting our unconscious is thatpeople will wake up at 2:30 or 3:00 inthe morning let's just say after severalhours of being asleep and immediatelythey're thinking about that thing thathappened and they're upset about it theidea is that when we push those traumasdown when we don't talk about them withpeople that we trust when we don't havea way to consciously process thosetraumas using language that at leastpartially matches the magnitude of theimpact of those traumas for us well thenthose traumas impact our unconsciousmind in ways that lead our unconsciousmind to literally wake us up in themiddle of the night and remind us ofthat thing it's as if it's being thrownback in our face over and over alsosometimes traumas will root their waydown into our unconscious and then theywill resurface in the mode of compulsiveor obsessive thinking about that thingor perhaps other things again theunconscious mind has a interesting andcomplicated number of different waysthat it defends us the ways that it youknow can create denial distraction thatwe might get hyperfocused on work as away to not think about the trauma orhyper focused on some details in ourenvironment and just really trying tofocus on that because it's much easierto process and handle that than thesetraumas you know again the processing oftrauma is a whole landscape into itselfthat actually was um beautifullydescribed in terms of how it ariseswithin us and how to process traumas ina really structured way in a justfabulous book that was written by Dr Kicalled The Invisible epidemic how traumaworks and how we can heal from it and inthat book Dr Ki explains a number ofdifferent ways that we can doself-directed work as well as work withlicensed professionals to processtraumas and help us move through thosetraumas so that they are not negativelyimpacting us going forward so I reallyencourage anyone that's trying toprocess traumas from the past and orpresent to check out Dr kti's bookbecause it's a spectacular resource butin terms of the tools related toprocessing trauma that we're talkingabout right now I think this point aboutreally making sure that we allowourselves to verbally process andemotionally process that trauma in a waythat there's room for using languagethat captures some of the magnitude ofthat trauma and how it impacted us andothers is going to be very importantbecause otherwise what ends up happeningis that we tend to adopt feelings ofguilt and shame around those traumassimply by not talking about them byhaving them go Inward and then theystart to negatively impact ourunconscious mind and then ourunconscious mind tries to throw them upto the surface for our conscious mind torecognize by waking us up from sleep andin some cases by leveraging thoseunhealthy defenses things like denialthings like you know the overindulgencein alcohol overindulgence of drugs waysto distract ourselves as well asprojection and sublimation and the othertypes of defenses that Dr kti talkedabout in the four episode series againthose defenses are not necessarily goodor bad it depends on the circumstancesthe unconscious mind is not trying toharm us your unconscious mind is part ofyou it is you but of course it is youacting in concert with your consciousmind and so really the tools andprotocols from the four episode serieswith Dr Ki are aimed at helping you feeland access more sense of agency andgratitude on a regular basis more peacecontentment and delight and doing so bytouching into those different drivesunderstanding what they are theaggressive Drive the pleasure drive andreally making sure that your generativedrive again I love this description ofthe generative drive so much so that I'mgoing to read it again because this isreally what it means to be mentallyhealthy again the generative Drive isour desire to create build andcontribute to the world in a meaningfulway and appreciate the process to getthere it is the core feature of ourmental health so being able to accessthat generative drive on a regular basisis is really what this thing that wecall mental health is all about and thetools that I just described of coursecan be combined with in any number ofdifferent ways with the tools that Idescribed glean largely from the episodewith Dr Lisa Feldman Barrett and so whatyou now have is a kit of tools andprotocols for improving mood and mentalhealth some of which are grounded inthat core six the you know firstprinciples of self-care are always goingto be getting your physiology right so"

    "episode_summary": "In this episode, I provide science-based tools and protocols to improve mood and mental health. These tools represent key takeaways from several recently published research studies, as well as from former Huberman Lab guests Lisa Feldman Barrett, Ph.D., an expert in the science of emotions, and Paul Conti, M.D., a psychiatrist with vast clinical expertise in helping people overcome mental health challenges. I explain the first principles of self-care, which include the \u201cBig 6\u201d core pillars for mood and mental health. Those ensure our physiology is primed for our overall feelings of well-being. Then, I explain science-based tools to directly increase confidence, build a stronger concept of self, better understand our unconscious mind, manage stress and improve our emotional tone and processing. I also explain ways to better process negative emotions and traumas. This episode ought to be of interest to anyone wishing to improve their relationship with themselves and others, elevate their mood and mental health, and better contribute to the world in meaningful ways.\nFor show notes, including referenced articles and additional resources, please visit hubermanlab.com.\nThank you to our sponsors\nAG1: https://drinkag1.com/huberman\nPlunge:\u00a0https://plunge.com/huberman\nEight Sleep:\u00a0https://eightsleep.com/huberman\nWaking Up:\u00a0https://wakingup.com/huberman\nInsideTracker:\u00a0https://insidetracker.com/huberman\nMomentous: https://www.livemomentous.com/huberman"
