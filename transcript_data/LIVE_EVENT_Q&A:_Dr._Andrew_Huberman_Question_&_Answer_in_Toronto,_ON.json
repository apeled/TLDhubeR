            "text": "ANDREW HUBERMAN: Welcome\nto the Huberman Lab podcastwhere we discuss science\nand science-based toolsfor everyday life.ANDREW HUBERMAN:\nRecently, the Huberman Labhosted a live event at\nthe Meridian Theaterin Toronto, Ontario.The event consisted of a\nlecture entitled \"The Brain BodyContract\" followed by a\nquestion and answer session.We wanted to make sure that the\nquestion and answer session wasavailable to\neverybody regardlessof who could attend in person.I also want to\nmake sure to thankthe sponsors of that event,\nwhich were AG1 and Eight Sleep.Eight Sleep makes smart mattress\ncovers with cooling, heating,and sleep tracking capacity.One of the key things to\ngetting a great night's sleepis to make sure that the\ntemperature of your sleepingenvironment is correct.And that's because in order to\nfall and stay deeply asleep,your body temperature\nactually hasto drop by about one\nto three degrees.And in order to wake up feeling\nrefreshed and energized,your body temperature\nactually hasto increase by about\none to three degrees.With Eight Sleep, you can\nprogram the temperatureof your sleeping environment\nin the beginning, middle,and end of your night.It has a number of other\nfeatures like trackingthe amount of rapid eye\nmovement and slow wavesleep that you get,\nthings that areessential to really dialing\nin the perfect night'ssleep for you.I've been sleeping on\nan Eight Sleep mattresscover for well\nover two years now,and it has greatly\nimproved my sleep.I fall asleep far more quickly.I wake up far less often\nin the middle of the night,and I wake up feeling\nfar more refreshedthan I ever did prior to using\nan Eight Sleep mattress cover.If you'd like to\ntry Eight Sleep,you can go to\neightsleep.com/huberman to save$150 off their Pod 3 Cover.Eight Sleep currently\nships to the USA,Canada, UK, select countries\nin the EU, and Australia.Again, that's\neightsleep.com/huberman.AG1 is an all in one vitamin\nmineral probiotic drink.I've been taking AG1\nsince 2012, so I'mdelighted that they\nsponsored the live event.The reason I started taking\nAG1 and the reason I stilldrink AG1 once or\ntwice a day is that itprovides all of my\nfoundational nutritional needs.That is, it provides\ninsurance that Iget the proper amounts of those\nvitamins, minerals, probiotics,and fiber to ensure optimal\nmental health, physicalhealth, and performance.If you'd like to try AG1, you\ncan go to drinkag1.com/hubermanto claim a special offer.They're giving away five\nfree travel packs plusa year's supply\nof Vitamin D3+K2.Again, that's\ndrinkag1.com/huberman to claimthat special offer.And now without further ado,\nthe question and answer sessionfrom our live event\nat the MeridianTheater in Toronto, Ontario.OK.What motivated me to do the\nguest series with Paul Conti?"

            "text": "OK.So first of all, for those\nof you that don't know,Paul Conti is a psychiatrist.He's a Stanford and Harvard\ntrained psychiatrist,and I wanted to do the series\nwith Paul for several reasons,and we initiated that series.First of all, he's incredibly\ntalented as a clinician.And yet despite having written\nan excellent book about trauma,I felt that two things\nwere true for sure.One is that most people\nwon't get the opportunityto work with Paul, sadly.He's time limited.And second is that his expertise\nis incredibly vast not justrestricted to trauma.Traumas, if understood,\ncan be transmutedinto deep sources of knowledge\nthat other people canbenefit from.Indeed, what I found in\nPaul as I got to knowhim is that he has\njust profound insightinto the unconscious mind.And people had long asked me\nin and around the podcast,what about the subconscious?What about the unconscious?And I was of the mind\nthat the supercomputerof the human brain is the\nforebrain, the thinking,planning, context, setting\npiece right behind our forehead.It's the reason that\nwe're not the house cats.The house cats are\nthe house cats,and it's the reason we're\nthe curators of the planet.But Paul said, oh,\nno, no, no, no, no.No, no, no, no, no, no.The unconscious mind is the\nsupercomputer of the mind.I'm like, well,\nthat sounds great.But how do we understand\nthe unconscious mind?And he has a really\nbiological andpsychological and\npsychiatric understandingof the unconscious.And in that series, he talks\nabout these so-called cupboardsthat we can look into in\norder to better understandour unconscious mind\nin order to allowour unconscious mind to teach\nus things about ourselves thatare useful.And there are three main places\nwhere our unconscious teachesus useful things that allow us\nto be more conscious of the waythat our brain is\nworking in useful ways.The first is in\nthese liminal statesbetween waking and sleep.It really does\nseem to be the casethat when, surprise, surprise,\nwe're completely stilland we're emerging from or we're\ndropping into states of reducedautonomic arousal but our\nlevel of thought, if you will,is still active enough that\nwe are aware maybe evenlucid dreams and also in dreams,\nour unconscious mind uses,as I think Jung and Freud\npretty well understood,symbols to teach us things.But everything's\nflipped in there.Gender's flipped.Just because you're having\na conflict with somebodyin your life who's\na man doesn't meanthat person shows up as a man.They could show up as an\nanimal, so species are flipped.The symbols become\nmishmashed, but Paulmade it very clear\nthat all this canbe parsed if you do a certain\nkind of introspective work.And I thought that would\nmean a lot of talk therapy.How are we going to get\npeople to learn how to dotalk therapy by themselves?We want to keep things as much\nindependent of cost and thingslike that.And the practices he\nstarted talking aboutwere incredibly simple.Things like mirror work--some of the\npsychologists in the roomwill be familiar with this.I thought, mirror work?What is that?And he said, literally,\npeople tryingto access their unconscious in\nsleep by a practice of staringinto the mirror for some\nperiod of time while awakeand reflecting on\nself and aspirationsand the idea of the\nbody as a container.All this stuff, even for a\nkid from Northern California,sounds really, woo, new agey.But here, it's scripted by\nPaul into a formal structurethat one can use to parse\nyour own mental healthand enhance mental health.So that was the reason\nfor doing the series.And especially the episode\non relationships, not justromantic relationships,\nI found--hasn't come out yet.Incredibly\ninteresting, because hetalked about how in his\nclinical experience,virtually all the stuff\nthat people pay attentionto in relational stuff\nis, are they a narcissist?Are they obsessive?Is this person a musician\nversus whether or notI'm an accountant?Are we compatible?That none of that stuff predicts\nanything as well as the balanceof these three drives--the aggressive drive,\nthe pleasure drive,and the so-called\ngenerative drive.And I found it to\nbe fascinating,and I'm excited for that\nepisode and the other episodesto come out.But basically, because\nPaul is brilliant.And he makes what I consider\npretty obscure and opaquevery clear and\nconcrete, and thereare a bunch of worksheets--\nagain, all available at zerocost and none of them\nrequiring that you do therapywith anybody if\nyou choose not to.This is all the kind of work\nthat one could do on oneself.And the last thing I'll\nsay about this is--and I should have\nsaid this first--is that the primary motivation\nwas we did a series of Dr. AndyGalpin on physical fitness.Why isn't there a series\non mental fitness?What is that?Why do we talk so much\nabout mental health whenwe're-- and it's usually a\nconversation about mentalillness.People should have tools and\npractices that are zero cost,I believe, to be able to\nintrospect in a structured wayand enhance their mental\nhealth independentof their level of\nincome, and I thinkPaul was the guy to do it.And we'll do more of\nthat with other peopleas well because no single\nepisode about any topicor series can exhaustively\ncover any topic, although Lordknows we will try.OK.Next question.What are the recommended\nprotocols and best practicesto enhance emotional resilience\nand develop effective responses"

            "text": "during highly\ntriggering situation?You're asking the wrong guy.[LAUGHTER]I mean, I don't snap.I don't snap.I was a wild teenager,\nbut I don't snap.I'm not the aggressor, but\nI do have a snap button,and it's been pushed before.And I have to say\nwhen that happens,it's really kind\nof a scary thing.Not to me, right?And it's been many years.But I think anyone who's\nhit that threshold whereyou're trying not to say\nsomething, you say it anyway.That's usually how it\nshows up for people.I think we hear the statements.Be responsive, not reactive.That's why I became a\nbiologist because stufflike that makes no sense to me.In that moment, how are you\nresponsive, not reactive?So to me, it was like,\nwhat are the tools?Clearly, as you go up that\ncontinuum of autonomic arousal,it becomes much harder to do\nwhatever that means, right?Hence, the tools for\nreducing stress in real time.I think the one that\nwe haven't emphasizedso much on the podcast--and by the way, thanks to some\ngreat therapy that was notvoluntary, I was able to--I was a wild kid.I was a wild, wild kid.I hung around wild kids, and\nthings were pretty differentthen, and we worked it out.But I think nowadays,\nit's wonderfulbecause I think people are\nmore conscious of the needto understand their nervous\nsystem, their own psychology.That wasn't as common back then.In fact, I hid the fact\nthat I had to do therapyfor a long time, thinking, wow.Everyone's going\nto think I'm crazy.They did call me crazy.I think things have\nreally changed.I think the last 20\nyears have broughtabout a profound\nshift in the waythat we think about\nour own speciesand what our useful\ntools and practices.And I think that one of the\nthings that is abundantly clearis that threshold\nfor a stress responsereally is different\nfor different people,different in\ndifferent situations,but that it is something\nthat can be practicedand elevated in terms of not\ngetting near that trigger pointthrough the types of practices\nthat I talked about earlier.Getting more comfortable\nwith adrenalinecirculating in your system\nis what it's really about,frankly.But of course, it all starts\nwith a good night's sleep,right?It's going to make\nyou far less reactive.But of course, when\nyou're stressed,that's often when you're\nnot getting good sleep.So I think ultimately\nthat our ability to--as more emotional resilience\nand effective responsesduring triggering\nsituations is reallythe consequence of practices\nof taking good careoutside of those situations.And then of course,\ninevitably, therewill be situations where\npeople get triggered.And it's actually interesting to\nsee the way that people behaveonline and the fact that many\npeople, in fact, in scienceas well have literally lost\ntheir jobs for not beingable to control their thumbs.We're in an odd\ntime where there'sthe distancing of doing things\nonline as opposed to in personwhere people somehow engage in\nsaying things and doing thingsthat they wouldn't in person.But I think that ultimately it's\nthe consequence of good selfcare, and this\ngets actually backto some of the things that are\ncovered in the Conti series.We hear about self care.We think that means massages,\nwhich are great, by the way.And we think that is about\nexercise, and that's wonderful.But much of self care is\nabout really making surethat our nervous\nsystem is in the statethat we need it to be in\norder to go about our day.And I think this is why morning\nroutines and practices areso vital.I think that those set the stage\nfor the emotional resilience.Those set the stage for avoiding\ngetting triggered, so to speak.I don't think there's\na lot that onecan do in real time except\nperhaps physiological sighs.So sorry to give you a\nsort of empty answer.I'm not a pessimist\non this front.But I think that\nultimately, it'slike saying, well,\nwhat if you haveto scale the side of\na building to get inand you locked yourself out?What can you do to\nprepare for that?Well, you can buy a ladder.But if you don't have a ladder,\nwhat you probably should dois be physically fit\nenough to climb upa railing or something like\nthat and know how to picka lock or something like that.So I think ultimately that it's\nthe consequence of stuff that'sdone away from those\ntriggering situations.Next question, please.How would you describe the\nbrain activity of somebody"

            "text": "when they're suddenly\ninspired, and how do you fosterinspiration in your life?Well, I talked a\nlittle bit about this,but I will say that the best\nway to foster inspirationis in the words of the\ngreat Joe Strummer.They actually call it\nStrummer's law, no joke.No input, no output.I think one of the\nthings that I'veobserved over and over\nagain is that as muchas we need to dedicate ourselves\nto our craft, to our families,to our friends, that\nultimately our best ideas comefrom disparate\nexperiences when we're notseeking a particular kind\nof input to get ideas.Now, maybe, this\npractice of beingcompletely still while being\nalert fosters a lot of--I think the way I\nunderstand it ismore of a geysering up of stored\ninformation in the unconscious.That's how I think Rick\nwould talk about itor Paul Conti would talk\nabout it, as geysering upfrom the unconscious.Because when we are focused\non the outside world,we're taking in\nsensory information,exteroception as opposed\nto interoception.Of course, that external sensory\ninformation-- that no input,no output--is that those are\nthe raw materialsthat our nervous system uses to\nconstruct ideas about anything.So my belief-- and\nthis is a practiceI do every week is I make sure\nthat at least once a week Ieither walk or hike or\nrun without any earphones.And I'm trying to get into\nstates of wordlessness,states where I'm not\ndigesting a podcast,where I'm not reading a\nbook, where I'm not listeningto a lecture, where I'm\nnot in conversation,and essentially, trying to turn\noff the linguistic narrative.We are a storytelling species.We tend to take all of\nour internal and externalexperience and construct\nthings around language.But spoken language is not the\nlanguage of the nervous system.The language of\nthe nervous systemstill remains to be identified.It's something else.For people that think in\nfeels, it will certainlyincorporate that.Spoken language, of\ncourse, is important,and we have some core\nstructures to spoken language.We covered this in\nthe podcast episodewith my friend Eddie Chang.But ultimately the way\nto come up with new ideasor inspiration is going to be\nto collect the raw materialsof experience and then give\nourselves these periods,maybe even just\nfive, 10 minutes--you don't have to lay around\nhalf the day doing nothingstill wide awake--and give that those raw\nmaterials the opportunityto marinate and combine\nin whatever waysthat are unique to you\nand then to geyser up.What inspiration looks\nlike in the brain,we don't really know.There's awe.There are some studies about\nawe, but that's different.The word that better\ncomes to mind is delight.Awe in my mind is something\nthat we witness that sortof overwhelms our attention.Like, wow.Delight is when it\nsomehow links upwith our own internal narrative.Like, I have something to\ndo with what's happening.I'm not just here to witness it.A really impressive\nfireworks show is like awe,but there's nothing\nto do about it.It doesn't relate to\nanything about you, really.You're purely a spectator.Whereas delight is\nwhen you see somethingand it somehow\nlinks to somethingin your emotional or personal\nhistory or how you're wired,that now there's\nsomething to do about it.That's inspiration.And we don't understand where\nthat exists in the brainor what that looks\nlike, but I think we allrecognize that feeling\nwhen it happens,and it's oh so wonderful.OK.Next question, please.How can Canadians fight\nthe seasonal depression?"

            "text": "Winters are too long here.OK.Well, this gives\nme an opportunityto share with you\nwhat I think isone of the coolest\nthings about our species.Notice I say that\nabout many things.So we've talked about\ncircadian rhythms, right?Sunrises, sunsets.And we get that\ninformation transmittedinto our nervous system\nby looking at the sunrise.By the way, you\ndon't have to watchthe sun cross the horizon.It just needs to be low\nsolar angle, low in the sky.Once it's overhead,\nit's a different signal.So low solar angle,\nthat's what it's about.It's not necessarily\nabout seeingthe sun cross the horizon.By the way, someone the\nother day on my team said,won't you get cataracts\nif you look at the sun?Low solar angle sunlight is very\nunlikely to cause cataracts,especially if you're just\ndoing it 10 to 30 minutes.The sun overhead is\nwhen it's quite bright.Yes, indeed, some\npeople are goingto be at risk for cataracts.So ophthalmologists\nin the audiencecan attack me for that one.But it was our chair of\nophthalmology at Stanfordthat said it, so I'm\ngoing to trust him.OK.That's circadian,\n24 hour rhythms.But there's also these\ncircannual rhythms.So if you're at a\nfairly northern locationon the planet,\nnights get very long.Days get short in winter.What happens then?Well, melatonin, the\nhormone of darkness,is essentially\nobliterated by sunlight.So what's happening when\ndays are 12 hours long,you have very little melatonin,\nthe duration of the melatoninsignal is very short?Then as you proceed into the\nfall, days are getting shorter.Nights are getting longer.The duration of the\nmelatonin signalis getting longer and longer.Then, of course, in winter,\nthere's a lot more darkness.Melatonin signals are very long.Daylight signals are very short\nbecause the days are short.So you can say, OK.Well, that's obvious,\nthank goodness.But what that means\nis incredible.What that means is that you\nhave a hormone, melatonin,that's secreted from your pineal\ngland, which Descartes calledthe seat of the\nsoul because there'sonly one of them in the brain.I don't know how he\nup with that one.But the pineal\nsecretes melatonin,and you suppress\nmelatonin secretionwith sunlight viewing.There's a couple of synapses in\nbetween the eye and the pineal,but it gets there up\nthrough the neck, basically,the cervical ganglia.What's wild, therefore,\nis that the locationof the Earth around the sun\nand the tilt of the Earthis translated into a neural\nand then a hormonal signalin your brain, which\nto me is amazing.That literally means\nthat the positionof the Earth around\nthe sun and its tiltare translated into a\nphysiological signal that'sworking unconsciously to tell\nyour brain and body what timeof year it is.But it doesn't care\nwhat time of year it is.It cares about where you are\nin this orbit about the sun.So if you think about\nwhen days are, say,eight hours long in the\nfall versus eight hours longin the spring, what's different?What's different is how long\nthe signal was the day before.So the seasonal\ndepression we now knowis the consequence of the\nmelatonin signal gettinglonger, not an absolute duration\nof the melatonin signal.In other words, in the spring\nwhen a day is eight hours long,but yesterday, the day was\nseven hours and 48 minutes long,your brain has a memory\nof how much melatoninwas released the\nday before, muchmore than that particular day.So it's a slow\nintegrating clock.So this is a very\nroundabout way for meto teach you about the\nmelatonin seasonal rhythm cycleand answer the question\ndirectly by saying,if you want to offset\nseasonal depression,what you want to do is extend\nthe amount of bright lightthat you're getting\nin the morningslightly as days get shorter.But it's the extension of\nthe bright light exposure--and if you can't do that\nwith sunlight because there'sno sunlight because\nyou live in Toronto,not Toronto, what you want to do\nis find some artificial sourcethat you can look\nat in the morningbefore you leave your home.And I haven't talked much\nabout this on the podcastbecause our listeners\nare extended itaround the globe and not\njust in northern locations.But what this essentially\nmeans is getting maybetwo to three minutes of bright\nlight exposure as you'reheading from fall into winter--bright light from an\nartificial source.You do not need to\npurchase a so-called SADlamp, one of these very\nexpensive seasonal depressionlamps.What I did was I\npurchased-- because I'mvery sensitive to\nseasonal changes in lighteven though I don't\nlive very far north.You can get a 900\nlux drawing tablet.These are quite inexpensive.They're not zero cost,\nbut quite inexpensive.And just put that on\nyour desk or on whereveryou make your coffee in\nthe morning 90 minutesafter you wake up--this sort of thing.And just get five or so minutes\nbefore you leave the house.And then as you extend\ninto the winter,you don't have to be\nneurotic about increasingthe duration every day.Actually, the way these slow\nintegrating clocks work,you could actually even just\nhold it a little bit closereach day.Don't burn your eyeballs out--a little bit closer each day.But essentially, if you just\ndose yourself with a little bitmore bright light early in the\nday as you extend into winter,that will essentially\ntrick the melatonin systeminto thinking that you're\ngoing from eight hoursinto 10 hours of light\nas opposed to eight hoursinto six hours of light.OK?Very simple.And if you can't get one\nof these 900 lux tabletsor something off a\nwebsite, then youcould do this with any bright\nincandescent bulb should work.Again, just be careful\nnot to put it directlyagainst your eyeball.OK.Next question, please.How do you increase\nneuroplasticity?Well, this is an opportunity\nto talk about something"

            "text": "I should have said earlier,\nwhich is that ultimately,whether or not you are\ntriggering neuroplasticitythrough elevated focus\nor whether or not you'retaking high dose psilocybin--your business, not mine.And we can talk about\npsychedelics if you want--just decriminalized\nin Californiaor soon to be decriminalized.[CHEERS]Cool.People are enthusiastic.Yeah.I've been pretty\nvocal about my beliefthat the data are\nreally interesting,to say the least,\nabout not microdosing.By the way, there's\nnot a lot of evidencethat microdosing is useful.I'm not saying\nit's not, but therenot a lot of clinical\ntrials showing that.But the two macro dose with\neffective therapeutic supporttrials are very encouraging\nnot just for major depressionbut also for various\neating disorders,alcohol use disorder, which\nis, by the way, the termthat people are\nstarting to shiftto as opposed to alcoholism--alcohol use disorder.Which is not to be\npolitically correct,just so you understand\nwhat they'retalking about when they're\ntalking about alcohol usedisorder.Whether or not psilocybin,\nwhether or not it's MDMA,whether or not it's frustration\nbrought about by your inabilityto play an instrument and\nyour determination to do so,in the end, it's\nall about deploymentof these neuromodulators,\nneuromodulatorsbeing some combination\nof dopamine, serotonin,acetylcholine, or epinephrine,\nagain, usually in combination.What's very clear is that\nthe neuroplastic effectsof MDMA, the neuroplastic\neffects of psilocybinare brought about by huge\nincreases in serotonin.This also can help us\nunderstand why, for some years,and to some extent still\nnow, it was thoughtthat the SSRIs, the selective\nserotonin reuptake inhibitors,would be good treatments\nfor depression.I think some people,\nby the way, haveexperienced tremendous\nrelief from the SSRIs.We don't want to demonize them.At the same time,\nit's very clearthat depression is not simply\nlow levels of serotonin.That's also not true, hence\nwhy there's effective,in some people, antidepressants\nlike bupropion thatincrease dopamine and\nepinephrine and not serotonin.The point here is that these\nneuromodulators, as they'recalled, allow for what?They allow for modulation of\nsynapses, which effectivelyallows for neuroplasticity.I mean, ultimately\nwhether or notit's through talk therapy,\nKundalini breathing, high dosepsilocybin, MDMA,\nor the combination,which I think is\ncalled a hippy flip--[LAUGHTER]Never done them together.I confess.Never done them\ntogether, but havedone them with a\nclinician, by the way,in legal circumstances.And not a lot--not often, that is.It's very clear that it's\nopening windows for plasticity.Now, what's intriguing, if\nwe're going to just talkabout psychedelics\nfor a second, iswhy a drug like\nMDMA, which increasesdopamine-- which,\nby the way, MDMA ismethylenedioxymethamphetamine.Don't let anybody tell you\nit's something different.It's meth.It's meth.But it's meth with a lot of\nserotonin thrown in there, too.But it's meth.And it's clear that for\nthe treatment of PTSD,it holds promise.It's not absolutely\nsafe, especiallyfor people with\ncardiac conditions.If you're going to\ngo down that path,you want and need\na skilled guide,and this is where I\nthink the laws are reallygoing to have to pay\ncareful attention to whoand what is a skilled guide, OK?And when it comes to psilocybin,\nthe serotonin increaseis what effectively causes\nbroader connectivityin the brain.And what's interesting is\nthat both of those drugsincrease plasticity mainly\nthrough increases in serotoninbut working on very\ndifferent receptors.So they have different types\nand outputs of plasticity.What's interesting to\nme is that-- because I'ma strong believer that\nchildren should notbe doing psychedelics nor\nshould we be giving childrenpsychedelics-- is that the\nincreases in connectivityin the brain that are the\nconsequence of playinga musical instrument,\nor ideally,an instrument with\nothers as a child,mimic a lot of the broader\nscale connectivity, sortof so-called resting\nnetwork connectivity, thatoccurs when people take\npsychedelics as adults.In other words-- and I\ncan't emphasize this enough.And again, I failed\nat music miserably.I'll tell you a story\nabout that in a second.Getting kids to\nplay an instrument--it's very clear it\nimproves their abilityto learn all sorts of things\nfor their entire life.It's just so, so important.I don't really know\nwhat to do about thisor who to shout at or\ntalk to about keepingthe arts active in schools\nand physical education.But the idea that we would\njust train kids in mathis just frightening\nbecause if youwant them to be truly\ngood at math and science,you'd also have them\nplay instruments.By the way, when I was a\nkid, I played the violin.My parents made me.It was not the instrument.I wanted to play, and we\nhave only one picture.They taught me\nthe Suzuki method.You're supposed to learn by ear.And there's one picture,\nand all the other kidshave their bows up.And my bow is down, and I'm\nstanding here on the stage,and my fly is down.And literally, the\nneighbor's dog howled,and I quit after that concert.So I was traumatized by it.They showed me the picture.My sister teased\nme relentlessly.So neuroplasticity--\nfigure out your choice wayto increase a neuromodulator\nlike serotonin or epinephrine,acetylcholine, or dopamine.I honestly would not encourage\npharmacologic or psychedelicapproaches as your\nprimary entry point.I really don't.I think that there's a place for\nthat in certain circumstances,but that would not be\nthe primary entry point.Next question, please.What type of movement\nprotocol do you"

            "text": "OK.And then I think we're\nabout out of time.Yeah.So my morning meditation\nis not really a meditation,it's a perceptual exercise.And that perceptual\nexercise has a weird namebecause I gave it a weird name.And I didn't intend\nto sound mystical,and I don't want credit for it.But I call it space time\nbridging, but it's not that.To me, one of the most\ninteresting thingsabout the nervous\nsystem is our abilityto orient in different\ntime domains.This gets a little bit abstract.But we know from\nstates of high stressthat we start fine slicing time.We know this, right?The world becomes like\na slow motion videobecause frame rate\nhas increased.As a vision neuroscientist,\nI can tell youthat in my laboratory,\nwe were doing studieswith virtual reality\nwhere we can crank uppeople's level of\nstress by giving themcertain visual stimuli,\nand then their abilityto parse information is clearly\nincreasing in the time domain.They're fine slicing\nmuch in the same waythat when you look at a slow\nmotion video of somebodydunking a basketball or\nsomething of that sort,it's because the\nframe rate went up.So when we are in\nhigh alertness states,our frame rate increases.When we're very relaxed,\nour frame rate decreases.So if you're Rick\nRubin and you'relying there looking at\nthe sky, your frame rateis probably slower\nthan if you're hyperfocused on-- oh my goodness.Imagine a dreadful situation\nwhere somebody sends youa text message.Well, let's make it positive.Somebody is having a\nchild in your family.And you're like, is it healthy?Are mom and baby OK?Dot, dot, dot.I mean, seconds\nfeel like minutes.Minutes feel like hours because\nyou're fine slicing time.OK?And then mom and baby are fine.OK, great.Happy story ending.Great.So when we're very relaxed, we\ntend to bend time more broadly.Now, it's also true\nthat your visual systemand your perception of time\nare inextricably linkedsuch that if you close\nyour eyes and youfocus on your internal state,\nyou are fine slicing time.And the second\nhand, if you will,is more or less-- the\nmetronome, rather,is your breathing and\nyour heart rate combined.When you open your\neyes and you lookat something in your\nimmediate environment,when you move from so-called\ninteroception to exteroception,your perception of time\nshifts fairly dramatically,and you now perceive\ntime according to,believe it or not,\nthe speed of imagesmoving in your environment\nrelative to you.And then as you look out\nfurther on to, say, the horizon,you extend the time\ndomain even more.If you then imagine\nyourself in the whole globe,you extend your time\ndomain even more.So my morning\nmeditation, if you will--it's more of a\nperceptual exercise--is to step through these\ndifferent time domains,to close my eyes and focus on\nmy internal state, open my eyesand focus on something close by,\nlook a little bit further, looka bit further, think\nabout myself on the globe,the whole world moving.So you're really extending\nyour space domain,and then the time\ndomain expands with it.And this comes up when\nyou see these little memesof, anytime you're\nworried, just rememberyou're a little dot on a little\nblue spinning in the universe,this kind of thing.But you don't think that\nway when you're stressed.You're thinking,\nI'm the blue dot.You're the problem.Whatever.Or I want that.You're not thinking.So this perceptual\nexercise is a wayof training my nervous\nsystem to shift deliberatelybetween these\ndifferent time domains.And for me, it's been\nvery useful for improvingtask switching, something that,\nas you probably have noticed,I'm not very good at.I go into the trench.I don't leave the\ntrench very easily.So that's been very useful.And if you are interested\nin more detail,there's a wonderful book called\nThe Secret Pulse of Time.And there's a Hitchcock movie\nthat's discussed in that book.The movie is about\n75 minutes long.And during the\ncourse of that movie,the background actually\nincludes rising and settingof the sun and a bunch of\ndifferent speeds of movementand interplay between\nthe characters.And your perception at\nthe end of the movieis that a much, much\nlonger period of timeoccurred because unconsciously,\nyour brain was paying attentionto these circadian signals\nand these other signals.Absolutely fascinating\nwith Hitchcock.Not a huge Hitchcock\nfan, but after seeingthat, I was like, wow.That's genius.He captured this\nspace time thing.What you see out the window\nis in one time domain.In the room is a\ndifference time domain.I won't tell you who killed who.But it's very, very interesting.And so the point being that when\nyour visual system is up close,focusing on things up\nclose or internally,you're fine slicing.When you focus on\nthings further away,you're more broadly focusing\nand so on and so forth.So that's a morning\nmeditation I do--perceptual exercise.It only takes about\na minute or so.The other thing is that on the\nmonitors, they're flashing now.That was your last question.So I want to just say a\ncouple of things before we go."
