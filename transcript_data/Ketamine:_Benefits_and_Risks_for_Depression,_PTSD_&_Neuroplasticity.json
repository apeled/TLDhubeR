            "text": "viewed as a street drug that was bad badbad is now being prescribed widely andhas all this interest surrounding it andreally this has to do with ourunderstanding of what depression is andwhat depression isn't so I'd like tojust take one or two minutes and explainto you a little bit about the history ofdepression and its treatment what weobserve starting about the middle of thelast century so around 1950 but reallytaking off in the early 1980s and 90s isthe so-called monoamine hypothesis ofdepression monoamines as the namesuggests are synthesized from aminoacids that's a good way to remembermonoamines monoamines include thingslike serotonin dopamine andnorepinephrine although there are othermonoamines as wellmonoamines are neurotransmitters or morespecifically they are neuromodulatorsmeaning they change the activity ofneural circuits in the brain and bodythey can ramp up levels of activity inlots of different brain areas where theycan reduce the activity of neuralcircuits in lots of different brainareas as well as within the body rightyour gut has serotonin and needsserotonin dopamine also plays importantroles in the bodyetc etc the monoamine hypothesis ofdepression is really centered around theidea that it is deficiencies in thesemonoamines either serotonin or dopamineor norepinephrine or some combination ofthose that gives rise to depression nowin reality there is very little if anyevidence that there is a deficiency ofmonoamines in any form of depressionhowever it is very clear that drugs thatincrease certain monoamines so drugslike Prozac or Zoloft that increaseserotonin or drugs like bupren which isoften called Wellbutrin which is itscommercial name which increases dopamineand norepinephrine can often providerelief for certain symptoms ofdepression in some people however whatwe've learned over the last 30 or 40years is that drugs that are designed toincrease certain monoamines in order totreat depression only work in about 40percent of depressed people that takethem and they have a lot of side effectsnow some people are lucky enough thatthey can use a low enough dose orperhaps even a high enough dose thatgives them relief from their depressivesymptoms but does not give them sideeffects that make it so uncomfortablefor them to use that drug that theywould choose rather to not take thatdrug however a lot of people that do getdepression relief from things likeZoloft or Paxil or from buprone findthat the side effects which includethings like dry mouth although morecommonly reductions or increases inappetite or vast reductions in libido orchanges in their sleep patterns Etc thatthose side effects really make itimpossible or at least veryuncomfortable for them to take thosedrugs and of course there are the 60percent of depressed people who do notrespond to those drugs at all now I wantto be very clear things like ssristhings like Wellbutrin have helped atremendous number of people get relieffrom depressive symptoms and in manycases have warded off suicidality aswell however there are also a greatnumber of people who have experienced alot of side effects and problems fromthese drugs hence the desire to findother compounds that can treatdepression without creating similar sideeffect profiles and that ideally canprovide relief not just for 40 percentbut for all people suffering fromdepression so that's where ketamineenters the picture prior to the 1990sthey were mainly studied in neuroscienceand pharmacology Laboratories for theirabuse properties and for theiranesthetic properties so ketamine is adissociative anesthetic it's actuallyused to induce certain forms ofanesthesia for surgery it's not alwaysused but it's often used this issomething that if you've ever had asurgery you might want to ask youranesthesiologist about you know whatsorts of drugs are you giving me to gounder what sorts of drugs are youkeeping me to stay under and maybe evenwhat sorts of drugs are you giving me tobring me out of anesthesia because itturns out that when you go intoanesthesia your anesthesiologist israrely giving you just one drugtypically they're giving you one drug toyou know kill off a little bit ofanxiety and maybe eliminate a little bitof pain sometimes and then they'll giveyou another drug to drop you into adeeper plane of anesthesia and thennowadays there are sophisticated ways tomonitor your plane of anesthesia andtheir sophisticated ways to if necessaryget you out of a deep plane ofanesthesia if that plane of anesthesiais too deep when I talk about a plane ofanesthesia I'm just talking about goingfrom Full wakefulness to you know areduction in anxiety to falling asleepto a sleep to the point where even ifsomeone were to pinch your toe or yourarm like a really intense pinch that youwouldn't wake up from that okay soketamine has the property of being ananesthetic it kills the response to painand at certain doses it can bring youinto deep planes of anesthesia at lesserdosages it can take you into transitionpoints between awake and deeplyanesthetized and it's really thattransition point between awake anddeeply anesthetize which we are going tocall the dissociative State it's kind ofthis liminal State a little bit likedreaming it can have some dreamlikequalities to it that's the state thathas most often been sought after oremployed for the treatment of depressionsuicidality and PTSD which brings up areally important point which is thatwhen people use ketamine recreationallyit's not clear exactly what plane ofanesthesia or dissociation they areactually seeking and this is why we hearabout some of the desired effects ofketamine that are driving people to useit recreationally and while we also hearabout people having some unpleasant oreven very unpleasant or dangerousexperiences when using ketaminerecreationally because we're talkingabout a drug that has a lot of differenteffects depending on the dosages and aswe'll soon talk about individuals varytremendously in their response todifferent dosages of ketamine and thedelivery route for ketamine whether ornot it's delivered orally in the form ofa pill or put sublingually in what'scalled atroche that dissolves under thetongue or it's injected and then it'sinjected into the vein orintramuscularly Etc each of those canproduce very different effects in termsof this speed of onset of the drug andthe type of effects that it produces inthe brain and body so what happened inthe early 90s is that Laboratories that"

            "text": "were studying animal models what we callpre-clinical models of things likedepression and learning and memory andto some extent ketamine but mainlyfocusing on learning and memory anddepression made an interesting Discoverythere's a certain pre-clinical model ofdepression that's pretty common inLaboratories that involves taking a rator a mouse and putting it into a smallcontainer like it looks like a beaker ora jar sometimes it's a tray and it haswater in it and you might be surprisedto learn perhaps not that if you put arat or a mouse into water it will swimokay so it's treading water in order tokeep its head above water and not drownI realize for some of you this might bea bit of an aversive topic to hear aboutanimal research but this is one of thecommon preclinical models of depressionwhich is put a rat or a mouse into waterlet it swim and see at what point itgives up because what happens is if youput a rat or Mouse into water it willattempt to save its own life by swimmingbut at some point it will just give upand it will just start sinking and thenof course the researcher needs to rescuethe router Mouse put it back into itshome cage dry it off give it some foodEtc this preclinical model is called themodel of learn helplessness and it'sbecome a prominent pre-clinical model ofdepression because of course we can'task mice or rats if they are depressedor happy I suppose you can ask them butthey're not going to answer in any kindof meaningful way so we can only look attheir behavior in order to understandwhether or not they have a sense ofhappiness or a sense of depression andof course that's very hard to gauge inan animal model of any kind you couldmake guesses based on other behaviorslike are they grooming regularly arethey eating regularly you know thingsthat more or less parallel what we thinkof as health or lack of Health in ahuman who's happy or depressed but inthe context of trying to understanddepression in these pre-clinical animalmodels having a behavior that you canreally quantify carefully across a lotof different animals and conditions isreally beneficial so this thing ofputting a rat or Mouse into water andseeing how long it takes before theygive up to save their own life is calledthe model of learned helplessness andwhat it allowed researchers to do was totake routes and mice put them into watersee how long it took before they gave upand then to give them different drugs tosee whether or not any of those drugseither hastened sped up or prolonged theduration over which the animal wouldattempt to save its own life thisactually has some meaningful parallelsto human depression you know one of theHallmarks of depression is that peoplestop thinking positively about theirfuture depression of course can includea lot of other symptoms you know one ofthe most prominent symptoms ofdepression for instance is consistentlywaking up around 2 30 or 3 30 in themorning and not being able to fall backasleep again now keep in mindit is not the case that if you're wakingup at 2 30 or 3 30 in the morning andyou can't fall back asleep that you areabsolutely depressed that's simply notthe casebut that pattern of lack of sleep plussome other things like lack ofanticipation of a positive futureinability to imagine the future in anykind of meaningful or positive wayEtc are part of the key features of whatwe call a major depressive episode sothis pre-clinical model of learnedhelplessness allowed researchers to testa lot of different drugs and establishwhich drugs at which dosages allowedanimals to fight for their life longerwhen placed into water it's really thatsimple as a model but it revealed somevery interesting things at least one ofwhich is that when animals were injectedwith ketamine this dissociativeanesthetic but they were injected withdosages of ketamine that were below whatwould induce full anesthesia theseanimals would swim for their life for alot longer now to some extent that oughtto be surprising and in fact wassurprising to researchers becauseketamine is what's called an nmdareceptor blocker now when I say blockerI'm not getting into the details of whatspecific form of blocker it is but I dowant to mention that a blocker issometimes referred to as an antagonistwhereas something that promotes theactivity of a receptor is called anAgonist okay so if you can just rememberthat ketamine is an nmda receptorantagonist or blocker then you should befine for the rest of today'sconversation now I haven't told you whatnmda is nmda stands for n-methyl-daspartate and you do not need toremember that but the surprise forresearchers was that this drug ketamineis allowing animals to fight for theirlife for longer so it has this sort ofproperty of overcoming what we calllearned helplessness or a sense ofhelplessness AKA antidepressant effectsand we also know that it's an nmdareceptor antagonist or blocker andthat's perplexing because we also knowthat the nmda receptor is critical forchanging neural circuitry in the brainit's critical for neuroplasticity so putdifferently here's a drug that blocksthe receptor that's critical forneuroplasticity for changes in the brainand yet somehow it's allowing theseanimals to fight for their life longerit's somehow giving them more of a senseof hope at least that's the subjectiveinterpretation of what one observes whena mouse or rat is swimming for muchlonger when it would otherwise just giveup and sink to the bottom of the vesselnow in general there are two kinds ofscientists there are scientists thattake a look at a set of findings likethat and say oh here's a drug that'ssupposed to be terrible for us it's ananesthetic and it blocks nmda receptorsand nmda receptors are good forneuroplasticity and somehow it's alsoallowing these animals to swim longerand I would say one category ofscientists would just look at that andjust say wow that is a big ball ortangle of confused facts like how doesone even reconcile that right brainchange ought to be good and perhaps evenlie at the heart of our ability torecover from depression this is drugthat blocks neuroplasticity but somehowis relieving depression I'm going towalk away from that I'm going to work onsomething far simpler and then there'sthis other category of scientists whichthank goodness exists who looks at thatapparent contradiction of okay there's adrug which blocks plasticity plasticityis thought to be important for gettingover depression and yet the drug canprovide some relief from depression atleast in these preclinical animal modelsand they say hmm I like a good puzzleright the more complex the puzzle themore interesting and they start diggingin with pre-clinical studies and theystart talking to clinicians who aretreating patients for depression andlike I said thank goodness these sortsof scientists exist and thank goodnessthey did that because it turned out thatwhen clinicians tried ketamine indepressed patients as a means to relievedepression it had remarkable effects soit was about the year 2000 when thefirst sets of papers about

            "text": "use of ketamine for the treatment ofDepression started to emerge now we haveto remember the context in which all ofthis was happening you know in 2000drugs like Prozac and some of similarssris selective serotonin reuptakeInhibitors things like Wellbutrin werereally hitting the market in full forceand as we talked about earlier somepeople were getting relief some peoplewere getting relief with a lot of sideeffects and therefore deciding not totake those drugs and a lot of people themajority of people that were takingthose drugs were not getting relief sothere was a real urgent need to findother drugs for the treatment ofdepression and ketamine at least basedon its apparent profile of being adissociative anesthetic would seem likethe last drug that you'd want to use totreat depression right it dissociatespeople even hear about dissociation as asymptom of depression and yet whathappened was a small number verypioneering clinicians started to explorethe use of ketamine in the clinic forthe treatment of depression and inparticular for depression that did notrespond to any other treatment so therewas a real critical need to find othercompounds and a bit more motivation totest some of these let's call thematypical compounds for the treatment ofdepression so one of the first Landmarkpapers in the use of ketamine for thetreatment of depression is entitledantidepressant effects of ketamine indepressed patients this is a paper thatI've provided a link to in the show notecaptions it's a small study okay so itdoesn't involve many subjects at all itreally just has seven subjects all ofwhom had major depression and they didintravenous injections with half amilligram per kilogram of body weight ofketamine now that dosage half amilligram per kilogram of body weightturns out to be very important fortoday's discussion because it's going toserve as a reference point for laterdiscussions when we get into other modesof delivery of ketamine such as oralpill form ketamine or sublingualketamine and as it relates to thingslike the k-hole or the dissociativeState or the various effects thatketamine can have depending on thedosage and the delivery route meanwhilegoing back to this study what they foundis that when they injected patients withsevere depression with ketamine theeffects of ketamine took place withinminutes within 10 or 15 minutes and thatthey experienced a sort of peak euphoricState okay so they're not inducing deepanesthesia right at this dosage they'regetting people into a kind of euphoricdreamy semi-dissociative state thatoccurred within 15 minutes and reallypeaked about 45 minutes to an hour afterthey were injected with the drug andthat the total effects of the drug interms of euphoriawere effectively over by about two hoursor so and that time course of effectsmakes perfect sense if you look at saythe half-life of ketamine which is howlong it takes for half of the drug to beactive in the system Etc but what wasreally interesting about this study andothers like it is that the patientsexperienced relief from their depressionalmost immediately after taking the drugSo within minutes to hours and that itpersisted for several days after takingthe ketamine okay so the dissociativeeuphoric dreamlike effects of ketaminetake place very quickly they're veryvery Salient right the person basicallyis just lying there experiencing thiseuphoric dreamliked associative stateand they get some relief from theirdepression immediately and yet there'spersistent relief from that depressionwhich lasted at least three days outfrom the treatmentnow a key theme of today's discussion isgoing to be that the antidepressanteffects of ketamine appear to be fairlyshort-lived at least when one isexploring one or two treatments withketamine in other words the typicalContour is that people will takeketamine get this euphoric dreamlikedissociative effect come out of thatfeeling some immediate relief from theirdepression this is one of the thingsthat makes ketamine an incrediblyattractive drug for the treatment ofdepression especially depression thathasn't responded to other forms oftreatment which is that people getrelief very very quickly indeed the sameday that they initiate the treatmentnow this is especially important whenyou think about the fact that themonoamine hypothesis of depression whichdrove the discovery and development ofall these drugs like ssris Wellbutrinetc those drugs often can providesupport for people with depression againonly 40 of people get true relief fromtheir depression and again there aresome side effect issues or major sideeffect issues in some cases that have tobe dealt with but even the positiveeffects even under the best conditionsoftentimes those effects don't kick infor weeks or months after somebodyinitiates taking the drug now that mightnot seem like a long time to wait forsome of you but if you are somebodysuffering from depression even anotherday even another hour with depressionseems almost unmanageable and sadly manypeople who have these forms ofdepression will go on to commit suicideso it is ever so important that there berapid treatments for depression evensame day treatments for depression andbased on the study it appeared thatketamine was and indeed Still Remainsthat drugnow I certainly don't want to positionketamine in your mind as a miracle drugfor depression in fact I don't actuallybelieve in Miracle drugs I don't thinkthat there is any compound that alonecan produce all the desired effects thatone wants without any negative effectsin a way that could warrant calling it amiracle drug that's just not how biologyworks there's always an interplaybetween pharmacology between ourbehaviors and what we choose to do ornot do this is a topic we'll get into alittle bit later when we talk aboutanti-depressive behaviors and the roleof ketamine in bringing aboutanti-depressive behaviors for the reliefof depression now with that said thestudy that I just mentioned as well asmany many other studies that followedemphasize that ketamine could providesignificant decreases in not justdepression and suicidality but also thefeelings of helplessness andworthlessness that are associated withmajor depression and again it could dothat in people that also were notresponding to other forms of depressiontreatment such as

we'renormally thinking about or referring towhen we talk about depression butketamine has also been shown to beeffective in treating bipolar depressionsometimes called bipolar disorderalthough more commonly nowadays calledbipolar depression I did an entireepisode by the way on bipolar depressionif you want to know what it is and whatit isn't how it differs from borderlinepersonality disorder Etc you can go tohubermanlab.com just put into the searchfunction bipolar and it will take you tothat episode ketamine has also beenshown to be useful for the treatment ofPTSD and for OCD obsessive-compulsivedisorder and for anxiety and for variousforms of substance addiction so ketamineis not a miracle drug but it does seemto have broad application and to be verysuccessful for the treatment of a lot ofmajor psychiatric challenges now justbecause ketamine has shown theseincredible applications it also has someserious problems that are directlyrelated to how it works in the brain orat least from what we understand of howit works in the brain what I'm referringto here is yes ketamine is very rapidacting it can often provide relief fromdepression almost immediately meaningsame dayhowever it is very short-lived afterabout three days or a week or so theantidepressant effects of ketamine oftenwear offso that creates a situation where peopleperhaps need to take ketamine every weekand yet it creates enough of adissociative State meaning it takespeople enough out of their normal dailyroutine that the prospect of peopletaking ketamine every week is actuallynot that feasible and also because ofsome of the propensity for ketamine tobecome a drug of abuse that is for it tobe habit-forming and or addictingone also worries that if people aredoing ketamine every week to treat theirdepression that they can becomeso-called hooked on ketamine nowfortunately there have been studies ofketamine and how it works not just inthe short term but in the longer termthat have led to some very importantclinical studies that have explored forinstance people taking ketamine twiceper week for a duration of three weekstotaland what they find is that yes after thefirst time they take it they get somerelief from depression they take it asecond time that week they get somerelief from depression and they do thesame thing the next week and the nextweek and when they do that they getrelief from depression the whole waythrough that entire three weeksbut it turns out that there's also someso-called durability to the effect suchthat if people do this twice a weekdosing regimen so ketamine twice a weekfor three weeks total they find thatwhen they end that three weeks they getsome ongoing relief from theirdepressive symptoms which can extendmonths or more before they have torepeat that twice a week for three weeksregimen now certainly not all studies ofusing ketamine for the treatment ofdepression have used that exact dosageregimen twice a week for three weeksthen take some time off repeat twice aweek for three weeks take some time offrepeat some have explored givingketamine once per week or even threetimes per week or doing it once a weekfor five weeks and then taking anextended period of time off beforerepeating the treatment schedule thereare a bunch of different studies outthere but when one looks at all of thosestudies and mass together it's veryclear that ketamine is providing relieffrom depressive symptoms immediately andin the days after the treatment but thatwhen those treatments are act fairlyclosely together that there is somedurability some ongoing relief fromdepression and what this tells us isvery important in fact I hope everybodyreally highlight this in their minds asthey're hearing it it's very likely thatketamine is acting by at least two andprobably three different mechanisms inorder to provide relief from depressionone of those mechanisms induces relieffrom depression very quickly and seemsto be associated with that euphoricdissociative dreamlike state that oneexperiences when they are under theinfluence of ketamine the secondmechanism seems to provide relief fromdepression in the days and weeks thatfollow the ketamine treatment and therealso appears to be a third mechanism bywhich ketamine can induce long lastingchanges in the nervous system and it isthose three mechanisms short medium andlong-term mechanisms that produce thekinds of changes in neurochemistry andmore importantly changes in actualneural circuit wiring that allowsketamine to provide this incrediblerelief from depression so next we'regoing to turn to what those mechanismsare because in understanding thosemechanisms you will understand howketamine provides this relief fromdepression but you'll also come tounderstand the more important broadertheme of what depression is really allabout at a neural circuit level and howrelief from depression is all aboutneuroplasticityas many of you know I've been taking ag1"

            "text": "already established that ketamine blocksthe nmda receptor and that the nmdareceptor is critical for many forms notall but many forms of neuroplasticitynow I realize some of you might befamiliar with so-called ligands andreceptors but most of you probably arenot a ligand is a chemical that binds toa receptor and a receptor is like alittle parking spot on the outside of acell there can also be receptors insideof cells but most of the time when we'retalking about nerve cells neurons andyou hear the word receptors you'rehearing about receptors on the outsideof the cellso the nmda receptor does not exist inour neurons in order to bind ketamineit's there actually to bind all sorts ofother things that are endogenous thatare naturally made by us but ketaminehas a very high what's called Affinityit has a very high probability ofbinding to the nmda receptor if it'sintroduced to our bloodstream so whenketamine is taken in pill formsublingual form meaning under the tonguewhen it's injected into the muscle orthe vein it gets into the bloodstreamand then it's able to cross easilyacross the blood-brain barrier theso-called BBB blood-brain barrier theblood-brain barrier keeps a lot ofthings out of the brain but ketamine canvery readily pass across the blood-brainbarrier once it's in the brain it has avery high affinity for meaning it knowshow to seek out and bind to those nmdareceptors now the simplest way toexplain how nmda receptors ordinarilycontribute to neuroplasticity is thatthey represent what's called an and gateand an and gate as the name suggests isa function in a cell or in a systemwhere two things have to be present infact for those of you that have a bit ofan engineering or computer programmingbackground you'll be familiar with andgates for those of you that don't don'tworry about it I'm going to explain whatan and gate is right now an and gate inthe context of nervous system functionis when two things are present likechemical a and chemical B both have tobe present in order for some process sayneuroplasticity to occur the nmdareceptor as I mentioned earlier is areceptor on the surface of neurons andit binds glutamate which is a moleculethat we all make in our brain and itactivates other neurons it's what'scalled an excitatory neurotransmitternow there are lots of differentreceptors for glutamate and thosereceptors are binding glutamate all thetime however in order to activate thenmda receptor there has to be a lot ofglutamate present and it has to happenover a very brief period of time so thenmda receptor is an and gate in thesense that glutamate has to be presentand to bind it and it has to get a lotof electrical activity a lot of input inorder for that to happen so it's areceptor that responds primarily tounusually high or frequent levels ofelectrical activity let's place this inreal world context so that it makes abit more sense I like most all of youand moving my arms around a lotthroughout the day now as an adult mymotor cortex the area of my brain thatcontrols motor coordination of my limbshas connections from my brain to myspinal cord from my spinal cord to mymuscles and that's what allows me tomove my limbsunder conditions of just moving my limbsand doing things throughout the daydrinking a cup of coffee or yerba mateyou know walking outside to view somesunlight in the morning doing the thingsthat I do every single day and that Ialready know how to doglutamate is definitely involved in thatprocess glutamate binding to its otherreceptor types which are called ampareceptors for those of you that want toknow that's involved in that processit's typical levels of activityif however I were to sit down at thisdesk and be commanded to or decide to dosome specific motor limb movement let'ssay move my hand in a three dot sequencefor those of you watching you can seethis for those of you that are listeningdon't worry about it it's not veryinteresting to watch the point is justthat I'm going to put my finger down inone two three points on the desk infront of me and then three two one pointcoming back to me now that's obviously amotor sequence that I can perform I justdid it so clearly I can perform it butif I were to do that for let's say anhourwhat would happen is the neurons thatare involved in generating that motorsequence of one two three three two oneone two three three two one would beactive over and over and over again andwhat would likely happen because of thatunusual frankly motor behavior is thatthe neurons responsible for generatingthat motor Behavior would be able todetect it as unusually frequentunusually high levels of activity in thecircuits that generate that behavior andthe increase in glutamate that'simpinging on the neurons in that circuitwould bind the nmda receptor making itchange several important things thefirst of which is that your nervoussystem is capable of changing but that'san energetically demanding process sothe incredible thing aboutneuroplasticity is that when yougenerate an unusually high or just anunusual pattern of activity motoractivity or you're hearing a newlanguage you're trying to learn that oryou're navigating a new city the neuronsare firing in ways that are atypical forthem and they are firing a lot more andso the neurons are going to bindglutamate they the nmda receptor isgoing to be activated and thenDownstream of nmda receptor activationare a bunch of what we callintracellular processes a bunch ofthings that happen in the cells to tryand make that behavior occur again andagain if needed but without the hugeenergetic demand you've experienced thisbefore when you're trying to learnsomething and it feels sluggish it feelshard it's frustrating and theneventually you learn it and it's veryfacile it's very easyone of the reasons for that is that whenthe nmda receptor is activated by theseinfrequent or unusual patterns ofactivity it can then recruit otherglutamate receptors the more typicalkind the ampa type receptors to the cellsurface and then those receptors cansimply bind the glutamate and allow thatbehavior to occur without this wholeprocess that's involved inneuroplasticity having to engage and dothings like build new proteins in thecell build new Machinery Etc so to juststep back from this the way to thinkabout the nmda receptor is thatactivation of the nmda receptor onlyoccurs under conditions of unusuallyhigh or simply unusual patterns ofactivity that the nmda receptor yescontrols neural activity in theimmediate sense like when it's activatedit's changing the patterns of activityin the neuron sure but it also canengage gene expression and introduce newreceptors to the cell basically givingthe cell the ability to then recreatethe same patterns of activity withouthaving to do it in such a metabolicallydemanding way in fact a good analogy forall of this is the way that muscles canhypertrophy right if you overloadmuscles properly through resistancetraining of any kind and then give thema period of rest there's recruitment ofspecific things to the muscle fibers aswell as recruitment of changes in thenerves that innervate that control thecontraction of those muscles and thenthose muscles grow they get stronger Etcand they are able to function and usethat new strength and new growth and youdon't have to damage those muscle fibersor trigger those adaptations over andover again to maintain them because youhave this new capability now I realizethat's a lot of details about nmda"

            "text": "receptors and neuroplasticity but reallyif we needed to pick one biologicalmechanism that resides at the center ofmany many important forms ofneuroplasticity it would be the nmdareceptor and its functions that I justtold you about so now that you have thatin mind that these nmda receptors arecritical at detecting unusual activitymaking changes to cells so the cells canthen respect respond to that activity inthe future you have in mind theconceptual basis for understanding howketamine works because as I've mentionedseveral times already ketamine is annmda receptor blocker antagonist and yetwe know that a lot of the changes in thebrain that underlie the transition froma depressed state to a non-depressedstate involve neuroplasticity so what'sgoing on there well what's going onthere turns out to be extremelyinteresting and you can understand itvery easily if you understand that thereare essentially two major types ofneurons in the brain you have thoseexcitatory neurons meaning neurons thatwhen they are activated electricallythey activate or excite other neurons atleast they try to they releaseneurotransmitter into the synapse whichis the little gap between neurons theneurons on the other side have receptorsthey bind those neurotransmitters inthis case glutamate which is the majorexcitatory neurotransmitter in the brainand then there's a high probability thatthose other neurons will be excited thatthey will be electrically active that'sone major type of so-calledneurotransmission in the brain the othermajor type of neurotransmission in thebrain is called inhibitoryneurotransmission inhibitoryneurotransmission involves neurons thatrelease the neurotransmitter Gaba orsometimes also another molecule calledglycine but mostly Gaba when Gaba isreleased it has the property of reducingthe probability that the next neuronwill be electrically active in factgaba's job is to bind to receptors onthe next cell and to make it lesselectrically active so we've gotexcitatory neurotransmission and we haveinhibitory neurotransmission and just toplace inhibitory and excitatoryneurotransmission into context if youthink about a condition like epilepsywhich involves seizures of either thesmaller type called petit mal seizuresor grand mal seizures which are the typein which people have body-wideconvulsions they are often disengagedfrom whatever's going on around them inthose moments they're shaking quite alot Etc there are many causes ofseizures but to get to the heart of whata seizure is it is essentially runawayexcitation in the brain a small regionof the brain becomes especiallyelectrically active and then it spreadsout from that Foci that focus of theexcitation and it recruits a lot ofneurons in a fairly non-specific waycreating these seizure-like motorpatterns in the body and patterns ofactivity in the brain that can involvedisengagement from immediate experienceand lack of perception sometimes there'sAura there's a whole discussion to behad about seizure and by the way seizurecan occur in a lot of different contextsof course it can occur in epilepsy itcan occur after a head injuryEtc we'll cover seizure in a futureepisode of this podcast of course butone of the major causes of seizure andby extension lack of seizure is thatordinarily inhibitory neurons andexcitatory neurons are in this kind ofpush-pull that for somebody that doesn'texperience seizures puts the brain inBalance so they don't have seizuresright the inhibitory neuron aresuppressing the activity of many neuronsso that those many neurons don't getrunaway excitation you don't getseizures the excitatory neurons arefeeding back onto the inhibitory neuronsso everything is kept in Balance thereisn't too much inhibition there isn'ttoo much excitation everything's inBalance okay so now you understand thatthere are nmda receptors and these arecritical for many forms ofneuroplasticity you also understand thatthere are excitatory neurons whichstimulate the electrical activity ofother neuronsand that there are inhibitory neurons inyour brain that inhibit or suppress theactivity of other neurons and that youneed excitatory and inhibitorycommunication between neurons at alltimes and that it has to remain inbalance and that the nmda receptor isnormally just sort of sitting there notdoing a whole lot unless levels ofneural activity are elevated above theirnormal Baseline and then you can getchanges in the neural circuits and thosechanges can be very long lasting andlet's not forget the piece ofinformation most pertinent to today'sdiscussion which is about ketamine whichis that ketamine blocks that nmdareceptor and there's the conundrum Ikeep coming back to which is you needneuroplasticity in order to get relieffrom depression so what researchers havediscovered is that yes ketamine blocksthe nmda receptor it actually quietsdown neurons it prevents neurons frombeing as active as they normally wouldbe and yet somehow almost paradoxicallyit increases neuroplasticity in braincircuits that are involved in mood andreward in self-reflection we'll get intowhat those brain circuits are in alittle bitthe way it works is that ketamine bindsto the nmda receptor present oninhibitory neurons and in doing sodramatically reduces the amount ofinhibition coming from those inhibitoryneurons onto excitatory neuronswhen that happens the excitatory neuronsin specific circuits of the brain areallowed to increase their activity theydo what's called bursting bursting is apattern of electrical activity wherebynormally one of these excitatory neuronsis releasing glutamate in a pattern thatmight look or sound like this itactually doesn't make a sound in thebrain but if you were to record from oneof these neurons which people have donemany times over and then you were toconvert the electrical signal in thoseneurons to an audio monitor you wouldhear the firing the action potential ofthose neurons as a that's what itactually sounds like on the AudioMonitor it sounds like a little bit ofstaticbut if the normal firing of the neuroniswhich is the pretty typical Baselinefiring of the neurons in the relevantcircuits to mood that I'm going to bediscussing under conditions whereketamine has been brought into thesystem binds that nmda receptorblocks the output of those inhibitoryneurons onto the excitatory neuron nowthe excitatory neuron is firing in burstand those bursting patterns ofelectrical activity are the absoluteperfect patterns of activity that inducenot just short-term but long-termchanges in the neural circuitsassociated with reward with dopaminerelease with disappointment and withmood in ways that are directly relevantto suppressing or providing relief fromthe symptoms of major depression now Irealized what I just told you is a lot"

            "text": "of information in fact what I justdescribed represents essentially what Iwould teach to an advanced undergraduategraduate course Medical School course onneuroplasticity and how ketamine worksso keep in mind that we're having adiscussion here that is at a fairly highlevel and if you could understand even atiny fraction even just one bit it whatI just described you're doing great ifyou could understand moreoutstandingjust to make sure that everyone's on thesame page as we move forward because Ido want to make sure that everyoneunderstands ketamine and how it worksbecause it does have these sort ofcryptic functions of engagingneuroplasticity in ways that aren'tobvious if you just ask you know whatdoes ketamine do when you inject it whatdoes ketamine produce in terms of afeeling State and then you know how doessomebody get relief from depression thatcan all start to get a little bitmuddled unless you understand thefollowing so I'm going to tell it to youagain in just very top Contour termssomebody takes a pill or an injection orsublingual ketamine it makes its wayinto the bloodstream and then it makesits way into the brain once it's in thebrain it binds to a particular categoryof receptors called the nmda receptorthe nmda receptor is a receptor thatnormally is quiescent it's just kind ofsitting there it doesn't tend to do alot under normal conditions of everydaylife however the nmda receptors typicalfunction okay so when there's noketamine in the body or brain is to todetect abnormal levels of neuralactivity and in doing so recruit changesto cells receptors Etc literally changethe neurons in ways that allow them torespond to that activity in the futurewithout having to be under such bigmetabolic demand and they do that byrecruiting more receptors Etc much inthe same way as when you overload amuscle in the gym it will eventuallyrecover if you allow it to recover andit will get stronger through theaddition of a bunch of new proteins thenerve communication of that muscle willchange the muscle and the nerve tomuscle connection change it getsstronger and sometimes it gets biggerand stronger in the same way a neuroncan change the way it functions inresponse to experience and neurons don'tknow experience of life in any other wayexcept the patterns of electricalactivity and chemical activity thatimpinges on them okay now ketamine thedrug binds to and blocks that nmdareceptor so the obvious conclusion wouldbe that ketamine preventsneuroplasticity and that's not whathappens we know that ketamine actuallyinduces neuroplasticity and it does sospecifically in the brain circuits thatcontrol moodthe net consequence being improvementsin mood how does that happen it happensbecause ketamine binds to and blocksthose nmda receptors on inhibitoryneurons the inhibitory neurons are theneurons that normally suppress theactivity of other neurons so whenketamine binds to the nmda receptorthe activity of those inhibitory neuronsis reduced and as a consequenceexcitatory communication between neuronsin those mood-related circuits increasesand it increases it in a way thatrecruits neuroplasticity thatstrengthens those connections and makesthem more likely to be active in thefuture now it is not the case at leastat clinical doses the ketamine inducesseizures it certainly can at higherdoses but at clinical doses whenketamine suppresses the activity ofthose inhibitory neurons and theexcitatory neurons ramp up theiractivity they're ramping up theiractivity a lot and enough to createchanges in those neural circuitsassociated with mood and the changes arein the direction of making those neuralcircuits more likely to generatepositive mood and less likely togenerate negative mood we'll get intothe specifics of those circuits in alittle bitbut ketamine is not creating the kind ofenormous increases in excitatorycommunication between neurons that leadsto that runaway excitation now the pointof the discussion we just had over thelast 10 minutes or so was several foldfirst of all I do believe it's importantto understand the key components ofneuroplasticity which is this remarkablefeature of our brain and nervous systemthat we all have right this ability tochange our own brain circuits no otherorgan in the body as far as we know candirect its own changes but we can directour own brain changes and the nmdareceptor is absolutely critical for thatI also think it's important tounderstand the difference betweeninhibitory and excitatory communicationbetween neurons because that's justCentral to understanding brain functionbrain function is a series ofaccelerators and breaks it's not allabout neurons stimulating other neuronsit's also about neurons preventing theactivation of other neurons that's justCentral to everything not justpreventing seizures but it's Central tolearning it's Central to vision isCentral to hearing it's Central tocreativity it is at the core of brainfunction and the other reason to havethe discussion we just did is thatketamine has this incredible property itcan literally change the neural circuitsthat generate mood that generate yourfeelings of well-being but it does sothrough a somewhat convoluted pathwayright it blocks the receptor thateveryone thinks is involved inneuroplasticity and in doing so itactually creates neuroplasticity noweven though I just described all of thatto you over the last 10 minutes or sokeep in mind that what I just describedto you as a process that actually occursin the brain takes many many days itinvolves cells changing gene expressionmaking new proteins new receptorsanytime we say neuroplasticity even whenyou read about so-called short-termneuroplasticity it is happening over thecourse of at least many many hours andmore likely many days or even weeks sothe process I just described of howketamine creates neuroplasticity throughblockade of nmda receptors is verylikely to be the process that explainsthe longer term changes in mood andaffect that are associated with ketaminetherapy for the treatment of depressionnow it is possible that ketamineblocking the nmda receptor is alsoresponsible for some of the immediateeffects of ketamine that peopleexperience when they take the drug thedissociation the in some cases euphoriaand that sort of dreamlike state that itcan put people into that is possible butit's very clear that the nmda receptorblockade is critical for theneuroplastic changes that are going tooccur over the days and weeks followingketamine treatment and if you think backto our earlier discussion when we weretalking about the two time a week overthree week type regimen of takingketamine or some variant on that now itmight start to make sense as to why yesthere is immediate and short-termbenefit of taking ketamine fordepression in the clinically appropriatesetting of course I'm not talking aboutrecreational use right now but that alsothere's some durability of those effectsthat even after the three weeks oftaking ketamine twice per week peopleoften will experience weeks or months ofrelief from depression when they're notdoing the weekly ketamine therapysessions so that longer term relief thatI'm referring to as durability of thetreatment is very likely to be theconsequence of actual neural circuitreward wiring now there's an additionaland very important facet to this whole"

            "text": "discussion about neuroplasticity inresponse to ketamine treatment fordepression if you recall that the burstfiring that induces that plasticityI told you it induces plasticity but Ididn't tell you how now you alreadycould imagine some of the mechanisms itcould be insertion of those newglutamate receptors those ampa receptorsthat we talked about however even forthat to happen a bunch of other thingshave to happen first but one of the keyones to understand is the thing Imentioned at the beginning of today'sepisode bdnf which stands for brainderived nootrophic Factor brain derivednootrophic factor is an incrediblemolecule I should mention that it's oneof many growth factors in the brainand it has its own set of receptors itbinds to something called the track Breceptor trkb Trek B receptor when bdnfbinds to track B receptors on neurons itdoes a lot of things it sets off a wholeCascade of things includingthe insertion of new glutamate receptorsso that those neurons become extrasensitive to any input they get and sothat's one form of change that bdnf cancreate bdnf can also alter the overallshape of neurons it can cause neurons togrow new branches so that it can receivenew inputs from other neurons anytimebdnf is discussed in popular books orthe popular press people will talk aboutit as quote unquote fertilizer forneurons I don't really like that termbecause it really undervalues the totalnumber of things that bdnf can do bdnfactually can act as its own kind ofneurotransmitter it can actuallystimulate other neurons and it does abunch of other things but for sake ofthis discussion about ketamineunderstand that that burst firing ofneurons that very high frequencyfiring of neurons can invoke the releaseof bdnf in ways that make those circuitsvery plastic very quickly and inaddition to that there's some evidencethat can I mean itself may be able tocause release of bdnf directly withouthaving to go through all of themechanisms that I overwhelmed you with afew minutes ago or hopefully didn'toverwhelm you with but that I talked toyou a few minutes ago now what'sespecially exciting about bdnf in thecontext of ketamine therapy fordepression is that it appears based onboth pre-clinical and clinical studiesthat bdnf isn't just one of the ways inwhich ketamine can invokeneuroplasticity and these improvementsin mood it may actually be required itmay be the central process to all ofthat now it can still be Downstream ofall that nmda receptor stuff that wetalked about before but there areseveral lines of evidence that suggestthat ketamine-induced release of bdnf isone of the core mechanisms by whichketamine can relieve depression nowthere are several lines of evidence tosupport what I just said about bdnf inthe context of ketamine first of allin mice that lack bdnf they have no bdnfthey can't make bdnf because they don'thave the gene for bdnf we call thosebdnf knockout mice in those mice if yougive them ketamine and you put them intothat learned helplessness task that wetalked about a bit earlier where you putthem into water and see how long theyswim normally ketamine would allow amouse to swim longer to fight for itslife longer well it no longer does thatin a bdnf knockout Mouse and the onlything that's different about that Mouseas far as we know is the lack of bdnfand there are ways to make sure thatit's lack of bdnf in the specificneurons that are relevant to everythingwe're talking about not just that theirlimbs don't work as well Etc in otherwords all the appropriate controlexperiments have been done that'spre-clinical data because it comes fromanimal models in addition to thatdepressed people who have a mutant formof bdnf so these humans are notKnockouts for bdnf they can make bdnfbut the bdnf doesn't function normallyin those peoplethey have a very reduced response toketamine treatment for depressionsuggesting that bdnf action is at leastone of the critical functions thatallows ketamine to relieve depressionand as I mentioned earlier ketamine canactually invoke the release of bdnf andget this there's some evidence thatketamine itself can bind to the track Breceptor that is it can bind to the bdnfreceptor it can mimic bdnfso this is an entirely different way ofthinking about ketamine than we normallyhear about nowadays we hear a lot aboutketamine and ketamine therapy we alsohear fortunately about some of theproblems of ketamine abuse and we willtalk about some of those concerns alittle bit laterand we hear about bdnf this so-calledbrain fertilizer but rarely if ever dowe hear that ketamine itself can mimicthe effects of bdnf in the brain butresearchers and clinicians aredefinitely paying attention to this andit's starting to raise what I consider avery exciting model of how ketaminecould provide relief for depressionwhich is that it's acting as a growthfactor in the brain or at least it'smimicking the action of growth factorsallowing the specific neural circuitsthat control things like mood outlook onthe future self-reflection Etc allowingthose circuits to change in ways thatprovide significant relief for majordepression and in doing so and this is avery important point it appears thatketamine is relieving depression in waysthat are entirely different from anyother kind of treatment now in anearlier episode about psilocybin and itspotential role for the treatment ofdepression I went into a lot of depthabout how psilocybin can induceneuroplasticity to provide relief formajor depression in certain individualsunder certain conditions I do want tohighlight that because indeed it'sanother case where neuroplasticity isinvolved but in that situation as someof you may remember or if you don'tdon't worry I'll tell you right now itwas a pretty straightforward modelpsilocybin looks a lot like serotoninchemically except that psilocybin bindsa particular receptor when that receptoris bound it allows these brainwidechanges those brain wide changes seem tochange one's reflection on oneselfso-called ego dissolution changes andmood that are stable over timeetc etc it was all prettystraightforward with ketamine it's clearthere are multiple mechanisms involvedand perhaps most importantly withketamine it's that immediate relief thatoccurs day of or close to day oftreatment and in the days afterwards andit's that long-term relief that verylikely is the consequence of nmdareceptor suppression burst activity inneurons Within These mood relatedcircuits bdnf being released andchanging neural circuits strengtheningthem in order to give elevated mood as aconsequence of that bursting activityand ketamine mimicking bdnf in otherwords ketamine acting more or less likea growth factor in the brain in order tomake sure that whatever changes occur inthose neural circuits to elevate moodare durable that they really arereinforced and last over time I'd liketo just take a brief break and thank one"

worksI'm not just talking about how ketamineprovides relief for depression I'm alsotalking about why people use ketaminefor recreational purposes and it is thefollowingyes ketamine has all these impacts onexcitatory neurons inhibitory neuronsbdnf etc etc but ketamine can also bindreceptors in the opioid pathway now whatis the opioid pathway don't worry hereI'm not going to hit you with a lot ofdetails but we've all heard of theopioid crisis by now or at least most ofyou havethe opioid crisis refers specifically topeople taking exogenous opioids takingopioids right so taking pills thatactivate particular receptors in thebrain that lead toanalgesia in some cases so pain reliefthat lead to changes in mood there's alot to be said about the opioid crisisit's called a crisis for a reason manymany people are addicted to thosecompoundsthat's a discussion for another timekeep in mind that The receptors thosedrugs bind to are opioid receptors andthose receptors that you and I all haveby the way do not exist in order to binddrugs that are made by pharmaceuticalcompanies they exist in our brain andbody to bind to the so-called endogenousnaturally made opioids that we all makeand those receptors have different namesthe MU opioid receptor the Kappa opioidreceptor Etc they tend to have the namesof Greek letters to differentiate themnow ketamine can bind to various opioidreceptors and when opioid receptors arebound we know that creates certaineffects things like pain relief thingslike changes in psychic Statesdissociation for example if enough ofthem are bound you can get euphoricStates under certain conditions ofhigh-dose binding of ketamine to thoseopioid receptors you can start gettinginto planes of anesthesia where peoplelose Consciousness and actually have noresponse to pain whatsoever if yourecall the clinical studies we talkedabout earlier where ketamine was used torelieve depressionwell the dosage used in that study asyou recall was half a milligram perkilogram of body weight that is thedosage that will induce thesedissociative mild euphoriathose sorts of states of mind but wherepeople are still conscious when youstart getting to dosages of ketaminethat are in the range of one to twomilligrams per kilogram of body weightnow you're talking about anestheticDoses and when that happens you're goingto get full parking full saturation ofall the potential receptors thatketamine can bind to those nmdareceptors it's going to block those it'salso going to bind to the so-called muopioid receptors and maybe this othertype as well for those of you that wantto know you Aficionado is also the Kappatype opioid receptors and so what we'vegot here is a drug ketamine that ishitting two different systems theglutamate-related systemand the endogenous opioid system andresearchers and clinicians havelogically started to ask whether or notsome or all of the effects of ketamineare due to the opioid systemand they want to know which effectsthose are now this is where things startto get really interesting both in thecontext of clinical treatment ofdepression and recreational usefirst of allwhen people take ketamineagain it enters the bloodstream and itgoes into the brain but it ismetabolized to something called hnkwhich is hydroxy nor ketamine now Idon't expect you to know what hydroxynor ketamine is and I don't expect youto care about it until I tell you whatI'm about to tell you which is thathydroxy nor ketamine has an incrediblespecificity for the MU opioid receptorand maybe that Kappa opioid receptor aswell in other words when we talk aboutketamine that's the drug people take butwhen it goes into the body it'sconverted into yet another drug and thatother drug hydroxine or ketamine isselectively activating the opioid systemso this led researchers to ask at a veryimportant question which is when a humanbeing takes ketamine in order to treattheir depressionand they get some relief from depressionis that the consequence of neuroplasticchanges in all those nmda glutamate bdnfrelated circuits that we talked aboutbefore or is it the consequence ofsomething happening in the opioid systemokay you can't ignore the fact thatketamine has this property of binding tothese opioid receptors because they havesuch a powerful effect on our thinkingon our mood on our state ofconsciousnessit's entirely reasonable that the opioidsystem could be a major player if notthe major player in this wholedepression relief thing and maybe evenin the creation of dissociativesymptomology when people take ketaminerecreationally so what researchers slashclinicians did is they undertook aseries of experiments where they gavepeople ketamine for the relief ofdepression but they also blocked theopioid receptor system and they did thatusing a drug called Naltrexone so whatI'm about to describe to you is a studydone by my colleagues at Stanford Schoolof Medicine namely Dr Nolan Williams andAlan schatzberg and colleagues entitledattenuation of antidepressant andanti-suicidal effects of ketamine byopioid receptor antagonism and as aconsequence of me reading you that titlea moment ago you now already have theconclusion of the study what theyobserved is that when people were givenketamine they got relief from depressionthat wasn't surprising again manystudies had shown that before since theearly 2000sif however individuals were givenNaltrexone to block the opioid receptorpathwayand they were given ketamine well thenthe antidepressant effects of ketaminewere no longer observed now thatsuggests that it is the opioid receptorsystem that's responsible for theantidepressant effects of ketamine andperhaps this hnk this hydroxy norketamine which is the metabolite ofketamine is the way in which ketaminenormally relieves depressionnow a lot of people took note of thesestudies because after all there are"

            "text": "probably dozens if not hundreds ofstudies looking at the effects ofketamine on all that nmda receptor stuffand indeed neuroplasticity and moodrelated circuits can't be discounted asone way in which ketamine providesrelief from depressionbut what was very interesting is that inpeople given ketamine and Naltrexonethose people still experienced theimmediate effects of ketamine the mildEuphoria the dissociation the feelingsthat one would normally expect whenpeople were under the effects ofketamine but what they didn't get werethe longer term changes in mood that wewould call relief from depression now ofcourse the goal of modern Psychiatry isto treat depression not to block theeffects of these drugs that are capableof treating depression now what thisstudy does and by the way there areseveral studies like it that supportthese General set of findings that partof the critical role of ketamine inproviding relief from depression is toactivate the opioid system but what thisstudy does is it really points to thefact that when we say ketamine treatmentor we talk about somebody takingketamine recreationally for that matterwe have to pay attention to what'shappening while they are under theinfluence of the drugwe also have to pay attention to what'shappening in the days and weeks afterthey're under the influence of the drugand perhaps most importantly this callsto mind a really important idea which isthat whether or not you're talking aboutketamine-induced relief from depressionor psilocybin induced relief fordepression or MDMA induced relief forPTSD a topic that I covered on aprevious episode of this podcastwe have to step back and look at theidea that the effects of the drug thatpeople experience whatever those may bebecause obviously it's going to dependon what particular drug they tookthose immediate effects may not actuallybe related to the long-term clinicalbenefit of those particular drugs now Irealize that many people might not likethat idea and frankly I don't actuallythink that's the way that it works Idon't think it's going to be an eitheror situation however because drugs likeketamine psilocybin MDMA have suchprofound effects on people's psychicStates when they are under the influenceof them and because at least in theproper clinical setting and use they doseem to provide impressive relief from alot of these psychiatric challenges likedepression and PTSDpeople naturally correlate those twothings they couple those two things infact they collapse those two things andpresume that their experience of whatthey saw what they heard how they feltwhile they were under the influence ofthe drug was actually the stimulus thatcreated the relief from their clinicalcondition like depression but what thesedata on combined treatment with ketamineand Naltrexone to block the MU opioidreceptor really show us is that that maynot actually be the way that it works itmay be that the effects of a drug likeketamine that one experiences whileinteresting perhaps even profoundperhaps great Insight comes to one whenthey do that therapy in the propercontextit is not clear at all that it is thatexperience and the effects of thosedrugs in those immediate minutes andhours that's actually what's causing therelief from depression now again I don'tthink it's an either or I like to viewthe whole situation more or less as asort of wave front that the experiencethat one has subjectively while they areunder the influence of a drug likeketamine or psilocybin or MDMA sets offa series and in fact multiple series isthat a word multiple types of processesin the brain some of which rely onthings like nmda receptor bdnf Etc typeneuroplasticity others which rely on theopioid receptor pathway and that each ofthese have different time courses suchthat some provide immediate relief inthe days and hours after treatment somein the weeks after treatment and somemore durable long-lasting changes thatcan occur over months or maybe evenyears and a really important thing tounderscore in the context of of all thisis that throughout today's discussionwe've been talking about drugs andreceptors and relief from depression butwhat we're really talking about here arepeople who get relief from depressionand almost with certainty when they getrelief from depression they are alsostarting to do other things they aregoing back to work they are engaging inrelationships again they are viewingthemselves differently again hopefullythey're getting morning sunlight andexercising and eating well and doing allthe sorts of things that we would callanti-depressive behaviors and it isimpossible to separate the positivebehavioral consequences of a drugtreatment for depression from the drugitself in a way that lets us say Okayketamine relieved depression and then asa consequence people went and did abunch of behaviors that were healthy forthem or stopped engaging in behaviorsthat were unhealthy for them so we canthink of behaviors as pro-depressive orantidepressive in fact we know that oneparticular behavior that is viewing bluelight in the middle of the night betweenthe hours of say 11 pm and 4 AM is knownto invoke a pro-dopressive circuit itinvolves a structure called the habenulaI've talked about this on previouspodcasts it tends to lower dopamine andincrease cortisol and the day isfollowing that exposure to lightEtc et cetera so there arepro-depressive behaviors and there areanti-depressive behaviors we know thatviewing morning sunlight getting regularand sufficient amounts of quality sleepproper nutrition proper socialengagement there is now a plethora ofquality research pointing to the factthat those are true anti-depressivebehaviors so we can never separate outthe effects of a drug from the effectsof a drug that feed back on and combinewith the effects of the drug that one ishoping for in this case depressionrelief okay so I've been bookending this"

detailabout that but that's pretty high levelwe're talking about thought changesbehavioral changes that we're callinganti-depressive right changes in moodand affect that are positive positiveanticipation of the future etc etc andthen we've also been talking a lot atthis other end which is veryreductionist down at the sellermolecular level we're talking aboutreceptors and binding of receptors andneuroplasticity and track B and all thatstuff we've completely neglected meaningI've completely neglected until nowwhat Bridges those two levels ofunderstanding and what Bridges those twolevels of understanding are the neuralcircuits that actually change when onetakes ketamine whether or not thosechanges occur quickly whether or notthey take a longer period of timewhether or not they involve an MDAreceptors or the opioid receptor systemsor bothwe know that certain neural circuitschange when people take ketamine inthese patterns of dosage and frequencyof about half a milligram per kilogramand again that's the injected form twiceper week over three weeks and then theyget some durable resistance todepression fortunately we can talk aboutthose neural circuits without having tobring about a lot more nomenclature alot of new language and I sayfortunately because I realize todayyou've been hit with a lot of new termsnow I've already mentioned one of thekey brain structures and that's thehabenula a few moments ago I talkedabout the habenula in the context ofpeople who get too much bright the lightexposure in the middle of the night thatactivates the habenula it's a sort of adisappointment circuit we can call itthat because we know that it leads topro-dopressive symptoms in animal modelsand very likely in humans as well and itdoes so we know by reducing dopamine andincreasing cortisol there is evidencethat when people undergo ketaminetherapy connections between the habenulawhat we can broadly just talk about is astructure involved in gen generating afeeling of disappointmentthe connections between the habenula andthe reward circuitry of the brain whichI've talked about several times beforeon this podcast but for those of youthat aren't familiar with it this is theso-called mesolimbic reward pathway ithas areas like the ventral tegmentalarea the nucleus accumbens don't worryat all about those names just know thatthis is a brain area that ischock-a-block full of neurons thatrelease dopamine which is a moleculethat tends to increase mood increasemotivation in many ways we can thinkabout it at least for sake of thisdiscussion as anti-depressive so whatwe've got is a structure the habenulathat normally provides inhibitory andnow you know what that means inhibitoryinput to this reward pathway thatreleases dopamine and when people takeketamine that inhibition is lessenedsuch that the reward pathway is moreavailable for engagement through dailylife activities now I say available forengagement through daily life activitiesfor a very specific purpose which isthat all the changes in neural circuitsthat we're talking about that can comeabout from taking a drug well thosechanges don't actually do a whole lotunless those circuits are reinforced byparticular behaviors so this relatesback to what I said just a few minutesago aboutpro-depressive and anti-depressivebehaviors somebody can take ketamine andpotentially get relief from depressionbut if they continue to engage inpro-dopressive behaviorsthey are not going to get much of anyrelief from depression conversely ifsomebody takes ketamine and they arereducing the amount of output from thisdisappointment circuit this habenula tothe reward circuitry of the brain andthey do engage in behaviors such asseeking out work that stimulates themseeking out social engagement takinggood care of their body their mentalhealth their physical health Etc wellthose circuits are not designed torespond to ketamine they are designed torespond to particular patterns ofthinking and behavior so again we can'tforget that when we hear that a drugcauses plasticity in a given neuralcircuit what it's doing is it's biasingthe balance or the probability thatthose neural circuits will be engaged bycertain activities but one still has toengage in those activities nowfortunately when people tend to haveelevations in mood they tend to movearound more when they tend to movearound more they tend to engage in morethings when they tend to engage in morethings if they have a positive outlookon life presumably they are engaging inadaptive things things like socialrelationships job related School relatedgoal-related Behavior so it's importantto understand that a discussion ofneural circuit changes in response toketamine is really a discussion ofneural circuit changes in response toketamine that shift one's overall systemtoward having yet further neural circuitchanges in response to daily activitiesand thereby bolstering health or in thiscase mental health now it's alsoimportant to understand that rarely if"

            "text": "sense of dissociation when it's taken atsub anesthetic doses if you recall theclinical studies we talked about earlierthey injected half a milligram perkilogram of body weight in order toprovide depression relief for thosepatients when people take ketamine theywill take it by different routes ofdelivery and now here we have to expandour conversation to include both theclinical context research studies andrecreational usenow I do that because typically whenpeople take ketamine in a study in aclinical study they will get anintravenous into the vein or anintramuscular into the muscle injectionof half a milligram per kilogram of bodyweight ketamine however when people aretaking ketamine recreationally or whenthey are accessing ketamine legally byprescription and taking it at home whichis becoming a more common practice theywill often take it orally in pill formor they will take it sublingually byputting it under the tongue or in theircheek and then that so-called trochedissolves and the ketamine goes intotheir system now an important thing tounderstand is that when people takeketamine orally only 25 percent of theactive form of ketamine makes it intothe bloodstream and when they take itsublingually typically only about 35percent of the total amount of ketaminethey take is converted intometabolically active ketamine that actson the neurons in their brain so whenyou hear about the dosages used instudies they are going to generallyinvolve injections of ketamine and farlower doses of ketamine than when youhear about people taking ketamine orallyor sublingually so for instance I weigh220 pounds that's 100 kilograms so if Iwere to be in one of these studies whichI have not been but if I wereI would be given 50 milligrams ofketamine by way of injection however ifI were going to try to achieve the sameamount of active ketamine in mybloodstream and brain as I would throughinjection I would need to ingest threetimes as much ketamine by way of pilland perhaps a little bit more by way ofsublingual ketamine if I wanted to getthe same effects so if I were to take 50milligrams by way of injection in astudy and I went to a different studyand they said okay we want to recreatethat effect we're going to give you apill typically they're going to give me150 milligrams of ketamine in a pillform or 200 milligrams of ketamine inthe troche sublingual form now it'sreally important to understand this dosedependence according to deliverybusiness because I realize that nowadaysespecially a lot of people are takingketamine through legal sources sothey're accessing it legally but they'retaking it outside the clinic and moretypically they're taking it not by wayof injection meaning they're takinghigher dose ketamine and they're takingit sublingually or orally so it's veryimportant to understand this dosedependence according to mode of deliverybusiness now in anticipation of thisepisode I put out a request forquestions about ketamine on Twitter andI got many many questions some Xexcellent ones they're in but one of themore common questions was what is ak-hole in scientific terms a k-hole iswhat's used to describe the subjectiveexperience of when somebody takesketamine typically recreationally andthey end up in basically apseudo-anesthetized statewhat that means is that they took adosage that for them put them beyond theboundary of the sub anesthetic dose andhas them transitioning into theanesthesia level dose of ketaminenow I mentioned everything I did aboutdosages before because it's veryimportant to know that different peopleeven if they are of equivalent bodyweight are going to respond to ketaminedifferently depending on how quickly andhow thoroughly they metabolize ketaminesoin the clinical context injections ofketamine into the vein or into themuscle are done at this half a milligramper kilogram dose and they haveclinicians there they have researchersthere who are paying attention towhether or not the person is in aassociative state if they're stillconscious and to see whether or not theperson is going into full-blownanesthesia now that's one of the valuesof doing ketamine in the context of alegal clinical setting however I'd beremiss if I didn't acknowledge that alot of people are getting ketaminelegally but then taking it at homehopefully not alone hopefully there'ssomeone there to monitor them wherethey're in session with their physicianover Zoom that's actually happening moreand more these days through Telehealthbut that itself also has certain risksright because if the person needssomething and they don't have someonethere immediately in the room to takecare of it that could be a veryproblematic situation and of coursethere are situations where people aretaking ketamine recreationallyregardless of how they're acquiring itthey're taking it and they are guessinghow they are going to respond to itbased on some crude understanding ofdosages but when people talk about ak-hole what they're talking about istaking ketamine at a dose that for themtakes them beyond the mild or perhapseven an extreme dissociationand starts placing them into full-blownanesthesia and that itself actually canbe dangerousgoing into anesthesia like planes ofConsciousness while not always deadlycan be deadly and it certainly can beand has been deadly when people start tocombine it with other drugs inparticular drugs like barbiturates oralcohol so I want to be very clear thatthe dosage ranges that you hear aboutwhen hearing about ketamine areextremely Broad and so is thevariability to any one given dose and sotoo is the response to a given dose in agiven person depending on the route ofdelivery you need to be very carefulabout the ability of ketamine to takeyou into deep deep planes ofunconsciousness and in some cases deathand of course as with any sedative oneneeds to be extremely cautious aboutdoing anything like driving or evenwalking in traffic or walking anywherein some cases if one is under theinfluence of ketamine additionally forthose of you that are seizure proneeither due to epilepsy or prior headinjury or maybe your seizure pronoun youdon't know it can mean can induceseizures and it should be completelyobvious to you now why that's the caseketamine blocks nmda receptors oninhibitory neurons and quiets theiractivity which of course can lead toRunaway

oral wasbetter than sublingual etc etcto be fair with one exception thedifferent modes of delivery probablyrelate more to dosage that actually getsmetabolized than to anything else what Imean by that is most people don't knowhow to equate the clinical dose of halfa milligram per kilogram of body weightinto a dosage to take orally orsublingually or in some cases by the waypeople will take it rectally and thereason people take ketamine rectally isthat rectal Administration bypasses theliver and indeed ketamine can be hard onthe liver to metabolize it candramatically increase liver enzymes sooftentimes people that are takingketamine frequently and don't want tocreate damage to the liver they will optfor a rectal Administration now Irealize that unless it's somehow relatedto your profession anytime somebody saysintraectally it raises a few eyebrowsand people you know kind of lean back alittle bit and I get it in a futureepisode of the podcast I promise todistinguish between the different modesof drug metabolism depending on whetheror not people take something orallysublingually by injection or rectallyanother common question I got when Isolicited for questions about ketamineon social media was about the R versus Sversus RS forms of ketamine and I musttell you that sent me down a deep deepRabbit Hole of research in which Idiscovered very contradictory evidencefor instance I could find papers I didfind papers that said that the r form ofketamine had a much greater affinity forthe nmda receptor than did the S form ofketamine I also found reviews that saidthe exact opposite okay and there I wassitting with the two reviews in front ofone another wondering if there wassomething wrong with my visual systemuntil I called a colleague Dr NolanWilliams who's a triple board certifiedneurologist psychiatrist at StanfordSchool of Medicine whose laboratoryspecializes in the use of ketamine forstudies of treating depression and fortreating depression in the clinicalpopulation so I asked him what's thedeal here I'm getting very contradictoryevidence and he spelled it all out formeit appears based on the clinical data inhumans and on binding studies that the Sform of ketamine is more potent that isit can more robustly bind to the nmdareceptor and in addition to that the Sform of ketamine tends to produce lessdissociation at a given dosage than doesthe combined Sr form of ketamine or pureR ketaminehe also added and sent me a study thatI'll link in the show note captions thatthere was recently a clinical trial ofr-ketamine so pure R ketamine aloneand it failed to relieve depressivesymptomsso I said great thank you so much thisis now all made very clear to me that sketamine is the preferred form itproduces less dissociation and itprovides better depression relief andthen he said no actually it's a littlemore complicated than that it appearsthe situation is the following thecombined Sr form of ketamine seems to bethe most potent for relieving depressivesymptomsthe S form of ketamineis second best in terms of providingrelief from depressive symptoms and isthe one that's most commonly prescribednowadaysby nasal spray by Oral dosing bysublingual dosing and it's what istypically given by way of injection inclinical studies where they doinjectionsand it appears that the r form ofketamine is the least potent andeffective in treating depression now Irealize that by putting this out intothe larger world and assuming that thereare experts in ketamine out there eitherby way of use or by clinical study oftheir own that I will get a lot ofcomments back saying no actually the rform was more effective for me than theS form versus the SR form Etc just toreiterate from the clinical trials thathave been done we know that the combinedSr form is more potent and effectivethan the pure s form which is still moreeffective than the pure R form so that'swhat we know now based on the clinicalstudies but of course I acknowledge thatanytime a drug is out there as aclinical tool and it's being usedrecreationally that people are going toexplore and they're going to experimentand they're going to find what worksbest for them so I certainly invitefeedback about what has worked best foryou hopefully in the clinical context sowhether or not people have used ketamineprescription from their doctor whetheror not they participated in a clinicalstudy or whether or not they're doing itrecreationally I imagine that I willhear about those experiences and I willtake note of them another commonly askedquestion I received was what aboutmicrodosing of ketamine there's a lot ofinterest in microdosing nowadays peopleare micro dosing psilocybin people aremicro dosing all sorts of things hopingto get some of the same effects as themacro doses but by using dosages ofcompounds that are below what wouldinduce say in the case of psilocybinhallucinations or in the case ofketamine below what would induce thekind of dissociation and euphoriceffects that one would have to lie downfor a few hours and disengage for therest of the day I consulted with myclinician colleagues about this and theytold me that at present meaning as ofyesterday there is zero publishedclinical evidence that they are aware ofand by way of extension that I am awareof in which microdosing ketamine hasbeen effective for the treatment ofdepression all of the positive effectson depression that I've talked aboutduring this episode are gleaned fromstudies where people used this halfmilligram per kilogram dosage ofketamine or its equivalent by way

    "episode_summary": "In this episode, I explain how ketamine causes rewiring of brain circuits and dissociative states to relieve symptoms of depression and post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). I explain how ketamine impacts both the brain\u2019s glutamate and its endogenous opioid pathways, which together regulate mood and well-being. I discuss how ketamine therapy is used clinically to treat major depression, bipolar depression, obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD), suicidality and other psychiatric challenges. I also describe how ketamine causes the subjective effects of dissociation and euphoria and, at higher doses, is an anesthetic. I compare the different routes of ketamine administration, dosages and forms of ketamine, and if micro-dosing ketamine is effective. I also highlight the potential risks of recreational ketamine use (and the colloquial term \u2018K-holes\u2019).
