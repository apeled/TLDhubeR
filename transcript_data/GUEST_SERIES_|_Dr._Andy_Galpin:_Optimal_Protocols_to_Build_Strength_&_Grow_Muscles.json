            "text": "[Music] welcome to the huberman lab guest Series where I and an expert guest discuss science and science-based tools for everyday life I'm Andrew huberman and I'm our professor of neurobiology and Ophthalmology at Stanford school of medicine today marks the second episode in the sixth episode series with Dr Andy Galpin a professor of kinesiology at Cal State University Fullerton and one of the foremost world's experts on the science and applications of methods to increase strength hypertrophy and endurance today's episode is all about how to increase strength speed and hypertrophy of muscles Professor Dr Andy Galpin great to be back last episode you told us about the nine specific adaptations that exercise can induce everything from strength and hypertrophy to endurance muscular endurance so on and so forth and you gave us this incredible toolkit of fit tests for each of those adaptations so that people can assess them for themselves and then of course improve on each and every one of them if they choose by the way people can access that information simply by going to the first episode in this series with you and it's all there and time stamped and I highly recommend people do that today we're talking about strength and hypertrophy and so right out the gate I just want to ask you why should people think about and train for strengthen hypertrophy and that question is of course directed towards those that are trying to get stronger and grow bigger muscles but I know that many people out there perhaps have not thought about the benefits of strength and hypertrophy training and how beneficial it can be not just for people that want to get bigger biceps Etc but that have other goals longevity goals and health goals unrelated to what most people associate with hypertrophy so what are the benefits of training for strength and hypertrophy for the everyday person for the athlete for the recreational exerciser and so on there's a wonderful saying I think it was Bill Bowerman the founder one of the founders of Nike and he always said if you have a body or an athlete and and I think that's very important for people to understand because one of the major disservices we've done in this field is convince people that things like strength training are for athletes or for growing bigger muscles and cardiovascular training are for things like fat loss and heart health and that is a tremendous disservice because it puts a lot of unnecessary barriers and leads to a lot of false assumptions and then therefore poor actions classic examples of this are people who are resistant to strength training because they don't want to put on too much muscle people who only perform one type of exercise because they want say fat loss or they're in it for longevity and health and they don't work they're not worried about you know being an athlete and so right out the gates we can actually draw back a little bit to what we were our previous conversation when I walked you through the history of exercise science and the reason I did that is to help you understand these are the railroads that you're running down and you don't even realize it in terms of everyone thinks of strength training and they immediately default to our principles to optimize muscle growth and that's not the only adaptation one should be after with strength training when we think of endurance training we immediately default to things like again cardiovascular health or fat loss or things like that what I really want to do across this entire series and conversations is to to just break that immediately talk about all the other things that you can do with your with your training and so that people can be comfortable and confident in doing an optimal training program for whatever goal they have whether that be specific like growing muscle or non-specific like just feeling better having more energy being more prepared for life and Longevity and so to directly answer your question I could really we could do a hundred episodes on the benefits of exercise and we could run all the way from mood and focus cognitive tasks to a better immune function you'll get less colds you'll be you'll fight them off more effectively to mortality right so some of the strongest predictors of how long and how well you will live are exercise however there are independent benefits that come from just endurance training and there are independent benefits that come from strength training and so to just give you one categorically the way that you want to think about this is resistance exercise and strength training is the number one tool to combat neuromuscular aging you cannot get that through any other form of exercise besides heavy overload strength training and we and we can walk through in detail what that is but that is reason number one in general human movement is is a function of number one some sort of neuromuscular Activation so nerves have to turn on the second part is muscles have to contract and the third part is those muscles have to move a bone all right if you want to be alive and you want to live by yourself you have to be able to engage in human movement if you have any dysfunction in the neuromuscular system there then you're not going to be able to do that and again as I mentioned the only way to preserve that or fight that loss of Aging is to strength train so people will tend to hear numbers like you lose about one percent of muscle size per year after age about 40. and that's true however what they don't realize is you lose about two to four percent of your strength per year so the loss of strength is almost double that the loss of muscle mass with aging muscle power is more like eight to ten percent per year and so we can very clearly see the problem you're going to have with aging is not going to be preservation of muscle although that is incredibly important it's going to be very specifically preservation of muscle power and strength and why that really matters is your ability to again stand up and move your ability to catch yourself from a fall your ability to feel confident doing a movement that is a function of muscle power more than it is muscle size and so functionality is really what we want to be right you want to be able to do whatever you want to be do physically and feel confident in doing that as you age that's going to only be obtained through strength training so is it appropriate to say that training for strength and hypertrophy is also a way to keep your nervous system healthy and young absolutely it is the only exercise route we have for that if you look at just basic numbers like motor units you're going to see that older individuals have like a 30 to 40 reduction in total motor units So when you say older approximately what ages are you referring to because I know many people out there such as myself are 40 and older but I know many of our listeners are in their 20s maybe even in their teens and I can imagine that people that start doing strength and hypertrophy training younger will afford themselves an advantage over time but that everybody should be doing strength and hypertrophy training for as much of their lifespan as possible that's really the message that I'm getting so if somebody is for instance 45 would that fall into the bin of older you're going to start seeing decrements passed again around that age of 40 or so now there's a lot of genetic variation there and a lot of other things go into that equation like your sleep and your nutrition but that's a fair number to sort of think about one actually responses it's actually sort of counterintuitive the wonderful thing about strength training is you don't actually have to start at a young age uh you can actually in fact I was reading a paper this morning because of our previous conversation it was an over age 90. so these are folks 90 plus and they saw improvements like 30 to 170 percent in things like muscle size and hypertrophy over a very short period of time I think it was 12 weeks so you don't actually have to start there are some adaptations that you're going to need for health that you God you really need to start in your 20s the reason I like to mention that is because if you are listening and you are 50 and you're like oh [\u00a0__\u00a0] I I haven't been strength training you're not toast like you should absolutely start now um but you're going to be able to get to a fantastic spot very quickly similarly though if you are 20 or 25 and 30 and you aren't lifting there are still many reasons why you should do that now and I I'd like to point that out because a lot of folks will be like oh my gosh they said I have to do it when I'm 20 or 25 or you know I'll be sort of screwed and that's not the case at all there's really no age limit on this in fact there's actually interesting data that just came out showing this reduction in muscle strength and I perjury that I sort of talked about is basically ameliorated with a preservation of activity in other words you don't lose these functionalities because of Aging you lose these because of a loss of training to state that again you don't lose these because of some innate physiological thing that happens with genes become less sensitive or you lose functionality you pretty much can describe the loss of function of strength and muscle and aging as exclusively because of a loss of training and nutrition and anabolic resistance and some other things so you can do a lot more than you think when it comes to maintaining high quality muscle and that's really important to point out I'm reminded of the words of the great sharington he won the Nobel Prize he's a physiologist I guess the neuroscientists try and claim him as a neuroscientist because he worked on the nervous system the physiologists claim as a as a physiologist he is 100 a physiologist I would call him a neuroscientist maybe we can argue about this later um we will but I think one of the key things that sharington pointed out was that I believe the quote was that movement is the final common path and what he was referring to was the fact that a significant fraction of the brain itself is devoted to our ability to move and our ability to engage in resistance type movements and that resistance type movements and the continuation of movement throughout the lifespan is what keeps the brain young and healthy and vital and there are so much data now to support that but I'm so grateful that you brought up early this fact that there's a neuromuscular link because I think a lot of people think about musculoskeletal they forget that the nervous system is really in charge of the um strength of the muscle contractions and the types of muscle contractions that occur I'm certain we're going to get into that in a lot of depth today you're close there we're not totally right but we're close Okay well I look forward to being corrected um and to achieving the Precision that you're known for uh around that discussion so if we are to step back and say strength training and hypertrophy training is critical for people of all ages yeah for developing and maintaining the neuromuscular system and for our ability to function in the world yeah not just offset injury but the ability to pick things up and move Etc what are some of the other things that "

            "text": "strengthen hypertrophy training can provide I know a lot of people use strength and hypertrophy training for changing their Aesthetics what is your sense about its potency for changing Aesthetics as compared to say cardiovascular exercise yeah the the Mantra I always like is the reason you want to exercise is threefold right you want to look good feel good play good that that's really that comes from sport comes from football specifically we always say that and what that means really is you want to look good people want to look the way they want to look whatever that means to them and there are any versions of what you feel to be aesthetically pleasing and that's totally irrelevant but people want to look the way they want to look number two you want to be able to feel good what's that mean you want to be injury free you want to have energy throughout the day you want to be able to execute anything you want to so whether you want to go surf in the morning you want to play racquetball you want to hike or you want to do all three of those in one day you should have the ability to do that and then you want to play good which means you should be able to execute any again activities that you want to execute whatever that means all right so backing all up what's that got to do with your question um one of the major benefits of strength training is the responses tend to happen extremely fast so you can see noticeable changes in muscle size certainly within a month absolutely within six weeks and so we have this wonderful feedback loop that sort of tells you am I doing the same correctly oh my gosh yes I am also it's very addicting the feedback the response the physical changes whether this is actually point two or three look good or feel good play good or it's even just part one you're starting to see that when you compare that to things like fat loss that Journey tends to be longer it's more difficult it's more Reliant upon other factors like nutrition Etc strength training is really about like there's some very minimal nutrition requirements outside of that it comes down to the training and the feedback is immediate that's powerful because if you look across the literature on exercise adherence you'll see that that is in fact the number one predictor of effectiveness of any training program so what that means is if you were to put any variable possible and figure out what is going to determine whether or not this program works this is what we typically call the methods or many in the concepts are few so the methods of exercise the methods of strength training the mess of the methods of hypertrophy training which we'll talk about are are infinite however there are only a handful of key Concepts that you have to achieve in order for that program to work adherence is one of them and again is often the top one so you need to do something you need to do something consistently when you are getting that feedback and you're seeing results in your appearance immediately and you see that every single day every time you take off your shirt or every time you look in the mirror you see that result that tends to drive adherence um really powerfully so it's important to give people wins especially people who are not maybe like you and I who are like I'm gonna lift weights and I'm gonna exercise like no matter what the rest of my life because I just love it not everyone's like that and so giving them a little bit of carrot of success and if you can achieve that in you know say three to four to five weeks already it's very powerful tool before we begin I'd like to emphasize that this podcast "

            "text": "if you would please remind us what strength and hypertrophy are in terms of the specific adaptation they represent what I mean by that is when somebody is training for strength what are they really training for obviously it means the ability to move more weight but I know that it includes a number of other things as well and when one is training for hypertrophy for the growth of muscle fibers what does that represent because I think if people understand that they will far better understand the methods and protocols that are going to be best for strength and hypertrophy at its core you've basically described it when we talk about strength we're talking about an actual function so can you create more Force across a muscle or muscle groups or our total movement and when we talk about hypertrophy now we're specifically referring to just an increase in size there's no actual mention of function so a muscle can grow larger without actually technically being stronger for a number of reasons however there is a strong relationship between strength and hypertrophy so a lot of the times in the general public in the lay conversations we sort of lump those two things in it's the same thing and so we have to recognize people who are new to training or people even are intermediately trained there is a huge overlap between strength and our perjury once you get past that though they become disentangled and a good example of it is this if you look at the strongest people in the world this would be people who compete in the sport of power lifting right that's a true test of maximal strength so it is a deadlift a bench press and a back squat and you're going to do a one repetition Max in all three of those and so whoever wins is the person who lifted the most amount of weight one time that's it it's not like World's Strongest Man where it is how many reps can you do in a row or your time right is a true maximal strength test and you compare those to say bodybuilders now both of those individuals are strong and both of those individuals have a lot of muscle however it is extremely clear the power lifters will be significantly stronger than the bodybuilders on average right there are individual exceptions but we're just talking Collective averages and the bodybuilders will have more muscle than the other ones in addition whether you look at Olympic weightlifting or power lifting or world's strongest man for that matter there are weight classes and the reason is as you go up in weight classes you will always see the world records go higher and higher and higher right so you can clearly get stronger without adding any muscle however there's a point right where you simply have to add more mass to get a higher number and that's why we have weight classes in those Sports and in Combat Sports and lots of other things so we have there's a lot of confusion right because people think man either these are the same thing or if I want to get stronger I have to get bigger which is not the case at all another misnomer here is I can't get stronger unless I add muscle that's not true either right it's a similar idea so what I'm saying is you have the ability to do whatever you'd like if you'd like to get stronger and add muscle great if you add muscle you're probably going to bring some strength along for the ride however if you want to get stronger and you don't want to add muscle for any reason personal preference on Aesthetics whether you're in a weight class and you simply can't afford it it is quite easy to get stronger and not add much muscle mass either and so differentiating these two things is one of them is simply a measure of size and the other one is a measure of force and when we talk about strength what we're really talking about are two unique components component one is what I call the physiology so what it what is the ability of the neuromuscular system what is the ability of the muscle fibers to contract and produce Force the other one is what we call mechanics and mechanics is simply things like it's minutia down to how long your femurs are relative to your tibia or or other things like this is biomechanics this is also technique this is skill this is how smooth you feel this is are you firing the right muscle group in the right sequence and Order and all of these things play into strength so somebody who maybe has more Force capability in their muscle fibers but their technique in the movement is worse may lose in a competition or somebody again who's um like if you go into the world of speed and power especially you'll hear a lot of people talk about like the Rhythm and there's just a certain Rhythm that has to happen if you want to jump as high as possible or run as fast as fast as possible but that's all mechanics at this fundamental level so when we look at hypertrophy it's just still simply about how big the muscle is so those are the really the the similarities and distinctions between strength and hypertrophy when strength improves "

            "text": "and when hypertrophy increases is there also involvement in the ligaments and tendons that is of course the ligaments and tendons are involved in the movements and yeah but do ligaments and tendons themselves grow and or get stronger this field is really difficult because connective tissue is not vascular and so their plasticity is significantly lower than skeletal muscle in fact if you look across all the organs a skeletal muscle is one of if not the most plastic meaning it's the most pliable the most responsive the one that's going to adjust it's basically it's paying attention to everything that's being said in the body you cannot change blood pressure or pH or macronutrients floating around without muscle knowing about it it is in fact this is why we call muscle an organ people don't tend to think about this if you were ever on like Jeopardy and they ask you that question like what's the biggest organ system in the body people tend to say the skin muscle is actually the correct answer all right well I'm going to cite you when I get it yeah Jeopardy I don't have any immediate plans to go on Jeopardy but who knows oh there you go Celebrity Jeopardy Angie huberman wait I don't know about the celebrity part but uh Jeopardy would be fun yeah um but I will say the muscle and I'll I'll if you get a phone call in Jeopardy I don't know I haven't seen that show in a very long time yeah uh maybe ever then I'll I'll call you but that makes sense um so that muscles would be the largest organ system in the body the reason I was saying that is so muscle is both listening and talking it is controlling uh the immune system a lot it's controlling blood glucose regulation it is it is the central Depot for uh amino acids which are needed to do things like regulate the immune system build any new red blood cells a lot of this stuff is coming from skeletal muscle so when we say organ by the way that's actually like a physiological definition so something that's communicating uh to either another organ itself or uh throughout the system so it's listening and it's talking connective tissue is not the same way and so we do see adaptations with strength training in connective tissue it's just much lower it's difficult to measure effectively what we know now is you're going to have a combination of adaptations throughout the connective tissue it is beneficial this is probably one of the major reasons that's that strength training reduces injury risk which is very very important because people who tend to want to pick up an exercise routine after say 10 years the classic cliche is like I played all these things in high school then I went to college got a job now I'm 25 or 35 or whatever and you sort of want to jump back into what you did when you were 20. well there's no tissue tolerance left and what we almost always mean by that is connective tissue the tolerance in there is not ready for the load you're about to handle and so you go through some movement and then boom sprains tears um you know even like the more significant ones are on Achilles tear which is going to really sideline you so those are some of the problems and we know strength training as a large role in injury reduction for stress and strain and overuse injuries and that's specifically coming from the connective tissue adaptations again the difficult part here is it's very hard to assess we actually um when I was a doctoral student we played around with patella tendon biopsies so I actually had one this is like a there's a little piece of your patella tendon missing yeah because your own yeah own lab so now I've probably had I don't know how many hundreds of biopsies I've performed on people um probably well over a thousand certainly well over a thousand I've probably had 35 or 40 done in myself there's no problem here I have no Scar Tissue I have no loss of function and I've stuck needles in every leg like all over myself right quads uh my Soleus gastroc like all up taking tissue out yeah you want the needle looks like a pen basically and you you know you're alive and you go in and grab a chunk and you pull it out and can I come to your lab and get biopsy absolutely yeah you're probably looking under the microscope it'll just look like the molecule caffeine there's a there's a mutual friend of ours who came down and did that he's a big big big gentleman big into lifting very into strength training uh and he he went through that experience and he was like oh my gosh it was not what he was hoping to get he actually had unbelievable muscle morphology his fibers were the diameter of muscle fibers is extremely large it's one of the biggest cells by volume in all the biology skeletal muscle and human and how large I can't help myself um millimeters well you so you have length right and then you have width right so lengthwise it can be extraordinarily long you can be the classic example is like your Sartorius which is like the front of your hip to the inside of your kneecap theoretically those cells can run the entire length which would be one muscle fiber running that thing if I were to do a biopsy on you and I and I pulled that tissue out I could actually pull an individual fiber out with tweezers and hold it up and you could see that whole muscle cell yeah I'm definitely not going to get biopsy um you'd be stunned how big they are anyways his was the size of a rhino so the diameter of his now he has a well-documented assistance in the area of muscle growth we'll say um but yeah those can be large so what were we even talking about there well I was asking about tendons and ligaments um because I'd like to understand the various tissues and organ systems that adapt when one gets stronger when muscle tissue grows and I I do want to ask "

            "text": "about bone yeah um and here I'm not referring to Bone mineral density what I was going to ask is whether or not bone itself can grow and get stronger and the reason I'm asking is there's a favorite result of mine I have about 3 800 favorite results 3 000 pet peeves and 3 800 plus favorite results um but one of my favorite results is from Eric kindel's Lab at Columbia Eric won the Nobel Prize for learning and memory and his laboratory got really into the effects of exercise on learning and memory yeah and they had this incredible result which is that load-bearing exercise yeah stimulates the bones to release something called osteocalcin excuse me and then osteocalcin acts as a more or less a hormone travels to the brain and enhances the memory systems in the brain by enhancing neuron Health that's the basic Crux of of the studies there were several of these and The Moment I Saw the first of those studies I thought well here's another reason to do resistance type exercise and not just aerobic exercise and then it brings to mind whether or not bones themselves get stronger when we do resistance training I don't know the answer to that yeah that's very clearly demonstrated and we've known that for for many decades um you have a a diminishing ability to do so with age particularly you need to do this in your teens and 20s this is where you're going to have the largest ability to enhance bone mineral density and it's particularly responsive to axial loading now I'm a muscle guy I'm not a bone specialist so we would have to consult somebody who can give you more position here but that's you explain axial loading it's up and down it's vertical okay so it's almost like a like a cylinder putting the weight of the on the small end of the cylinder on both small end of the cylinders yeah if someone doesn't do this in their 20s or teens however can we assume that some degree of positive change will occur if they do resistance training even if it's a small fraction the answer is yes it is small we have worked with a number of women in our um our rapid health program that come in and they are in their 20s and they're in their 30s and they have significant bone marrow density problems and eight months later we can see noticeable changes that are outside of the measurement error of a positive change positive changes correct and if you worked with the there are many Physicians that specialize in this area you you're going to need a Nutri nutrition here strengthening alone is probably not going to get you there particularly with women because you have to figure out why and and there's a lot going on with the physiology and biochemistry so you probably like almost surely needed to have some blood chemistry done with that you have to figure out what's going on menstrual cycle wise in fact like oftentimes what we'll do for our women very specifically is we use a thing called The Rhythm plus a 30-day test so you can actually do a salivary test across the entire menstrual cycle and you can take uh samples it's about every other day so you get 15 or 16 samples and you get a really beautiful picture of what's Happening hormonally across the entire menstrual cycle and that's really really important because typically for women if you get a single sample or simple time Point whether it's salivary urine or blood you can have um well like a order of magnitude difference in any number of metrics because of what phase are in this is one of the many reasons why it's been such a challenge to do a lot of physiology research with females some metrics change throughout the menstrual cycle others don't like strength is a very good example I can strengthen and I can do a one rep max test on a woman at any point I don't have to do that at a certain phase of their menstrual cycle because it's the evidence I think is pretty clear at this point that number won't change so I have no qualms including female files in any of my studies where strength is an absolute is an important dependent variable because I don't have to adjust around menstrual cycle other factors like anything in in blood anything hormone related you're going to have to automatically account for it so what I would say is those folks should absolutely work with a qualified physician and you you're going to have to get some nutrition supplementation potentially and then maybe even some other stuff going on to make that even more complicated if you're on any form of birth control or not that's going to change the entire equation especially if it's a hormone-based birth control so it just gets really really complicated to answer it though you can see adaptations they are significantly diminished relative to if you would have started in your teens and 20s but there is hope you just need to work with somebody who specializes in that area so for both men and women boys and girls "

            "text": "what are the major adaptations that occur to underlie improvements in strength and if you would if you could just provide a bullet point list of that and then we can dive into each of those in detail for instance are nerves getting more efficient at firing our bones enjoying adaptations in different yeah bone connective tissue relationships that that underlie strength I have to imagine all these things are happening but what are the the major changes that are occurring in those Origins and organ systems that reflect someone's ability to on one day lift you know 100 pounds and then a week later to lift uh 105 pounds now I'll try to keep this condensed again this could be an entire University course I will also try to give you a little bit of Bones here so normally as a muscle guy I only I take all the credit and muscle turns out the nervous system gets a little bit of credit too here thank you so as we walk through it just in as a big picture if we think about again what causes human movement basically everything along that chain will improve the strength training and I'm not really being using too much hyperbole there it's quite impressive so it's going from the nervous system side of the equation what has to happen for human movement is a nerve has to send a signal through a motor unit now a motor unit is comes down and interface multiple muscle fibers so if you think about your actual muscle it's not a thing it is a component of many individual muscle fibers so you've got millions if not more think of it like a ponytail so we collectively say ponytail and you think of it as like one thing but really a ponytail is a combination of tons of individual hairs okay muscles the same way so this motor unit comes in and innervates a lot of different muscle fibers now every one of the fibers in a motor unit is generally of the same fiber type so fast switch or slow twitch and they are not laid out next to each other in the muscle they are spread out across horizontally vertically as well as closer to the Bone and further to the surface so they're moved throughout the entire way and this is what allows you to have smoother contractions and you don't have spasticity and things like that so we see improvements from the neuromuscular side like firing rate we see synchronization improvements um that are coming in you also see improvements in things like acetylcholine release from the presynaptic neuron so you're getting it faster we see calcium recycling is improved back uh to there so in order for without walking into too much of the biochemistry in order for a signal to go from nerve to muscle there's a little bit of a gap there's a physical space that happens and what happens is you release this molecule called acetylcholine this goes into the postsynaptic left and then that actually binds to a receptor that receptor actually opens up a door that lets sodium in that's really what's happening so it's not the acetylcholine without acetylcholine then sits on that receptor site it's broken down put back in and recycled back up in the presynaptic nerve site the faster you can do that the faster you can recycle that signal and so almost everything that I describe in that entire system improves and has been shown to to increase with training so that alone is given to give you benefits we haven't even walked into to getting from an electrical signal now into an action potential which is going to cause a muscle contraction so getting from nerve into the muscle we see everything from improvements when we call contractility which means the muscle fiber themselves can produce more force or more velocity independent of muscle size changes this is another component when we ask like well how is it I got stronger without getting bigger well in the muscle fiber itself its ability to contract Force increases and this is because we have everything like the sarcoplasmic reticulum which is the place that stores and releases the calcium which is what's needed for this entire cross-bridge interaction from the myosin and actin to happen I know a lot I just lost a lot of people but you can go look at some of these images the sarcoplasmatricium gets gets activated more it gets more sensitive it is better at releasing calcium bringing it back in and doing it again the bond between the crossbridge the myosin actin gets stronger the calcium Affinity is the phrase that we use there increases so we're literally walking through almost the entire process of skeletal muscle contraction here and every step along the way we we see improvements so that net result is we see again more Force production independent of any change in size independent of any increase in contractile units we didn't add anything to the equation we didn't change size we did nothing but improve efficiency effectively independent of that now we can actually start talking about changing muscle fiber type so we can change our fibers from a slow twitch fiber to a fast twitch fiber that alone is going to give you more forced production again independent of size fast switch fibers 10 to be larger than Soul touch fibers but not always especially in the presence of endurance training so if you do a lot of consistent endurance training it's very common for us to find slow touch fibers that are as similar size if not larger often very often larger than those fast touch fibers if you take slow fibers big slow very metabolically effective vibrous so extremely fatigue resistant so it's not a bad thing to call them slow is like we tend to say fastest low and slow has this negative connotation but it's like quite healthy like fiber type to have outside of that now we haven't even gotten into things like penation angle so this is an angle at which your muscle fibers interact with your bone so we tend to think about this as like a muscle fiber is pulling on a muscle well some some of these are oriented are almost a 90 degree so a fiber runs perpendicular into the bone and some of them are closer to like a 45 degree and some of them are closer to almost parallel and that confers a lot of unique mechanical benefits so in one area it's actually going to increase Force production you go the other direction increases velocity and so we have all kinds of changes in the angle at which the muscle inserts into the bone now we're already on the mechanic side of it right so we've we've influenced how effectively it pulls and with any of these things it's always a give and take so you're going to give up in the case of a Nation angle you're going to give up strength but you're going to increase of a lot shortening velocity or if you want to increase the velocity you're going to give up sort of the strength right we haven't gotten to any of the energetics at all so we haven't talked about increasing storage of phosphocreatine which is the energy system needed to power that muscle contraction at the fastest possible rate so we can continue to go as long as you want here but hopefully you're getting the point of a little bit of the adaptations that occur the reason I want to actually why I think that stuff is important to bring it back maybe for some Muslims I know I took you on a journey there and you're just like what the hell just happened that matters because again this is the specific explanation for how is it possible that I got stronger but I didn't get bigger and this is also why strength and hypertrophy are intertwined and heavily overlapped but are not necessarily the same thing so for example we can increase muscle size and actually reduce strength because of what's called lattice spacing so what happens is you have to kind of remember your muscle fibers are these long cylinders and the way that they contract requires an optimal space and so what happens is you have this molecule called actin and you have this molecule called myosin myosin sits in the middle and there are six actin that surround each individual myosin in a three-dimensional Circle here so you got a myosin in the middle that has all these globular heads and they can reach up and grab man acting and again there's six sort of around them right um well one of the things that can occur is if those those actin are too close together so I imagine my hands um I'm reaching out and doing a giant T right so I'm horizontal out there well if my fingertips are the tips of the myosin and I'm trying to reach up and grab an actin and I want to pull those actins closer to my face well those act and stack on top of each other and that's what actually makes your muscles grow up like if I flex my bicep it actually you know grows up three or four inches because you're stacking these these sarcomeres or what they're called on top of each other all right great well if I'm reaching out to grab them and the muscle is stretched too far I can't actually make that strong of a connection it would be like if I reached out and grabbed something but I can only reach my longest fingertip on it when I go to contract I can't make that strong of a contraction because my grip is weak my grip's gonna break before I reach my strength limit if I'm too close there's nowhere to go I'm already as close so if you actually disrupt that lattice spacing too much you can actually lose a little bit of strength so it's not that getting bigger will ever make you weaker it's simply that you're not optimizing for strength You're simply optimizing for size and so that can that can explain a little bit of the of the disconcurity between growing and performance I'd like to take a brief break and "

breathing as well so-called Zone 2 ish cardio will I see an increase in protein in synthesis as simply as a consequence of that jog now this is one of the unique factors of strength training you're not going to say that in fact you would it's difficult to measure protein breakdown that's been as extraordinarily challenging to do in the laboratory but you're not going to see those benefits in fact you're going to see quite the opposite it's an entire molecular Cascade so this is kind of how it works so you have to have some sort of signal on the outside and this can be an energetic signal so this could be glucose uptake it could be protein intake it could be a physical stretch what happens is on the cell wall there is some sort of it could be testosterone right testosterone could bind to beta adrenergic receptors and this activates a whole series of Cascades of signaling proteins and these proteins basically play a game of telephone so one tells the next one this is the next one and I sort of walk this entire way well that molecular Cascade is fundamentally the same thing with regardless of the insult but they're different Pathways and so the pathway from strength training or protein ingestion is going to go to the same nucleus it's going to activate a whole set of Gene Cascades that are going to tell you to to go through this entire process of protein synthesis which I'll walk through what that is in a second if you do endurance training it's a different pathway and so instead of activating this entire thing of like mtor and akt and this is anabolic signaling Cascade it's going to do a different one which you can think of more of like as ampk an energy signaling thing so there's a crossover Point here in fact one of the things you'll notice is mtor and akt don't really influence ampk but there is some literature that years ago showed ampk will activate another protein called tsc2 and that will actually inhibit mtor and that was the first molecular explanation for the quote-unquote interference effect of endurance training on hypertrophy could you just take a highlight for people what this is because as you describe these signaling Pathways I just want to um maybe just put a top Contour explanation the mtor pathway is synonymous with cell growth yeah both during development as organisms humans included mature and cells get larger mtor's abundant in the system to put it quite simply and then the ampk pathway and some of the metabolic signaling that you're referring to is more synonymous with cardiovascular exercise in this at least in the context of this discussion and fuel utilization yep and what you described as a crossover point where certain forms of exercise can tap into both of these yep but at least for sake of this conversation we're largely separating them yeah because the the byproduct is the thing that uh that matters here so the result of uh mtor and akt getting into the nucleus is going to be increased in protein synthesis the result of ampk running down to the mind is going to be result in increasing mitochondrial biogenesis so the net outcome is different now I do want to flag it very quickly this is an extraordinarily complicated thing and um in fact in our laboratory we were able to to be one of the first that figured out how to measure all the different subunits of ampk and individual muscles by fiber type so because you're ripping people's muscles out of their knees and their patellar tendons uh so anxious teasing they're they're gently removing with under IRB protocol of course um so even when we say something like ampk it's not one thing Amy we say things like mtor it's not one thing either it is you have the total amount that matters you have the activation the activation sites or many of them so it's not a simple um as what I'm laying it on I just wanna a big concept of kind of what's Happening Here to actually kind of answer your question which is okay so how is the muscle actually growing what you have to understand is is a little bit of how um protein synthesis occurs so what I'm generally meaning is you have a whole bunch of amino acids and this actually goes back to maybe like middle school biology class right so if you take a bunch of amino acids and you combine them together we get these things called a peptide right and if anyone who's ever heard of like peptides that's all it really means you put a bunch of those together you have a poly peptide you put a bunch of those together and we now have a protein so any protein I want to make is going to go through the exact same system the exact same steps it doesn't matter if that protein is going to be a red blood cell it doesn't matter if that's going to be a hair follicle doesn't matter if it's going to be skeletal muscle that's basically protein synthesis so when we tend to think of protein synthesis we we just paint this picture of growing more muscle and that's not the only thing and so when we talk about the benefits of having high quality muscle as being this place that's going to regulate most of your protein synthesis we tend to lose some people because they're thinking oh I don't need to gain muscle and that's not what we're talking about we're talking about regulating the immune system or regular we're talking about regulating any protein turnover so any Protein that's degradated or needs to be broken down in your in your system at all autophagy this is the end like this is such an important buzzword um that's just protein breakdown of an unneeded or damaged protein right that whole thing is going to go through protein synthesis to be able to come back and replace the things the only reason you go through autophagy so you can clean that garbage out and then come back and build in a more properly functioning protein so it's not just about growing more muscle mass it's why you want these systems to be operating well so the protein ingestion is going to just activate that Cascade because it's basically saying oh hey look we have an abundance of Supply here why don't we make something out of it because we don't know the next time this thing is going to be around carbohydrates and fat are very easy to store protein is very challenging it's more transient and so you can store some of it and keep it around but most of it you're going to lose and so when it's available your body wants to act very quickly it doesn't necessarily care if you have extra fat floating around in your system it's all right let's package it up and store it we can easily bring this back out but if you've got protein around you're going to want to use it and so that's why it alone will activate and increase protein synthesis independent of exercise so those effects are additive like I said because that signaling process is independent and once you hit a rate limiting phase then it you are you're there but at its onset those things will work independently okay so that being said what is skeletal muscle hypertrophy in general we think "

            "text": "about it as this increase in contractile proteins so those myosin and actin effectively get thicker okay now what happens is since they are thicker and as I talked about a second ago that influences and actually hurts the lattice spacing and so what your body does as a result is say hey let's increase the diameter of the entire cell so that we can maintain our spacing between these things right it's effectively like if you know the two of us were sitting in this room and you doubled in size and I was like well you're in my personal space like and I doubled in size now we're in each other's space the at some point we just have to make the room larger and that's exactly what's happening in the cell and so as you can continue to increased muscle size you're going to get a muscle myofibular accretion you're going to continue to increase muscle fiber size for years there was this other comment about non-functional hypertrophy and this is often called sarcoplasmic hypertrophy now this is not sarcoplasm particular this is a fancy way of saying my muscle is larger but it has no function and the question would be why the hell is that possible if I have more contractile units and I can make more of these cross Bridges perform more of these power strokes this is what these contractions are called how could I possibly be losing function well that was challenged for that was Bro Science for a very very long time in fact what it really came down to was are there different types of hypertory training some that induce contractile protein hypertrophy and some that induce the sarcoplasmic hypertree and that was the significantly challenged until recently Mike Roberts did at Auburn did a series of wonderful studies that showed quite clearly that sarcoposmic hypertrophy is probably happening and in fact there's probably a pretty easy explanation in general what happens is it is it is a increase in fluid in the muscle fiber and so this would allow for the diameter to be larger but since there's no addition of contractile units no more forced production happens and so he actually has a wonderful review paper I believe it's open access where you can go look and he created a wonderful graph um I think that's in my hypertrophy videos on YouTube as well and you can actually see that it's likely happening in phasic changes throughout your training experience so at the beginning of your training but as as the years and year or weeks rather than months and then eventually years go by in your training we have a change in the hypertrophy that's coming from contractile units versus sarcoplastic so I think that is an important note because again people are wondering like how the hell is it even possible for me to get larger muscle and somehow I'm not stronger well if it came from Simply fluid retention and this is not bloating this is not there's no negative really to this it is simply holding a more hydration in the cell diameter gets larger and then everything works that way what you just described calls to mind something similar in the nervous system which is neuroplasticity which of course is the nervous system's ability to change in response to learning and experience and damage for that matter yep and we think about it as one term but there are many different forms of neuroplasticity a discussion that we don't need to get into now but there's Spike timing dependent plasticity and ltp and long-term depression which has nothing to do with psychological depression and on and a pair pulse facilitation and on and on and on in short-term elasticity and so what I'm starting to understand is that there are many paths to what we call strength increase and there are many paths to what we think of as hypertrophy many of these are going to operate in parallel it's going to be rare that any one of them is going to be active alone in order to create hypertrophy or strength changes and that certain forms of exercise and certain ways of doing exercises in terms of sets and repetition schemes and rest intervals between sets and between training sessions are going to tap into different mechanisms but also overlapping sets of mechanisms which is why if I understand correctly you mentioned at the beginning that often not always but often strength increases are associated with some hypertrophy changes and hypertrophy increases are often not always associated with strength increases do I have that right correct and the beauty of this whole thing is while we don't "

            "text": "yet know the mechanisms specifically and there's a lot of Confusion And there's a lot of changes that happen there's uh we actually just submitted a paper a few days ago um my stuff uh Jimmy Bagley at San Francisco and Kevin murick at uh one has a wonderful muscle physiology Lab at Arkansas and we we actually this is a very late article actually it's incredibly easy to read um we describe the the role of myonucleation in uh muscle my per tree and there's actually a lot of energy stuff we get into there but um we're learning more and more about it uh as a quick example so skeletal muscle is unique in the fact that it is so large in diameter it's also unique in the fact it's multinucleated what that means is typically in biology you see like a cell has one nucleus that's the place that houses and holds the DNA and it's the control center that was a degro shrink die repair that whole thing well skeletal muscle and human is awesome because it has thousands if not more there's nuclei which gives it that plasticity and so a normal cell has one place it has to go to for any time it wants to upregulate down regulate do whatever the thing is your muscle fibers have these little control centers all throughout them and for years we were like okay great the amount of hypertrophy that you can experience is probably limited by the amount of nuclei you have because you're not going to exceed a certain size of muscle fiber if that's going to mean you lose control and so we're like okay great we found and identified a limiting factor to what will determine how much a muscle can actually grow and then the next question was and then where are these things coming from and this is where satellite cells come in and so it was very clear a satellite cell that's lying dormant sort of on the outside the periphery of the fiber will then go in um into the into the fibroid will turn into a myonuclei and then it can actually you know increase your diameter like that and so then actually it was like hey you're actually limited by the amount of these satellite cells you can get in and turn into nuclear and then the evidence came out that showed hey what if you D train so what if I used to lift weights like a long time ago and I got big but now I've lost a lot of my muscle if I train again you actually get that muscle back faster than it took you the very first time to build it like that's what we call muscle memory like in our film now on your side equation muscle memory is something different rights and nervous when people talk about muscle memory um like the ability to ride a bicycle after so many years of not having tried to ride one that's actually largely independent of the muscle it has something to do with exclusively Independence it's basically a nervous system phenomenon 100 so muscle memory uh has been co-opted by different communities to mean different things yeah so on our side muscle memory is going to mean that ability to remember that muscle size right that hypertrophy because as you explained the motor control thing is that it's a totally a nerve thing that's the one I'll give you this one right you guys the nerve people can have this one well it seems to me that there are a tremendous number of parallels between strength and hypertrophy changes and neuroplasticity this is coming up again and again in this conversation um because we know for instance that if you are exposed to a couple of different languages early on in life you will learn any number of different languages far more easily later in life of course and that's because there's some crossover between different languages especially Latin based languages that allows for that there's a substrate for it it's similar to the the ability to hop on a bicycle again phenomenon or play an instrument phenomenon but it's broader than that and again I think this speaks to the huge number of different adaptive changes that are occurring in the cells and in the nerves that innervate these cells when one experiences increases in strength and hypertrophy so to round that out um and to go back to what I was saying there what we're actually learning now is that nucleation thing and by the way this entire trajectory story is probably over the last like eight years like this is how fast we've changed our understanding of how muscle grows uh the sarcoplasmic reticulum thing five years ago was was Bro Science now it's it's pretty well established the mononucleation thing was eight to ten years ago it's changing every week this paper we just submitted this week showed actually why we had generally thought a few years ago and in fact you can find me on podcasts and probably in some of my videos talking about this and I'm going to tell you right now those things are wrong like we've just had new things come out these last couple years where that D training effect we thought was a reason of well what happens is if you had the muscle before and you've brought in these nuclei and they differentiated and turned into into nuclei and then the muscle got small again you would preserve those nuclei and that's why when you go to train again they were already around so the muscle grows faster the second time they did the first time well now it looks like that's actually not the case in fact it's actually probably hap what's happening is it's a it's a epigenetic change in the nuclei's ability to access the DNA needed to grow muscle it's effectively the analogy we used it's the nuclei are remembering how to ride a bike so it's quite funny that you said that because it's not really necessarily that they're being preserved over time they have learned the sequence it takes to grow the protein there and it goes it happens faster the second time and we've also learned that there are specific nuclei we've known this for actually a while we found this in our lab and we didn't Discover it we just we saw this in our sum of our Harbors but there are different shapes the nuclei some are more oval some are more elongated and the shape determines a lot of the functions some of them are hanging out more towards the periphery and some of them are hanging out right around the nucleus well it looks like there's actually probably different types of nuclei a lot of them that are specific to the mitochondria in fact you can see like on some of the Imaging we have you're just like they're just packed around the the ma the mitochondria and there are some that are probably specific to injury repair and so this is probably explaining a lot of the the individual variation I mean I know you've you've said previously like you're just a very you're very slow at recovery there's a lot of things that go into that and I would I would love to walk through sort of all the buckets uh maybe later into recovery but one of the inherent genetic variations this could be simply that you maybe have more or less of the nuclei responsible for tissue repair um that's something that's been happening in the last like handful of months that's been coming out we'll see if that holds up as true or not um so as we're learning more and more almost every day about muscle physiology what's super fun and interesting and I think the most exciting what to do in order in terms of like how to train and how to eat and how to do everything else to get these adaptations has been pretty well established for a long long time we're just figuring out how like what's happening in the muscle now but we know what to do so from a practical standpoint putting together protocols for any outcome that you want or don't want for any modality you don't have a gym you have uh weights you have dumbbells only you only have kettlebells you don't want to you only use body weight we can you only have three days a week you have seven days a week you wanna maximize muscle growth you want to get a Little Bit Stronger any of these variables you want to throw at me we have a large evidence base for exactly how to get those adaptations and not others so while we have a lot to learn about the mechanisms and the physiology we have pretty good legs to stand on in terms of what to do to get whatever adaptations you want so what are the essential components of an effective strength and "

            "text": "hypertrophy protocol okay so what I would like to actually do is is walk you through both of those because as we mentioned before they overlap but the training needs to be differentiated so that you can optimize either strength hypertrophy or if you actually want you can get a combination of both this allows you to then get the adaptation you want avoid ones you don't want and then get it even a combination if that's the preference so a lot of people will talk about I want to get a little stronger I want to add some muscle that's a different answer than someone who wants to truly maximize muscle which is a different answer from somebody who maximizes wants to maximize strength which is a different answer from somebody wants to Max my strength but not actually gain muscle so we have all these combinations what's important to understand before we get into the details there's a couple of things number one we've been teasing this concept so far of the concepts are few but the methods are many and so I want to hit those Concepts right now these are as you as you say these are the non-negotiables that have to happen in any training program and I'm referring to these in the strength and I particular conversation but these are true of power development speed development muscular endurance uh endurance any other thing these are things that just have to happen for any training program to work I mentioned one uh a little bit earlier which was adherence and so that my frequent collaborator Dan Garner will constantly say consistency beats intensity um again in fact the literature will show you very clearly inherence um is the number one predictor of physical fitness outcomes so we want to do something that you will engage in we'll uh you'll put effort into and you'll be able to repeat consistently over time so that's number one the second one is and this is a major reason that people don't hit their fitness goals in fact I would argue outside of not doing it the number one mistake they make is Progressive overload so I'm going to walk you through exactly how much you should be increasing um your sets and Reps and weight Etc per week per month later but that's the biggest thing you have got to have some sort of overload the body works as an adaptation mechanism right so in fact we talked previously about the Harvard fatigue lab and one of the things actually people don't realize is the concept of homeostasis is actually comes from research of the Harvard fatigue lab it was um work that they did on an endurance Runner I forget his name and they sort of realized that after a long period of time working out this is an acute exercise spell the body actually comes back to some stable place despite the fact he was continuing to work and that's exactly what bore the phrase steady state and that actually then they launched off and said wow there's this state that the body wants to be in and we'll call this homeostasis so those all Concepts came out of exercise physiology which is really really cool right um we don't get a lot of love a lot of times scientifically but that's a good one that we took so why that all matters is we have got to achieve some sort of overload without uh going excess so we'll cover that later uh exactly what to do and we'll potentially get into over training and monitoring and mattering things like that but you have to have some sort of consistent predictable overload that's what's going to cause adaptation to continue to cause stress if you don't do that you can still do things like burn calories you can still get some of the other benefits of exercise like improved mood cognitive function etc etc flexibility increases all those can happen without a progressive overload but if you want to see these gains in strength and hypertrophy you really need to progressively overload so that's concept number two the third one here is going to be individualization and this is where we can get into things like personal preference you know equipment availability you have kettlebells or dumbbells you only have bands we have none of that these are all smaller details but that's an important component to it the last one I really want to get into is picking the appropriate Target and we went through this when we talked about the fitness protocol and and if you run through something like that and you run some testing and figure out where your biggest limitations are that's going to help you identify where you need to go so if you can do all those things you're going to be in a good spot to balance specificity and variation all right so if you want to make sure you grow your biceps you better make sure your biceps are working having said that if you over rely on specificity you're going to increase the likelihood of overuse injuries which is going to come back and actually hamper consistency over time all right so this is when hedging towards specificity is important but too much can cause a problem if you go the other direction and you go with too much variation so imagine you're just sort of doing all kinds of different exercises every time you you work out that's actually not enough stimuli directly on the muscle or muscle groups or movement pattern if you're wanting to learn a new movement um to get you very far and so this is a classic problem of I'm doing a lot of work but I don't have a very clear Direction I lack specificity so I'm working but I'm not seeing a lot of improvements and this is like in the business World Etc this is like doing a whole bunch of different things means you get nothing really done so that's the game we're gonna play here right how do we overload this stuff how do we make sure we're balancing specificity and variation how do we make sure I want to do this and then how do I individualize it for my needs and circumstances and and movement restrictions and of time availability and my calendar and desires and all these things so those are the concepts we absolutely have to hit the methods that we choose run across a handful of variables and we call these things modifiable variables because as you modify them or you make different choices within these variables you get different outcomes or adaptations this is exactly what determines the nine adaptations that we've been talking about so the way that I like to say this is exercises do not determine adaptation so you can't simply go I want to get stronger therefore I'm going to choose these exercises that's not how it works what determines adaptation is the execution of the exercises so a deadlift is my favorite example a deadlift is a common example that people think of when they want to choose a lower body strength exercise but a deadlift will not increase your strength unless you're executing it in the proper fashion I'm not even talking about technique here I'm talking about these modifiable variables the same thing for power exercises we'll commonly see mistakes of doing uh activities like a box jump which is great people think oh I'm going to improve my power which we know is extremely highly correlated to activities of daily living and particularly living unassisted as you age right is reduction in power so they'll do an activity like a box jump what they're failing to realize is unless you do it powerfully you won't actually increase power if you don't move fast you won't get faster so the the way that we manipulate these variables is everything to determining the adaptation you get or again don't get so with that Foundation I think we can kind of run right into these things and we can start off with perhaps speed and power and what I would like to do is walk you through all those modifiable variables what to do with them and then hit you with as many different methodologies as we really have time for and then we'll move on to strength and hypertrophy and kind of round the entire thing out and then maybe at the end we can talk some other variables like what happens if I have a training protocol and I'm halfway through and I can't finish my workout what should I do reduce my weight or reduce my duration or things like that so there's lots of what-if scenarios that we can go through that potentially a lot of people listening have questions about so sound like a plan sounds like a plan I'd like to take a brief break to "

            "text": "in mind the proper nine adaptations that we've been referring to and that were discussed in detail in episode one I have listed number one skill and technique number two speed number three power which is speed times Force number four strength number five hypertrophy number six muscular endurance number seven anaerobic capacity number eight maximal aerobic capacity and number nine long duration steady state exercise yep you nailed it thank you for for that it was probably important clarification for everybody um so that being said let's jump right into speed and power now I'll do these a little bit simultaneously they are different if you're a high performance athlete you really need to separate these two things for the most people that we can probably think about them is is the same thing there's not a lot of pure speed training that the general public is is interested in um if you want to actually further break down speed there are multiple components there's acceleration there's top end velocity there's change of direction or agility and things like that so we'll just kind of call All That speed and power for now now at the onset there's this three to five concept that we talked about many times where this is really fairly true for speed power or strength now I I didn't develop the three to five it's just an easy way to help you remember one concept that will run true across all these things so three to five it refers to three to five days per week uh pick three to five exercises and you're gonna do three to five repetitions per set you'll do three to five sets and you'll rest three to five minutes between each set if you do that and you execute any of the exercises that you choose at a high intent and that part is critical you don't get faster by moving kind of fast you can't improve Power by moving like and powerfully you have to be trying regardless of whether actually moving faster or not anytime you're talking about speed or power you're by definition using sub maximal weights so you're going to be able to lift it that's not the question the question is how fast can you lift that Implement and so intention is incredibly important so if you do that the same for strength by the way so if you land on that that allows you to run the gamut from as little as three days a week you're doing a three exercises you're gonna do three sets of three which is a very very low volume it's a a very low amount of days easy to handle all the way to five sets of five of five exercises five days a week so it it's again it's just one sample that's something easy to remember and is quite effective for a very long time and this has been tested quite extensively in in both the coaching Realms as well as the scientific Realms to be quite productive and easy to follow and grasp if you do that all you need to do is slightly increase the load or the volume but mostly the load over time and the number we want to look for there is something like a three to five percent increase per week so an example would be if you're going to do an exercise at 100 pounds you can't necessarily just add five pounds every week that's going to touch you pretty quickly and so you may have to run some a smaller increment if you're doing like a lower body exercise where you might have a couple of hundred pounds on the weight you can probably get away with adding five pounds because it's still a low percentage of the total load so that's roughly uh the guide that we want to get to for speed power and strength so that sounds incredibly simple and effective yet I have a number of questions first off if somebody is using the three to five approach does that mean they should not be doing any other weight training of any kind in those workouts or at all no you can certainly do that in combination with anything else you would like especially if you think about speed and power those are very non-fatiguing and so if you can imagine you're going to go to the beach and you're going to take a 10 pound to 20 pound medicine ball with you and you're going to do you know four different exercises or you're throwing the medicine ball as high as you can in the air four times in a row taking a break and you two or three hits that you do maybe three or four different types of throws that's very good for improving power extremely good but it's not very fatiguing so you could certainly finish that workout in 20 minutes and then run on and then do any number of other things so you could do some high intensity and aerobic capacity work you could do steady state stuff you could you could even do hypertrophy on top of that so there's a there's two major categories of what we call periodization there's there's many many of them but the two that have the most scientific literature are what's called linear periodization and another is called undulating or often daily undulating periodization and I'm flagging these two again despite the fact there are many many more because they represent two different concepts which you actually just touched upon so linear periodization is a hallmarked by basically saying we're going to train one adaptation at a time so imagine going say six to eight weeks and you're only doing strength or you're only doing hypertrophy you're endurance for that matter so in that particular case you you would not do anything else in combination if you contrast that to undulating periodization you would actually be doing multiple different styles of training even with either within the same day or just different days so it could be Monday is power Wednesday is strength Friday's hypertrophy whatever or it could be a little bit of strength every single day a little bit I perch for every day a little bit of power every day and you would just change the amount of each that you do within the day to alter the emphasis all right now if you look at the studies and there have been many uh rcts on this the result of both of these training programs is generally basically the same thing they are equally effective here's the major difference though one if your goal is very specific to one outcome you want a hedge toward specificity so if you're like hey I'm trying to maximize the amount of muscle I can build in the next eight weeks then you don't really anything else besides that is just distraction and potential interference does it really matter or not it doesn't matter but it's not helping anything else so linear periodization is is fundamental at providing focus and therefore the the adaptations tend to be oftentimes larger in that specific area that downside is you now go six to eight to ten weeks of doing nothing else and so you were losing those other adaptations that are great at a faster rate and you can imagine doing something like speed work only again speed work by definition is non-fatiguing so when oftentimes we think of speed work it's like oh I did ladder drills and I did all these things and like I threw up at the end that's not speed work you just did a different type of endurance training okay which is great and important so true speed work is very high rest very low fatigue and actually truly trying to reach a new level of speed or velocity so non-fatiguing if you did that exclusively for 10 weeks you would be pretty unfit by the end of it because you did you would also lose a decent amount of muscle mass not because there's an interference effect but simply because the fact you have not stimulated muscle growth for eight to ten weeks and so neither one of these is better than the other we're going to see this classically across all program design or periodization strategies is it's just a it's a give and take there are tons of different systems and and perhaps at the end we can talk about some of the more advanced periodization Styles these ones are are both effective you could do these with beginners you could do these with Advanced athletes you can do them any Spectrum but they're they're some of the more well-documented ones it's just a pro and con game right it's what are you willing to give up the way that you solve that problem is going back to that fitness assessment and your analysis and really truly understanding what your goal is is your goal to do a little bit of strength and a little bit okay great maybe undulated periodization is an approach if your goal is really to maximize strength and maybe you can wait on putting some muscle mass on maybe a linear periodization is a better report or another style of periodization that's optimal for strength gain so it's just simply about addressing your things one of the major problems folks have in addition to lacking Progressive overload is they don't have any foresight past the next day of the training right and so it's really important that you set off blocks that are anywhere between six to 12 weeks long where you're going to have the specific plan ideally you have an idea for the whole year I actually have like a structure I could walk you through for that but even if you don't have that really think about what you want the next 12 weeks and then maybe the next 12 weeks after that and that's going to give you a lot of guidance about what to do and what to focus on terrific what about warming up I was taught that one should do higher "

            "text": "repetition movements with lighter weights in order to warm up and then one of the things that did make a big positive difference for me in terms of strength and hypertrophy training was to do a moderate repetition warm-up with a fairly lightweight but then to actually keep the number of warm-up repetitions fairly low and work progressively toward the first so-called work set when you say three to five that's three to five work sets correct yep are you also going to tell me three to five warm-ups no are you also going to tell me it has to be done between three and five pm so in terms of five friends in all seriousness uh what does a good warm-up look like yeah and I realize this will vary depending on how cool your training environment is time of day Etc but as a kind of umbrella for a good warm-up okay what should people do the you've already sort of jumped the gun with with my answer it it is honestly very dependent upon the person so some folks respond very well to a minimum work well others I've had lots of actually um professional fighters I've worked with where they'll actually have a major league baseball player right now he's one of the best pitchers in the game probably the best and the longer we warm up the better his numbers get we actually did a vertical jump test with him he's gonna kill me because he got so mad uh I wanted to see how long it sort of took him to reach a peak vertical jump and most times this takes people something like five to ten sort of reps and I said take it up all the way to a maximum vertical jump and then what I want you to do is continue to Jumping until you have three consecutive jumps or you're down lower than 90 percent and so what we're trying to look at is sort of when is he going to break because in baseball he's going to throw like 100 pitchers or so and we're trying to figure out when is his Peak velocity on his fastball gonna drop and sort of basis conditioning on that so it's a different style of conditioning it's power endurance is really what it is um he called me in the middle of it I'm like oh you're done whatever and he's just like no like how many of these am I supposed to do and I was like what are you talking about he's like I'm on rep 130 or something and I was like what and I'm like what rep did you peek on he peeked on rep 70. something like that 69 I think technically because he's goofy um so he's a classic example I've worked in for many many years we have a ton of data on him a ton of biological data a ton of um neural muscular stuff like all kinds of stuff and it just the more he warms up an absurd amount of warm-up the better he gets and the better he gets in power production and the better he gets in speed and velocity so his warm-up prior to games is it's totally absurd and just the more volume we throw at him the better he does I have other folks you get past like two or three reps and fatigue starts to set in and now you're actually like reducing power production so there is a ton of variation that goes in that I can give you some guidelines though you need to differentiate if you're training for speed power strength or hypertrophy here's why if we understand a little bit about what's causing the adaptation that's going to tell you what you need to do or avoid for example volume is the primary driver in hypertrophy intensity is the primary driver in speed power and strength all right which what that means is you need to preserve intensity for the first three you need to preserve volume in the second one at most so if your warm-up is so extensive in the hypertrophy training that it compromises your training volume because of fatigue even if it compromises the last set of the last exercise then you're actually probably walking yourself backwards by doing that extensive you would have been better off starting your first working set slightly sub-optimal right because it's not really you're just trying to accrue volume at that point strength Empower is the opposite until you're moving very very fast or powerfully you're not really causing the adaptation so there's no point of starting your working set until you're really basically at a hundred percent so the warm-up should be as long as it takes you to get to where your Mobility is in the right spot like your joints feel good you feel fresh you feel activated and you really feel Peak power anything before that is a warm-up set in the sport of Olympic weightlifting a lot of times the coaches will measure barbell velocity Travis Mash has done a fantastic job with this he's got a lot of data on what's called velocity-based training I'm Brian Mann at Missouri and Miami tons of work here and generally those communities are not going to count any repetition as a working set until you exceed 70 of your one rep max where that's changed because of a lot of people doing the velocity-based stuff is now they're basing that simply on an achieved velocity and so really the warm-up is irrelevant they don't even it's sort of just like do whatever you want and we're going to measure the barbell until you actually hit an outcome and now you're at what a working set um so different ways to think about it um depending on what you're training for that'll give you a little bit of a guideline if you're training for anything past hypertrophy then really and especially even hypertrophy it just comes down to are you feeling um ready to work are you cold are you moving to the correct positions and if all those things are fine I don't care if you start a little bit early and save some gas then especially if you're a person like you who may be a bit more inclined to fatigue quickly relative to Trevor who's just has no response to fatigue whatsoever is it useful to do more warm-up at the beginning of a workout say before the first exercise and then once one has achieved both local and systemic warm-up in air quotes um then perhaps on the second or third exercise fourth exercise Etc one or maybe even zero warm-ups yeah fair point we generally think about warm-ups in a couple of ways this is a really actually this is a very clever question you want to have some sort of General Global warm-up scheme we tend to prefer Dynamic warm-ups so this is whole body movements rather than like sitting and stretching static stretching things like that so something that involves momentum yeah momentum or movement right so this is like uh think about this in like old gym class it's like your high knees and your butt kickers and just different things like that where you're moving in different planes you're moving joints through tons of range of motion you're getting a lot of movement there so you're getting the local warm-up you're also getting the the total systemic activation everything else is going on there so that is what we consider to be a general warm-up five minutes is a very sufficient number perhaps 10 if you're a slow goer achy and some things like that and you really got to get the ankle warmed up if you're doing lower body stuff really make sure that that's moving correctly the hips and knees will follow um upper body stuff really get the shoulder blades and the neck like making sure you're going there and the elbows will follow after that um so five to seven minutes of a general warm-up a lot of times like classic exercise science it will even just put you on a bike cycling for five minutes I don't like that personally Dynamic movement is more preferred if you really just move for five to seven minutes you'll be fine there now specificity within each movement it's very important that your first exercise of the day is generally the thing you've prioritize that's oftentimes the most important you're going to do it often times is also the most complex and the most moving parts so it tends to be multi-joint it tends therefore you need to have movement precision and skill diode right you don't typically start your workouts off with the forearm curl all right like this you don't need a tremendous amount of warm-up to get going on that you're going to start off with medicine ball throws or a snatch or some agility work you you need to have the whole system going because multiple joints are moving position matters technique there's just a lot of skill requirement Etc so the individualized workout um or the specific workout for the specific movement for that very first one my general rule of thumb is like whatever it takes to move perfect in that first exercise past that you don't necessarily need to do individualized warm-ups for your next movements unless it is a movement you're trying to learn or just even get a little bit better at like drop the load a little bit work on some accruing some practice reps fantastic or it's another dissimilar complex movement so let's say your first exercise was a front squat and you got loaded for that and now you're going to move into a pull-up but your mechanics aren't the best there and so you really need to change and do some maybe more specific activation warm-ups for that or something else or it's running or something totally different so yeah you don't need to re-warm up for every single exercise as you go generally once you're good to go the same muscles that you're going to use in the next exercise are warm same joints then you're good to go you talked about intent "

            "text": "within the movement what about specific cadences for repetitions yeah I was taught that one should lower the weight slowly the so-called eccentric portion of the movement and then to try and explode the weight through the concentric phase and then also make sure that one is using full range of motion and perfect form yeah as it were now of course that is one tiny slice of the possible rep cadences and ways to approach resistance training although I think it's a pretty good one yeah what are the general parameter sets that one needs to consider you could imagine lifting you know four seconds concentric pause for one pause for two eccentric I realize there's an infinite number of variations here yeah but is there a way to use rep Cadence repetition Cadence that is as a way to work through weak points um and to be strong in every position of the movement yeah a lovely question I think the the way I would like to answer this is maybe going back just a touch to get directly to that so I think if we walk through Power strength and hypertrophy and I hit you with the concepts that are specific to each one that's going to lay out your answer because the most true answer there is it depends on the goal the answer for what is optimal for strength is diametrically opposed for potentially what's optimized hypertrophy the same exact thing can be said for momentum so we've classically heard things like this you know don't bounce at the bottom you're cheating right so if you're doing a lap pull down or something you know you don't you don't bounce and rebound you don't you stop at the bottom slow down all these things are thought to be truisms of strength conditioning but guess what those are all truisms assuming or trying to grow muscle and that's that actually goes back to our conversation and and episode one about a lot of the things we think are just fundamental truths about strength training are just fundamental truths that came from the bodybuilding world and they're not wrong they're good ideas but they're all their adaptations one needs to get from strength training that are not just maximizing muscle growth so what I will lay out to you is a case for which you should bounce a case for when you should go fast a case for when you should be under control all these things are are different variables we can modify and get different adaptations for it is there a way that you could lay out for us optimal repetition cadences for strength specifically versus hypertrophy specifically just to sort of bookend the conversation and then migrate toward the middle in terms of rep cadences that would satisfy the desire to have a bit of both we can get pretty close yeah so when you're talking about strength versus hypertrophy remember strength is a movement hypertrophy is muscle size that's that's the the key to your answer here so when you're trying to get stronger what you're effectively trying to do is get better at producing a certain amount of Force 3 movement okay now Force is mass times acceleration so what's the mass in the bar multiplied by how well I can accelerate it intentionally going slower is only reducing acceleration right so it's hard to argue that going slower is going to improve strength because you're simply reducing acceleration so you need to practice lifting heavier at a faster rate now does that mean if you're trying to get stronger there are no phases of your training in which you'll slow down or plus no of course not there are certain rules in different organizations where you have to pause the bottom like there's all kinds of little things like there but in general we want to think about what are we trying to do here we're trying to get better at moving a heavier Mass at a faster rate of acceleration that is more force that is more strength hypertrophy is not that the goal here is not a functional outcome it is what is needed to cause the most amount of hypertrophy and when you get to ipertory then your optimal Cadence is up to you you can do any combination in fact you could do it the same exact Cadence that you did your strength training with and get the same adaptations as a poetry if you modify the other variables appropriately or you could go slower or you could do pauses or you could do a thing that is called triphasic training where you spend the first phase several weeks of your training where you do eccentrics only so you're just lowering the bar and you're basically stopping you can then do the next phase of your training which is isometrics you're just holding at that bottom position and then the next phase you're training you're focusing on the concentric portion of it right triphasic one two three eccentric isometric concentric so that's a fantastic way of developing actually strength a little bit of hypertrophy but you're manipulating the variables in terms of how you execute the repetition range you can actually induce a lot of hypertrophy moving the weight fast as you mentioned even down slow under control now one thing one will never Advocate is moving any sort of weight or load uncontrolled the Assumption here when I'm saying go fast is you're always in control I never want you bouncing and crushing your sternum with the barbell Off Your Dust but you you can move at a lot of rates you can um the isometric I mentioned because this is when things like body weight training come into play absolutely you can gain strength and even a little bit of hypertrophy especially in the upper body doing isometrics is much harder to do this but the lower body um you just you just you outrun that coverage really quickly you need load but there's a lot of ways this is also probably why people have done things like gone to yoga only or Pilates or some of these things that are body weight based and there's no external load and they've actually increased muscle size so I'm getting the picture there are a ton of options in terms of rep cadences however can we say that one should pick a given rep Cadence within an exercise rather than changing it from set to set within an exercise or that one should perhaps even pick a certain rep Cadence for an entire workout I'm suspecting that your answer is going to be it depends yeah it is but if you know I'm not going to use the if you had a gun to your head kind of situation but if you had a gun to your head what would be the rep Cadence that you would prescribe yeah for strictly strength or as much strength with as little hypertrophy as possible and in picking that rep Cadence then it therefore has to thread throughout the entire exercise bout so you're actually right you can because of that undulating periodization stuff I talked about you can actually do this in a lot of ways so you could do one exercise at the beginning where you have a set Cadence say a three one one it is like a very one so that's con so that's Lifting for three pause for one lower for one uh be generally the opposite okay so the first number is always The Eccentric generally okay so depending on exercise lowering the the weight for a count of three yeah pause for one yeah it totally depends on the exercise like a deadlift starts concentric and finishes eccentric but a bench press starts yeah okay so it's start to finish start to finish is the better way to think about it yeah so in I'll clarify actually when we say 3-1-1 we're generally talking about almost always The Eccentric is the slower portion regardless if it's the first or the last right so whether you're doing a bench press or The Eccentric is lowering the bar to your chest that's the first part of the movement one two three pause one one up which means accelerate as hard as you can the way up that's what you describe right as opposed to say a row a row which is actually going to be starting off concentric so you're going to be pulling that thing to your chest as fast as you can under control not slamming off your chest holding for one second and then taking three seconds to lower it back on the rack or on the ground or whatever so the reason we do that is somewhat intuitive but it is again to make sure you're not advancing a bar or an Implement onto your physical body at an extremely fast rate that that's very difficult to deal with so a three one one is a very standard um strength protocol that is something you can just run with if that's all you ever wanted to do it'd be absolutely fine lower the bar for a count of three it actually ends up being approximately three hardly anybody is counting off seconds precisely I mean it's I suppose it's doable but then pausing briefly yep and that brief is almost uh that pause is almost um unmeasurable it is simply are you under control before you transition from the center to concentricular concentration it's just a safety thing so once you feel down you've reached complete range of motion you're ready to transition then just go you don't really need to go like 1000 Watts and then go up it's just making sure again we don't slam weights off of body parts and that final one in the three one one the execution of the usually concentric portion of of the exercise yep as fast as you possibly can okay so that would be for the majority of the outcome being strength yep okay and of course we should acknowledge again there are a ton of variations that one could Implement there but that that would be a good starting place on the opposite side for somebody who's mainly interested in hypertrophy yeah what would be the rep Cadence that um if you had a gun to your head that you would prescribe I would probably do the exact same thing but I would like I would make the last number two so three one two you could also just keep three one on it is still very fine even exploding on the contrast is still highly effective for training hypertrophy so if you want to keep it super simple and just make rep Cadence not a variable that you play with because you have other ones to move that's great if you want to add a little bit of time to the concentric phase fine it's not going to do it's not going to make enough of a difference for most people for you to really worry about I guess that's sort of the point I really want to make this is we're classically this is a classic example of we're deep into a method right if as long as you get the concepts I talked about earlier whether you want to do three one one three two three three three three try phase this is just a method choice that doesn't mean they're irrelevant they are there are subtle changes within them it's just 80 20 rule right so 80 of the benefit is going to be from the concept 20 is this small thing if you're super into this field or you actually want to work with a qualified uh certified coach or something they there's lots of reasons to play with this if you're just on your own here and running this thing 311 is fine 312 totally fine anything like that you really just want to make sure that in the strength side of the equation you're under control and you can add enough load to stimulate strength and not get hurt with an acute trauma right on the hypertrophy side you're just wanting to load enough to where you can hit volume because you got to put a lot on there so if you want to go lighter if you want to go slower fine you if you go slower in your repetition so maybe even like a five SEC second eccentric a two second pause a three second Rise that's great you can actually then stimulate the same amount of hypertrophy and either do it with less weight or do it with less repetitions so it's a variable you can play with if you're like hey I don't have enough weights at my house or I only have a kettlebell or a dumbbell how am I going to stimulate hypertrophy your only option is really doing more reps well eventually that that train runs pretty shallow okay here's the thing you can play with maybe just add time under tension that's what we're calling right just you know do slower repetitions go longer ones and hold it so it's a variable that we use to individualize programs rather than something that you should really be focused on as like a core aspect that's going to be driving whether or not your program works it's just a tool we can play with in the what-if scenarios um I will use this stuff a lot when I'm traveling you can do a tremendous workout in your hotel room just doing like a 10 second eccentric a 10 second hold a 10 Centric concentric yeah I've had some decent hotel room workouts they're not my preference but um by simply doing things like um 10 second lowering uh handstand push up against the door totally um obviously assisted for me I don't I can't do a free handstand push-up yeah um I just don't have the skill or the strength or both um you can do some sort of configured dips between the beds or chairs and this kind of thing um squats are great to do in hotels put your back foot up on a on a bed and get a an amazing split squat workout done yeah a lot glute Bridges lots of stuff you can do that yeah with a jump rope if you've ever heard someone jumping in the in the morning yeah um it may or may not have been me it could be any number of things but I am known to skip rope in uh in hotel rooms um not to get overly detailed but I "

            "text": "think there are going to be a number of people wondering about how to breathe during repetitions and how to breathe in between sets so I'd like to just briefly touch on this and this is something that I know we're going to return to again when we have our discussion about recovery but is there a general rule of thumb for how to breathe during repetitions during work yep for strength maybe even strength versus hypertrophy in in a way that maximizes oxygen input to the system you know keeps you uh alert and conscious but that also protects the body by creating some rigidity in the system right because certainly being def with all your exhale the body is a very different beast in terms of stability than with the body full of air versus you know breathing during the repetition movement there's a maneuver that is long been uh labeled the valsalva techniques so what that really means is you're trying to use air to create intra-abdominal pressure and what you're really trying to do is create a cylinder around your spine the real issue you have to to play here is regulation of blood pressure and spinal stability now you should be able to breathe and Brace what I mean by that is you should be able to create total intra-abdominal pressure regulate uh spine control while breathing it's just very hard for a lot of people to do it's a skill you should absolutely work on you can actually you can do this and you can go around like I do this trick in class and students can come and they can push any part um of my entire abdomen it's super tight and I can talk now it's going to be a little bit labored you can hear a little bit of a difference but you should be able to do that if you have to like hunch down and you can't even muster your breath and it takes that to create pressure you're not actually you don't really understand the abdominal control necessary to create that stability so step number one is that's the goal now with the blood pressure thing we have to be careful because a standard blood pressure ideally if we sat around right now it was probably something like 120 over 80. systolic versus diastolic that's a normal number right high blood pressure is something over that well with an acute bout of exercise you can see that number reach as high as like 450 over 350. which effectively means you have total blood occlusion right your blood pressure is so high blood is not moving anywhere and it's in the middle of a very heavy set especially complex movements especially when they're loaded on your body this could be an overhead press or squat variations anything like that blood pressure is going to be a problem and the reason why that matters is that's what's going to make you pass out it's not the fact that you ran out of oxygen in three seconds it's the fact that blood pressure got so high you blocked out and so we want to have we're gonna have to play this game of releasing a little bit of the pressure so we can actually get blood to move a little bit making sure that we don't lose spinal stability so we can finish our workout that's really the question you asked right how do I play this game of oh I have several hundred pounds on my back or my chest and I don't want to Exhale right so I don't lose spinal stability but at the same time I don't want to pass out right which is which is a problem so a kind of a couple of rules of thumb if you're going to be doing something in which you can complete the entire exercise without a breath and it is of a maximal or close to load that's probably your best strategy so in that particular case you'll see a lot of breathing techniques where you're going to take a very large inhale ideally this is done through the abdomen not the shoulders so we shouldn't seeing clavicles Rising during this thing you'll see a common mistake of of the bars on their back and you see people do this like big inhale thing and all they do is Elevate their collabos that's not necessarily going to increase pressure through the abdomens which is what you're looking for so you want to be thinking about belly moving out in all four areas in front of you to your left and right and to your back that's that quadrant sort of idea of stabilizing your spine you can do that independent of your clavicles moving like your shoulders don't need to rise for that you don't really need the oxygen for metabolic purposes you're just using the air for a brace that's really all you're after so you're trying to visualize your torso is more or less a cylinder yep and you're trying to fill it with air the logic being that if I were to push down onto a say a full unopened can of soda yep water for all your sugar phobes out there soda water uh and then push as hard as I could it's going to be hard for me to crush that can but if the can were empty or if it were a little bit kinked in the middle correct then I could likely Crush that can yeah what you're really doing is you have your spinal Erectors in the back right and then a whole series of abdominal exercises and you actually have some neural control systematic control of Contracting those but the you don't have muscles on the inside that you can do so you're basically bringing in air and saying I'll use air to push from the inside out and I'll use muscles to push from the outside in to create this brace and I don't want over compression with the muscles this is a like if you if you see people that have just enormous spinal Erectors sometimes that's an indicator of actually a poor breathing or bracing strategy because they're using spinal rectors to create all their compression and not actually using the inside enough that's not always the case but sort of like a thing to think about so over compression through the spinal rectus is not necessarily ideal if you wanted the best scenario is a little bit of a brace of both so we use some air to push this side we use some musculature depressed that way and then that that spine is just nicely held in position again not in a position where I've locked down my diaphragm and I can't get any air out I should be able to get that brace pattern and then be able to speak in fact like I'm doing it right now and you'll see like a little bit of if you're really paying attention to my voice you can hear a little bit of a subtle difference but I should be able to do this for quite a long time right like I I could take a maximum rep right here in this position whether I'm overhead pressing doing some sort of row like anything and feel very braced in in the entire quadrant this is very helpful I I'm going to work on it but can we say that a an effective way to start off in terms of breathing during repetitions would be to take a gulp of air during the lowering phase The Eccentric phase and then to Exhale during the yeah concentric exertion phase I asked that because that's what I've been doing for a while and it makes me feel safe I don't know if I am and it allows me to Exhale as I exert the the hardest portion of the exercise yeah and perhaps I also borrowed that from martial arts where one tends most often is trained to Exhale on the on the strike yeah if you're going to be doing again the number of repetitions can be completed without a breath a lot of times you're better off saving that exhalation until you complete wow but you don't have to but for a reasonably heavy set of hack squats or even leg extensions and given that I already can't leg extension my body weight maybe it's established oh maybe this is why um the idea of holding my breath for an entire compound set so again I'm kind of listening to mine um you know like where is my insurance card who's going to drive me to the hospital this kind of thing um in all seriousness what if I want to breathe during the set yeah so I I'll clarify I'm generally meaning if you're doing like a one rep max or something like that okay well they certainly could hold my breath for a one repetition maximum that you know maybe like a double or something like that depending on what you're doing like maybe a triple a bench press you can probably do three and get away with it a squat it gets harder deadlift so it kind of depends on the exercise um you want to take that breath though prior to The Eccentric portion not during so lower breathe in lock or set and now start our movement pattern wherever it's going to be exhaling on the concentrate portion during it is fine it's no problem um especially if you're not extremely heavy and what's your what are your thoughts on grunting and screaming yeah fine I don't care I don't tend to do that I'm occasionally known to squeal or whimper I think of you and I think squeal whimper absolutely thanks um if you're going to be doing multiple repetitions uh what we actually do for the NFL combine is we teach them a very specific Excel strategy so there's one test that they do uh which is they bench press 225 pounds for as many reps as possible a lot of these people will get 25 to 40 repetitions so we have a very specific breathing pattern it would be something like if we think that they're going to do around 25 reps say that's like our goal we might say okay do the first 10 without a breath and then exhale reset and then do five breath and then you might do five breath three breath two breath and then one breath per rep until we can't get any more um so we'll have very specific strategies for them um so what I would say is think about how many you're going to complete and and then breathe according to that and it tends to increase in frequency as the number gets closer to failure because you're going to want that that error a little bit but you just want to make sure that when you re when you're breathing back in you're in a safe spot so you don't want to be catching that like re-breath when the weight's on you you want to be in a locked out position or away from you when you're standing so it tends to be like at the end of the exercise not in the middle of it which is is going to be a recipe for problems if you take your breath then one of the reasons I'm so happy to have "

            "text": "you here and having this discussion is we can really get into the weeds but also hit a number of questions that I hear a lot how does one contend with the first attempt at a lift not working out is it too heavy something goes wrong hopefully not injury promoting wrong but something goes wrong do you count that do you reset the workout and then the counterpart to that question is what do you do if it's too easy it went wrong because you didn't put enough weight on the bar do you pick up a heavy enough set of dumbbells do you abandon the set and and replace it with another and I guess this is really a question of how much margin for error is there in volume yep when doing this three by five program sure uh two things that I'd like to start with number one is I talked about linear periodization and unrelated periodization there's actually a new model newish model called Auto regulation which basically says you're going to go in today and depending on any number of biomarkers performance markers or your performance you will adjust your training based on how you're feeling that day and so 70 is not maybe for example not necessarily 70 of your one repetition Max highest ever is 70 of what you can actually do that day and so it actually allows you to Auto regulate your training based on actually what's happening and so you don't have to have as much long-term planning in your program design um because it'll sort of figure itself out as you're going you can use velocity to determine the sort of Regulation you can use actually it's like taking it up to close to a Max for the day and then basing all your percentages on that daily Max or a lot of different ways so that is actually one of very effective strategy and there's a lot of research coming out on auto regulation there's a lot of different ways to do it so that's one thing to say another thing to say is this three to five okay it depends on if we're going for speed power or strength because while all those other variables are the same for three to five the core difference between whether that is a power workout or a strength workout is the load right so if you are at a moderate load say thirty percent of your one repetition Max up to about 70 percent that's going to be a power based adaptation assuming you're going with high intent can you sorry I I have to interrupt maybe just clarify what intent is yeah you're attempting to move the implement or go through the movement pattern as fast as you can great thank you if you're trying to go for strength and you're below 70 percent you're not really going to be improving strength because the total mass is not heavy enough and so really when we say strength we're assuming you're at at least generally 70 percent or higher now if you're new to training totally different thing right but if you're moderately trained to highly trained you're going to be whale north of 70 so anything below that we don't really count anyways um that's those are warm-up sets basically all right so one thing to actually give you some very specific numbers here and I don't have all of these memorized who can perhaps um provide a chart later or send out something to them but there's a chart that you can look up called a prilippin chart how do you spell that uh p r i l i p i n and there's actually been a a few studies on it it's it's a it's been old it's been around for a very long time it's sort of in the coaching realm and then a handful of studies out of New Zealand came out verifying and validating a lot of it but what it effectively does is if strength is the goal and this comes from the power lifting weightlifting sort of communities or optimizing for strength then how much time do I need to spend at each intensity range so 70 80 90 Etc because specificity is going to say this if you want to get better neuromuscular guy at shooting a basketball the most important thing you could ever do is shoot a basketball under the exact circumstances that you're going to do it right specificity always wins if you want to get better at strength the most important thing you need to do is that exact movement at that load and in this case if you wanted to get better at your bench press lifting at 100 of your max on a bench press is the most specific thing you could ever do the more you can do that the faster you will increase your bench press Max however that's very hard to do without getting hurt it's also not addressing what I call your Defender so if the reason you can't bench press higher than whatever you're benching now it may not be your pure strength it may be any number of things like you don't have enough muscle or technique or these things okay great so specificity over here um variation on the other side so we're playing this game we've talked about of how do I make sure that I can have enough specificity in my training without leading to uh overuse injury all how do I maximize or how do I reduce my chance of injury while getting enough specificity and so we have a classic Paradigm however here one actually training protocol you can look up is called a Bulgarian method and the bulgarians were an amazing at the sport of Olympic weightlifting probably in fact the um the the patriarch of this entire thing recently passed away Ivan IBA jayev uh niams glue pocket Hercules one of the greatest weightlifters of all time came out of the system and they do a lot of things but one example in the Bulgarian system is you're going to do a one repetition maximum snatch you're gonna take a little bit of a break you'll do a one repetition maximum cleaner jerk take a little bit of a break do a one repetition maximum front squat take a little bit of a break and you're gonna repeat that two to three times a day every day that's specificity right those people get extraordinarily strong now they don't do that all year round they don't do that with all their lifters but this is when we're trying to Peak for a major competition like the Olympics we are going so far into specificity and that was very counter to the Russian system at the time which is much more of our classic periodization sort of approach okay specificity is tremendous but in doing that the bulgarians just brutalized a lot of athletes right because it's very difficult to handle something like that and you can't really do that that long without getting wrecked and they're the goal is to win medals the goal is it's a totally different thing than longevity out of here right like we're trying to push the boundaries of or aesthetic changes unless someone has a naturally balanced Physique in general if people do one sort of movement I find that they tend to resemble the equipment that they did that movement with over time right that was a joke against kettlebells of course of course of course I got it so we know specificity is technically optimal but it's not realistic not for that kind of a you know extreme situation so how do we balance these things well it turns out this prilippin chart gives you guidelines for how much time and by time I mean how many repetitions to stand um in each of these rep ranges so that you get kind of the best of this world you're going to find the same thing by the way when we get into endurance training there's only so much training you can do at 95 of your heart rate before it starts becoming like quite detrimental you need to actually spend a lot of time at those lower intensities so the Philippine chart walks you through how many sets and it gives you a range like like the I think that the bottom of it is like um how much time do you spend at like 60 to 70 every one or at Max and it says like you know minimum of this set to maximum of this set but the ideal number of reps per set per week is like 18. and then I'll walk you through and so there's there's four criteria on it um I think it's 55 to 65 again how many reps there's it's like three to six reps per set um 18 to 30 reps total and I think the ideal rep range is like 24. something like that so it takes you 55 to 65 70 to 80 80 to 90 and the 90 plus percent what you'll see is the 90 plus percent number is more like one to two reps per set for a total of about seven total repetitions if you start cruising past that um other bad things start to creep up in there so that's a really effective chart what it really highlights though is even somebody who's trying to maximize strength you're going to spend something like 30 five or so percent of your training time between this like 55 to 65 range so you're asking her like well do I even count that one the answer is yeah you know in that range if it's below 55 60 percent you probably don't count it now again some coaches don't count unless it's even above 70. fine it's not a major distinction but you're going to spend the bulk of your time you know accumulating some some technique basically and skill and tissue tolerance very important The Next Step Up is like 28 I think is is sort of the cutoff of how much time you spend between 70 and 80 percent of your 100 Max and then it jumps down to like 23 and then all the way to 70 so you can walk yourself through that and that gives you an extremely good guideline and you'll notice all of these are still in three to five range it's just really you're manipulating it by total sets or total exercises so that can give you some instruction to play with we will provide a link to the prilippin Chart yeah in the show note captions training to failure when the goal is "

            "text": "Strife yeah should one do it should one avoid it or does it depend well yeah it always depends um the way that I'll generally say it is because of what we just outlined it in the brilliant chart you don't have to go to failure to see strength gains especially early or even moderate and I'm talking maybe five plus years in your lifting career would you um call beginner zero to five years of training intermediate five to twenty years of training yeah something like that and then Advance would be people that really put the time and energy into fine-tuning their program the vast majority of people who think they're Advanced are really what we would call intermediate in all domains of life Fair even as a scientist um it's quite rare to reach that number of advance so um I actually don't have any problem going to failure quite often I'm also fine with people who don't want to go all the way there you can get most of what you need getting what we call technical failure so this is like okay that was really challenging uh boy you started to have some breakdowns of technique we're gonna call that good The Only Exception here I want to point out is people who are either novice or beginners they really have no concept of what 100 means and so I think it's actually very fruitful to take them to 100 just to give them a guideline of where it's at now of course do this on exercises that they are comfortable with or close and then you maybe maybe this is on a machine maybe this is single joint movements or whatever it takes for them to have confidence but I actually I don't think you should be scared of these they're not really um that much more dangerous than anything else there's I mean think about it if you're going to do a front squat or any exercise and your one rep max is 200 pounds is it really that much more dangerous to do one try at 205 pounds than it is to do five tries at 190 pounds is it really that much more no like it's not so you can do like we talked about in the the first episode you can do a repetition Max estimate where you get to like 85 to 95 of where you think you are and then instead of adding load you just do as many reps as you can Google that number and it'll tell you the conversion estimate of what your own right Max is that's fine but also I have absolutely no issue in fact I generally encourage it to take people up to that level um certainly not day one or anywhere close to that but at some point let's see what you actually got I'm just I'm just going to cut it off early what I'm going to consider to be 100 Max anything more than a minor technical breakdown is is for that crew we're going to stop and call that good and ideally with a spotter especially um you know bench pressing don't bench press alone in your basement kind of thing a few people die each year from bench pressing alone in their basement yep or use dumbbells if you're going to do that yeah it's hard harder to die using dumbbells I suppose you could um drop them on your head or something but not get stuck under them um exercise selection and frequency of exercise implementation across the week so I can imagine with this three by five routine done three to five times per week you can imagine changing up the exercises every workout although considering that most of these three by five routines are going to be done with compound movements generally the sooner or later one runs out of movements if the goal is to hit major all the major muscle groups yeah however let me give an example and ask if it's okay to for instance do the three by five routine where one of the exercises for back is say a bent over row uh you do that Monday Wednesday and Friday okay you know I can imagine one could do that and still recover and improve over time but five days a week bend over rows five days a week is that okay I mean can one still progress um and there I could imagine it's a strong answer of Depends because some people recover more slowly and others I'm very comfortable doing hitting muscle groups once directly per week and once indirectly that's worked for me far better than two or three times per week you know I get you know looks of sympathy when when I say this but it's actually it's just how my physiology Works um kind of yeah well and maybe I'm not optimizing a number of different features but the point being that some people really do seem to be able to train a muscle every day and still make progress other people seem to have trouble when they train a muscle every day so how does one establish exercise selection when the goal is to make progress um and this brings up something very important and we're going to have a whole episode about this but local versus systemic recovery yep that you know is the whole nervous system becoming fatigued and is the muscle group and the related musculoskeletal systems becoming fatigued we're going to go back to thinking about when you make these comments about it takes you three to five days and you've got better results in there the assumption that you're probably running under is your training Style is more reflecting that recovery time than it is your physiology it's not you it's how you're training so if you look at again all the Olympic weight lifters that are competing they're going to be squatting or some variation of squatting every day that that's going to happen like a lot of the times they're training multiple times a day and they will be doing some basically barbell full squat multiple times a day every day six days a week you know something like that they're the best in the world at getting powerful they're tremendously good at getting strong you can do it right it comes down to what does your volume look like what type of movements are you doing what rep range what overall volume are you hitting and how are you doing it if you look at athletes they train their legs every day when they're running around they're doing Speed and Agility training every single day they don't need you know three days to recover can you imagine a basketball player trying to ask for like three days to recover between practice right well to be fair as you as you chuckle at me I'm doing other things on the intervening days yeah so I'll train a muscle group like legs and then I'll give it four days before I do an indirect yeah um uh what I call an indirect exercise for legs which for me would be sprinting yep then I get two days and then I'm training them again but nonetheless an athlete has to do that every day right right so the absolute the answer is you absolutely can train any of these muscles every single day it really comes down to volume right and it comes down to movement type um and how are you getting it so with in the case of of weightlifters and athletes what we tend to see happen is there's not a there's two things there is a long period of conditioning and I don't mean endurance what I mean is is tissue tolerance and conditioning so they're not going to start off their career at that pace right their career might start off at five days a week but maybe every other of those days is a PVC pipe only and you're just training the movement patterns you're working on technique Etc and then eventually maybe after six months or a year those PVC pipe days turn into barbell only days so now you went from you know a pound to 45 pounds and eventually as your years go on that that wrapses up so it depends on the style in general speed and power stuff is so light it almost requires because it's non-fatiguing it requires almost no amount of no recovery so if you were truly doing say like um you know when you say it's funny because when you say I do legs on Mondays you don't even realize it but an athlete does legs every day right but you're saying legs and what you're really saying is I do hypertrophy legs Mondays pretty much that I don't want to get into what I do specifically because it's less important than what other people choose to implement but the repetition ranges anywhere from 4 to 12. correct so you're covering up pretty yeah you're smack dead in the peak soreness longest recovery rate volume is relatively low intensity is very very high workouts are very very true so if you were to switch that and you were to stay under four repetitions higher quality uh higher rest in between them I would be willing to bet a large amount of money that you'd be fine the next day certainly 48 hours and if you were to actually go way lower and keep you know three to five and keep it very very light and train for Speed you would have absolutely no issue the next day so it really comes down to a function of training you're right in that hypertrophy Zone which is something that you probably need 48 hours at minimum to recover from because what you won't see are bodybuilders training the same muscle group on multiple days like very often at most it will be indirect but generally they're not going to do that every single day for the same reason so you're training in that style that's what it's going to take to recover if you trained in a different style then it wouldn't take that long to recover so for the person starting out would you recommend they pick three to five exercises and stick with those so that they can get their skill and movement and positioning and breathing all that really dialed in and then start to experiment by varying one or two of those exercises over time that's great if you look at the the conjugate model so these are the the strongest power lifters as a collective group that ever existed what they're very good at is they keep almost the exact same weekly structure but they make a very small change in exercise variation so for example say Wednesday is bench day right they're going to always binge on Wednesdays but maybe this week they're going to do close grip bench and then maybe next week it's going to be maybe a a special type of barbell and then maybe the week after that it's um you know maybe they'll change the range of motion a little bit so it's actually the exact same exercise where they're making a very small variation and that change alone allows them to do enough specificity but also gives them enough variation where it's not the exact same stimuli in the exact same spot over and over and over and that's what allows that group plus lots of other assistance but it's what allows that group to train very very very heavy very consistently and not have to worry about too much planning for periodization and other stuff like that they get their back off by making small variations in exercise I will say a major mistake folks do make is they change their exercises entirely way too often if I were to have to pick one or the other I would say don't change anything on your exercises for six weeks probably realistic maybe even 10 to 12 weeks and then you can make some changes you should not be changing every single week the general pump you're just you're not going to see progress it's going to be very difficult to do that so it's going to take you three weeks generally to figure out the groove of the exercise to figure out how well you can load it what's too much to where you woke up unbelievably sore that was a train wreck how much do I load it at what position how long is this going to take it's going to take you three or so weeks and then you can really start pushing there so changing it before that or in that time frame is is you're not going to be able to progressively overload because you're just not going to know exactly where you're at on all the exercises so it's very important to create standardization within them and then see some progress in a movement or a muscle Group whatever you're going for and then make some changes so before we dive into our discussion "

            "text": "about hypertrophy can we just get a brief recap of the general parameters for an excellent power and strength training program okay let me hit you with these rapid fire and you can maybe come ask questions along that remember those modifiable variables okay so let's go through them in order and then what they mean specifically for power versus strength so modifiable variable number one is called choice so which exercises do I select for strength in general for power or speed or strength we want to select compound movements you don't often see people doing maximum strength work for like a tricep Kickback right it's typically multiple joint movements and typically complex um movements in selecting these compound movements we generally want to actually think about exercise selection of movements rather than muscle groups so this is an important distinction because we'll see this is a different answer when we get hypertrophy what I mean by that is when we think about again strength training we tend to think about bodybuilding Concepts we go to the gym and we do things like I got to make sure I get my chest today and I got to make sure I get my hamstrings and now you're selecting exercises based on a muscle you want to work for strength development and power we want to think about movements rather than individual muscle groups so there should be like things like I need to train explosive hip extension which is like a a vertical jump or something like that I I want to train pushing or pulling movements or I want to attain road trip I want to train rotation which is a whole area we haven't gotten into which is very important for overall health and wellness and Longevity so we want to select big movements by the muscle the movement patterns that we want to introduce and we just want to select a reasonable balance between these I don't care what the exact ratio is you just don't want to go an entire six months without doing anything in this rotational area or an entire you know eight to ten weeks without doing something without the lower body hinge right so any number of examples there so just think about the rough movement patterns upper and lower push and pull and then some sort of rotation that puts you in a pretty good spot if you're using three by five method and you're going to pick as little as three exercises just pick one from each one of those group pick a rotation pick a push and pick a pull I can easily think of a pushing a pull so for example bench press or shoulder press sure row or chin for pull and then squat or deadlift for hinge yep what would be a good example of a quality rotational movement yep so anytime um you can use a cable machine like at the gym and you can do it's kind of hard to describe this exercise but basically you're going to stand facing the cable and you're going to pull it towards yourself and then rotate like you're pivoting like your either swing angle golf club or hitting a baseball bat so you're facing One Direction I'm facing you right now I'm pulling the cable towards myself and then I'm going to spin do a 180 degree pivot and face exactly away from you when I finish and then return it back to that same spot so that's a rotation great we will provide a link to an example of that that you consider a quality example a medicine ball throw any number of things like this are a great rotational exercise all right so we select our exercises based on that we generally then okay because that is the case we don't worry about things like eccentric versus concentric because you're deadly doing a whole body athletic movement right which The Eccentric concentric portion is going to be folded into that you really can't separate them out all right so that's exercise Choice our first variable the next one is exercise order so because that everything driving power and strength is quality based you want to do these at the beginning of your workout you would not want to do anything fatiguing before this so no cardiovascular training no other repetition to failure stuff if you do those before and now you're slower all you've done is practice getting slower and and so these need to be done when you're fresh you also need to do them when you're very fresh because they are the most neurologically demanding they're complicated they tend to have multiple steps and they're often in multiple planes and coordination is a difficult thing and if you're trying to do all that at maximum speed your nervous system needs to be tremendously fresh and so any amount of fatigue here is only going to compromise the results um to kind of recap that one of the major mistakes when training for strength and especially power is people worry way too much about fatigue those things should not be part of the equation in fact if they are that's a very good sign you're not doing this correctly right these are non-fatiguing movements especially speed and Power so Choice order is next the next one after that is volume and we sort of hit volume and intensity which is the other one we talked about that the volume is basically identical between power and strength the the general number we're going to look at here is something like 3 to 20 sets total per workout per workout um but that would be like 20 would be a little bit of a special case now three to five is what I told you earlier right I'm just saying like sometimes you can actually go quite higher in this cases but that's the general range and once somebody finishes the three by five workout for power or strength if they decide they want to throw in some calf raises and curls and totally a forearm work or a little bit of jogging on the treadmill or something that's okay absolutely there is you have very little risk of interference for things like speed and Power strength you have a little bit of a risk only because now you're introducing fatigue which if you're really pushing strength that might compromise your recovery I could imagine doing the three to five routine for strength or for power and then somebody finishing up with um 10 or 15 minutes of hypertrophy arm work and then being very seriously compromised if they try and come in the next day or even the next day correct and do those big compound movements for Speed and power that's right not just because they're sore but the muscles may actually still be damaged and I know later we're going to talk about the um somewhat tenuous relationship between soreness and Recovery yeah yep so that that's a that's a really nice uh heuristic to pay attention to is you can but just be careful Energy starts to matter at that point if you're really truly trying to maximize strength you would do nothing at all outside of that training if you're just like I kind of want to get stronger and some other things and you're willing to lose strength you know five percent of your strength gains then you're totally fine um the same can be said by the way for super setting so supersetting is an idea that says like wait a minute you're telling me dude I gotta take five minutes in between each set well that's not so much a problem nowadays with phone with um smartphones because people are filling their intercept intervals with social media and texting correct you you don't really have to go that long in fact there was actually a study that came out in the last month that showed you know like really two minutes is probably sufficient for most people having said that if you really are trying to push maximal strength adaptations like three to five is very very reasonable um your those training sessions are long because you have to take you're spending more time not doing anything then you are doing something but you're trying to maximize quality so that's just sort of like part and parcel if you're not super worried about it you can actually do super setting which is let's imagine again you're going to do some some lunges and while your legs are resting doing their three to five minutes you can go over and do an upper body row or pull and when your upper body is resting you're going back the legs so that really Cuts your time in half is it ideal no we actually ran a study uh maybe 10 years ago in our lab and we looked at that specifically and we did see a reduction in strength performance in the supersetting group relative to the group who did not superset the question then it becomes like is it enough for you to care so if you were to if I were to say hey I can cut an hour off of your workout time but you will lose five percent of your strength gain almost everyone would take that exchange with the exception of people who are getting close to competition or really trying to set a new lifetime PR or something then you might say no I don't want any interference there that last little margin is what I care about give me the extra rest great so it's not a does it work does it not work it's always a what are you willing to give up uh versus get the practicalities of supersetting are staggering push-pull push pull in my mind are real because you have to take over large segments of the gym which oftentimes leads to a situation where your rest times are too long or highly variable because people are working in or you can't finish your set because now someone jumped into the machine right it totally screws right you lose three to five of your friends because it's obnoxious when you're taking over all the equipment but in all seriousness I think um it's wonderful if you have the space and the format to do it but at least in my experience end observation these people know who they are it's not practical to do on a regular basis if you train in an open commercial gym yeah tough to pull up so um we've covered choice order volume and intensity to a sufficient level the last one is frequency and we've already sort of indirectly talked about that where frequency can be as high as you'd like in this area it really depends on your recovery if you're really truly pushing maximum strength you probably do need a few days to recover although that's dependent upon you but speed and power can be done multiple times a day almost every day basically the one exception would be maximum sprinting speed you need to be careful there for things like hamstring and injury especially if you're pretty fast so you want to be a little bit cautious of that but if you're doing easier movements like medicine ball throws or kettlebell swings or something you could do those quite often as long as the volume is is staying pretty low last little piece here is progression how do I progress over time so I mentioned this earlier but just want to fill this Gap right back in before we head over to hypertree which is three to five percent increase per week of intensity in general and you can do upwards of about five percent increase in volume per week over time and I generally recommend running that for at longest eight weeks but probably most realistically you want to go about five weeks or so and then have some sort of a deload or back off week if you do that you're generally going to be a pretty good spot so those are like the Core Concepts now there's a whole bunch of fun methods you can play with within all these categories and I I would like to actually cover just a couple of them um if we've got a little more space for that sure I'd love to hear about those I'd like to also just cue up one which "

            "text": "is well I joked about people texting and doing social media between sets and I that's not a joke well I confess I stopped bringing my phone into the gym because of the urge to you know take my mind off of the workout and I just started enjoying my workouts a lot more yeah and the workouts go far better that way and they're just much more efficient it for me I realize that some people their careers take place in the gym and so for the I don't um look down upon anyone using their phone at the gym but that really tends to help me but I do wonder whether or not there's an optimal Behavior or mindset in between sets I've heard before that pacing around can actually help diffuse some of the lactate and other metabolic byproducts of of work and exertion yeah that can lead to better performance I've also heard that um you know shaking the muscles out I mean there's all sorts of gym lore um about this but maybe there's also some decent science I'm just curious uh if you have any specific recommendations that people could play with or try yep so for for Speed and Power you want to walk this balance of stiff but fresh and so if you were to literally finish a repetition sit on a bench for five minutes you would stand up after that fairly stiff and you wouldn't feel sort of smooth this is all so this is an all-known science this is all practical application right data anecdata there you go strength is a little bit different but it's the same concept you're walking that line in general a lot of the times if you see Power lifters and weightlifters in between sets they're going to sit down and not move for hypertrophy can be a little bit different because you're getting towards fatigue and so the factors you mentioned like clearing lactate well first of all lactate is not actually causing fatigue that's that's a giant myth that will which is why I teed it up no I'm just kidding um but in the case of again speed power you're not going to fatigue so fatigue Management's not really an issue you want to make sure that you're getting complete neurological recovery which is a little bit slower than muscle energetically you're not out of any gas whatsoever right um You are not a lack of fuel you know doing three repetitions of a vertical jump yep no plenty of glycogen totally what about stretching between sets yeah you probably don't want to do that either there are very clear examples of pre-exercise stretching static stretching being quite detrimental for maximum power production the same thing for speed and strength and that's been shown actually a number of times in a number of Laboratories which is like a a classic Hallmark any scientist looks for of like really jumping on board with an idea if it's shown not only multiple times but in multiple Laboratories for multiple scientists and they're all seeing the same thing you start to get a lot of confidence that that's a real finding and that's been shown we've done that in our Center for sport performance not myself but one of my colleagues has done a lot of stretching research and he's seen that a lot on everything from vertical jump to ISO kinetic dynamometers and enforce velocity curves and there's we've seen this as printing we've seen this in speed we've seen this in loaded stuff so you don't want to spend a ton of time stretching statically stretching a muscle priority if you do that and you have to do that say say for example you finish that you're just like feeling really tight yeah go ahead like you need to get in the right position especially for most people where are you willing to sacrifice 10 of power to make sure you don't get hurt yes that answer is almost always yes outside of some very specific athlete scenarios so if you're not in the right position I actually remember having this conversation with Kelly uh Kelly started a long time ago it was just like yeah fine I'll lose five percent if that means I'm not going to get in a bad position and hurt my back and I totally totally agree so if you got to open up a hip or an ankle or something to get there get in the right position number one we'll live with the five percent reduction in power and if you do just reactivate so before you go do your working set go do something fast again a vertical jump a short Sprint acceleration and sort of get that system cleared back up um if you didn't stretch it for long enough and you didn't hold it for long enough you should be able to be just fine so when it comes to hypertrophy now you can really stretch all you want because we're not it's not driven by intensity or outcome it's being driven by an insult into the tissue and so if you're pre-fatigue for hypertrophy it doesn't matter if you're pre-stretched that doesn't matter we're not going for quality of outcome we're going for quality of internal signal which is not going to be changed by your Force output so it doesn't really matter you mentioned a few other things that "

            "text": "as opposed to power what are the additional variables they should consider again within the context of this overarching theme of choice order volume frequency and progression absolutely it's almost identical with a couple of small exceptions number one you probably can't do as many working sets per week for strength because now you're introducing a heavier load and that's going to represent some sort of fatigue load on the tissue all those things so you could probably get away with doing 20 sets of two of a vertical jump four or five times a week you probably couldn't do that at a 90 on squat right so the total amount of sets and the total amount of weekly load you can get to just needs to be lower and then the intensity right so we talked about that needs to be generally higher than 70 yeah with you know some portion of that being working sets at some point so that really truly being at 90 plus everything else is pretty identical you still want to emphasize maximum speed despite the fact you may actually not be moving faster because you've introduced load you still need to be attempting that but you're going to be picking complex exercises you're generally going to be hedging more towards barbells and machines so this is a case where bodyweight training can be effective again particularly for the upper body but at some point you're really going to have to move past that because there's just a certain amount of load you can't put on the lower body with just your body weight you get limited by how much you weigh or I mean there's a couple of things you can do but you're going to run out past that pretty quickly and so in when it comes to strength they tend to be less athletic movements because you know we have to have a barbell on us we have to have a we have to be on a machine or something like that and so that's a subtle difference in exercise choice we need to also be careful about The Eccentric portion and things like that we don't have as much risk in like a speeder power one so um some of the different things you can play with there we've talked about doing things like pushes and pulls I also love carries so a farmer's carry pushing a sled dragging a sled all kinds of things a yoke walk all kinds of carry modalities that are very very effective for strength um there's eccentric overload training which we really haven't gone into but it's a really Advanced technique where you can actually load at greater than 100 percent of your one repetition Max but you're only going to do The Eccentric portion of it so physiologically you are much stronger eccentrically than you are concentrically for a variety of of muscle tissue reasons actually and so imagine if you can do a bench press at 200 pounds and what you might actually do is load it to 220 and you would have a spotter and maybe even use it in a rack and you would lower it Down Under Control all the way to the bottom and then stop your friends would lift it back up the top and you just practice that eccentric portion you would actually be able to lower say 220 pounds effectively despite the fact that you wouldn't have been able to lift it back up you don't need to start there but that is a very effective method for increase in fact arguing one of my um one of my doctoral students right now is doing a project on this at USC and he uh like he's focusing directly on this and it's it's quite clear this oftentimes more effective at strength development than anything else because you can actually just like in the speed example where you want to actually practice moving faster so instead of practicing 100 of you on our Max for strength you actually practice that higher than that to get better at it so that's that's another much more advanced tool please don't let me get sued by saying all that like folks be careful make sure you're doing the proper exercise in your positioning and like caveat caveat caveat okay um but outside of that it can be it's totally fine and safe yeah with it when people get injured they can't train you can't train you don't progress you lose progress so uh certainly that's worth highlighting so two more um a little more advanced techniques that I want to throw out there and one of them is called cluster sets so cluster sets are there's a bunch of ways to do it but imagine taking a mini break in between every single repetition so say you're going to do five repetitions yeah in a row what you're actually going to do is do one repetition set it down pause for five to ten seconds and then do the next one pause do the next one pause pause pause pause pause so you can imagine doing like a squat and you're gonna go down explode up and you're standing you're going to Rack it out you're gonna kind of like shake back out catch your breath walk back in do another one rock it out and you can repeat that until you've executed your three or four or five repetitions and then you take your three to five minute break before your next step that is an incredibly effective way for both strength power and actually even hypertrophy because you can keep the quality the force output the power output very very very high because you're getting these little mini breaks and you're not getting fatigue setting in by the time you're say third or fourth or fifth repetition in that set after repetition one you start to see very small subtle reductions power up but because you start to see a little bit of fatigue you you take those five to ten seconds off even up to 20 seconds you can actually do it you don't see any drop and enforce output over the course of the five and so what you really have done is you've gotten five in this example first repetitions which is the way we will kind of say it right so all five of those have the same quality as rep number one which is again as we're talking that's the driver and strength and so that's the one we want to preserve so it takes a little bit longer for some exercises it's not very good it's great for like a deadlift because you set it back down check it back out re-grip hard to do with the bench you got to re-rack it back in then re-rack it back out that's like kind of a pain in the ass so there's some exercises that doesn't work well with and some that it does but cluster sets and a lot of research on those um very effective would you recommend if somebody's doing cluster sets that they do them for every session within that week or just this is an occasional thing you could do it this could be your training strategy yeah absolutely so you can really take it that seriously um in fact like if you look at again the weight lifters they will do cluster sets by default not even trying still say they'll do like a clean and then they'll drop the weight back out they're supposed to be doing say a set of three but almost always they're gonna like shake it out re-grip and then pull it again and sometimes they're set of three takes like a minute and then like you hear it's funny because it's like like a I set a triple PR you're like no you did three singles like what's the difference between doing three singles and a set of three when you took a minute between each rep um I love that community so yeah I mean it could be your strategy like it could be like hey for this five-week block this is all my training especially for your compound movements if you're gonna go to start doing some of the smaller movements Maybe you give up on that um it could also just be something you do for your one primary exercise for the day so do that thing that is the most important first and just do it for that one and then the rest of them you can kind of ditch it if you need to save a little bit of that time it can also be something you do by feel so you know you're two reps in and you go God like I'm not feeling like poppy here like re-rack it catch my breath for a quick second and do it so it doesn't have to be ultra planned I guess what I'm doing is is I'm giving you an excuse to make sure you're super fresh for every rep it matters the last one I want to talk about here is what's called Dynamic variable resistance so Dynamic variable resistance is uh fixing the problem we have with What's called the human strength curve so theory of constraints again you're only as strong as you are in your weakest point of the movement so depending on the the movement you do this happens at a different range of motion well the deadlift has used this example it's also because we've done like research in my lab using this stuff on the deadlift so I can speak to it very directly when you go to pull it off the ground some people are going to fail right at the bottom meaning they won't get the weight off the ground at all some people will feel just below the knees that's likely kind of like the hardest transition period and then some people will feel right at the top just before they can lock out okay great so what that means is at some point of that lift you're going to only be limited by your strength in the weakest area all right so if you have a constant load on the bar in those other two parts of the range of motion where you are not the weakest they are never truly being tested for their maximum strength because they're always being limited by the previous one and this is the same argument that we would get into if people ask about should I what do you think about using straps right strapping your hand to a bar for deadlift things like that there's pros and cons here there are times when you want to use a strap and there are times when it's a bad idea so what dynamic variable resistance is is either using things like a heavy band or or chains on the bar if you've ever seen people do that so in my lab we actually have a force plate on the ground and then we have built-in basically hooks in the front and back so we can actually set a barbell on top of the force plate where you stand on it and then run bands from the back to the front running over top of the weights and so when you stand up as you're going up vertically the bands are getting Tighter and Tighter and pulling the weight towards the ground so the weight is getting heavier and heavier as you stand up so as you start to gain mechanical advantage in your positioning you start to increase load because the bands are getting Tighter and Tighter and Tighter so this allows you to train that full part of the strength curve and to challenge your stronger areas with heavier weight and your weaker areas with lower weight you can do the same thing with a bench press you can do it with a squat and any other exercise variation and dynamic variable resistance is incredibly effective for a number of things you're going to give up a little bit because the total load you can put on the barbell is lower because you're going to be adding you know in large cases several hundred pounds of band tension and so it pros and cons so it's always a game it changes the curve but it's it's a very good technique um that that people is fairly easy to implement it's fun in fact if you try this on on a bench or a squat you're gonna be the first time you give it a go you're like oh my God because the bands are pulling you all over the place um so you have to get very stable very quick um been shown a number of times a handful of studies out of many Laboratories to be a very effective training technique a little bit more advanced but I want to throw that in there for the folks that are maybe just tired of sort of doing the same barbells and doubles and machines and you want to try something different a very effective technique sounds like fun yeah it's great with your permission I'm going to "

            "text": "a topic that occupies the minds of so many youth young men but also a lot of women I think one of the really interesting progressions that's taken place in the last decade or so is that far more men and women are using resistance training in order to evoke hypertrophy growth of muscles for aesthetic reasons and for all sorts of reasons what are the ways that people can induce hypertrophy so not to correct you or insult you but probably a better way to think about that question is really what stimuli do I need to give the muscle to induce hypertrophy now there are hormonal factors that are important there are nutritional factors but just to stick with the context of training this is really going to frame a lot of our answers and as you'll see it's one of the reasons why I call hypertrude training kind of idiot proof in terms of programming now the work is hard difficult and all that but the Precision needed is a lot less than what we saw in power and strength and so if you note there like it's very important that you do it in this style with this intent and with with these Within These parameters and if you're outside the parameters it's not going to be it hypertrophy has a very broad range in terms of your actual applications and this is why you have and will continue to see countless styles of training that all work I mean I know you were mentored earlier in life by one of my favorite people in this entire field Mike menser like just an absolute character his style was completely different than what you would see in a classic textbook or any number of different influencers or coaches or individuals and if you've ever thought thought to yourself like why is it all these programs work and people love to jump to things like well that's the steroids like just get that out of the equation for now independent of that right that's not even part of the equation you're still going to see results and the question is like why well that's because what's driving changes in strength and Power are the adaptations of specificity what's driving changes in hypertrophy is much more well-rounded and so you have options to get there remember you're training a movement and now you're training a response and a muscle that caused the growth that's very very different so if we look at like the classic Dogma we have to basically challenge the muscle to need to come back in this case specifically bigger and the nutrients need to be there to support that growth okay the nutrients aside perhaps we can come and a few more minutes and talk about that so all we really have to do is going back to our our dogma of activation of something on the cell wall we've talked about this earlier that's got to induce that signaling Cascade that's got to be strong enough to cause the nucleus to react to it to go to the ribosomes to initiate this entire Cascade of protein synthesis okay so that signal has to be one of a couple of things either has to be strong enough one time it has to be frequent enough or it has to be a combination of these things all right so I can get there with a lot of frequency and a moderate signal I can get there with very low frequency and a large signal like more akin to what you did with Mike back in the day I'm sure and still trained that way still training each muscle group mainly once a week directly and once a week indirectly so all you can all you have to do there to not fail is to make sure the training is hard enough and it's going to work if you choose the frequency path then you actually have to make sure you're not training too hard to where you can actually maintain the frequency the only wrong combination here is infrequent and low intensity and low volume that's it as long as one of those three variables is high you're going to get there because the mechanisms that are needed to activate that signaling Cascade are wide ranging and this is why when we even see things like Blood Flow Restriction Training right this is when you put like a cuff on your arm or your leg and you block blood flow and you use no load or as low as say 30 of your maximum and you take it to fatigue failure that actually is an equally effective way of inducing hypertrophy despite the fact that you know you're using three five ten maybe most 20 to 30 percent of your owner at Max why because you went through the route of metabolic disturbance okay other ways say a higher load maybe as heavy as you can for say eight repetitions is going to get through what's called mechanical tension and so there's there's these different paths that we can get to the same spot now eventually these things have a saturation point so you don't need all three of these mechanisms the third one of course being muscle damage or breakdown and I and I know we want to chat a little bit about that but none of these three are absolutely required you can have multiple of them in a session um you don't have to have breakdown at all that is a complete uh well really it's a flat out lie that you have to break a muscle down to cause it to grow that's just not needed at all you have to have one of these three things though and so again this allows you a lot of flexibility which is why crafting your program which is best for you is actually fairly simple when it comes to hypertrophy you just have to make sure you do the work and you want to make sure you have a few standards in place with the exercise choice and some other things that will um we'll hit in just a second but that's really the fundamental way of getting to it making sure either that signal is loud enough or frequent enough to give the nuclei a convincing enough reason to spend the resources because you have to remember two things in order to grow new skeletal muscle you need amino acids which are your supply and then you need primarily carbohydrates as the energy source to power that synthesis process so you remember basic chemistry that says if you're going to take two atoms and you're going to pull them apart or put them together right that's going to take energy typically and in most of actually metabolism uh when you split a bond you're going to get it's called exergonic you're going to get energy from that but when you put them together that's going to take energy this is why we call that protein synthesis right so you have to convince your nucleus that one invest those resources in energy primarily carbohydrate but number two and more importantly invest that Supply there's a ton of possible ways to get energy but there's a very low amount of amino acids available and you need them for many more things than just taking your biceps from 17 inches to 18 inches right it's not going to do that if you're in a position where again you can't sustain an immune function if red blood cell turnover needs to be higher or any of the other main like tons of things that you need proteins for so you have to be able to say like are you sure you really want to spend these resources and build it in a muscle because once we do that it's very difficult to go backwards break them back down and bring the amino acids back into the to that availability pool so we can use them for either another function entirely or even another muscle group that's called protein redistribution by the way when you say maybe you don't do um a lot of upper body work in your training and you're not eating enough protein or a minimal amount and you're doing a lot of lifting in your legs you'll you'll notice your legs will get larger but that's actually a lot of times you're pulling the protein from say your upper body in this case and redistributing it back down um to the quads so that's the way you that's what you have to get to and in terms of application what numbers to hit we can go through each one of our modifiable variables just like we did with speed and strength and power and walk through some of our best practices in each category yes so I'd love to talk about those modifiable variables as they "

            "text": "relate to choice of movements order of movements volume so sets and repetitions and frequency of training and I'm particularly interested in frequency of training because that relates to the so-called split where typically one is not training their whole body every workout although there are I'm sure hypertrophy workouts that um our whole body workouts but where people are dividing on their body parts on onto different days so uh would love to go through this list one by one starting with exercise Choice cool great so in the previous section we pretty much said exclusively choose your exercises by the movement patterns and you want to balance between pushing and pulling and rotation and things like that in this particular case you have the option to do either here's my recommendation most people default almost exclusively to Choosing by body parts here right I'm going to do calves and shoulders today and chest and back whatever combinations of things they want that is clearly effective strategy however many Studies have actually been done where you choose by movement patterns and that is actually equally effective now one little caveat I actually should have said a few minutes ago when we talk about the research on muscle hypertrophy it is important to distinguish the fact that the vast majority of This research is coming from a novice to moderately trained individuals there's actually more and more research coming out on trained individuals but that's still moderately trained right even those ones so what happens in those people that are actually way past that point we don't know scientifically it's very difficult to do research there so that's an important caveat I will acknowledge when I say hey you don't need to do this or you have to do this you're assuming a training status of moderate to low may or may not be true past that we don't know scientifically I have certain thoughts personally but the science will only take us that far so that being said you can actually choose by muscle or by movement pattern here whichever is is your personal preference and this is actually where you can act just become a good coach whether you're coaching somebody else through this fitness journey or it's yourself and give them a little bit of autonomy so maybe you select the first three exercises and then let them select one every day and so if they especially want to make sure that one muscle group grows let them Target that muscle and maybe the rest of the day you've actually split it up as Push Pull or something else like that all those strategies are effective personal preference as long as the total amount of volume on the working muscle is equated throughout the week which we'll get to those numbers in a second then you're going to be in the exact same spot no problem I would actually generally encourage people to choose exercises in a variety of Fashions I actually think that it's important that you do some number of combination of what we call bilateral and unilateral exercises so bilateral being think about it like a squat where bi meaning two lateral you have two feet on the ground moving in sequence here unilateral is one so this could be something as simple as a rear foot a limited split squat it could be a single leg leg press or single leg curl it could be a pistol squat something where the the individual limb is moving one at a time you need to have a combination of bilateral and unilateral trading that's good to do for strength as well probably not super important for power but I'm also very important for making sure for hypertrophy's sake you're not getting any imbalances as you progress especially through months and years of training so make sure you're doing a little bit of a combination whether you want to pick specific implements that's really a methods question and a preference question then it is Concepts so dumbbell great kettlebell fine barbell awesome band doesn't matter body weight none of these things are as important because all you're trying to do is create a certain insult in the tissue and the Implement is just whichever one you feel best doing it and this is where actually machines come into play a lot machines are greatly underappreciated they are a fantastic resource especially somebody who's either early in their fitness journey or somebody who really is having a hard time targeting a muscle group with a bigger compound movement so when you're choosing exercises for hypertrophy you're going to want to start with those bigger compound movements that's going to be drive a lot of the adaptation you can get to these single joint movements like a little bit later but having said that because of of the way that people move differently their bomb or their anthropometrics and their biomechanics and even their technique the same exact exercise will not necessarily work the same exact muscle groups for multiple people so if you and I both went and did a back squat um if you did a little bit more of what we call a high bar squat so this is the bar is literally sitting up higher up on your neck you're keeping your back more vertical and because in order to do that you shift your knees much further past your toes keeping of course your whole foot on the ground in good position okay that's going to generally put more of an emphasis on the knee joint right and so that's not a bad thing you tend to see a little bit more work in the quads there a little bit less work in the spinal rectus and back because you're actually not supporting the weight horizontally which is a diff it's a much more difficult position it's vertically stacked okay if I were doing the classic low bar squat which is again lowering the bar down my further down my back towards uh one more like my shoulder blades I probably take a little bit of a wider stance and when I squat I drive my glutes back further away from the midline in as in fact as a general rule if you take the midline of your body the thing that moves is the farthest away from that midline is likely to be the thing that's activating the most so in the case of the of the front squat you're not generally going to be using your glutes as much if you're in that are not even front side just that high bar squat where you're very very vertical your knees are going to be moving very far over your toes which is fantastic therefore it's a little bit more knee dominant as can we say it the other version here you can keep your shins really close to Vertical you move your butt backwards you're going to have to then lean forward with your torso which means it'll be more low back more glutes and a little bit less knee now that's a general statement it's not necessarily always true but as a guideline there that is one exact exercise where you may be going man I'm trying to improve this clear weakness I have in my quads I can't even leg extension my body weight I have a significant problem there so maybe in your particular case if I'm hammering you or you're hammering yourself in a squad exercise and you're wondering why your quads aren't getting any stronger or growing in any size it may be because of the style of the movement so I may need to go Andrew all right look squats in general if you look at the research are an excellent exercise for Quad development but for you they're not because of the way you stand or just because of you know neural activation it doesn't matter so I need to take you to a machine and isolate that muscle group so we can make sure we see development in that so if you're trying to grow a specific body part area individual muscle it's very important that you're actually seeing progress there and don't worry about well in the textbook the bench press is supposed to be good for your PEC because if you're not actually moving the right position or depends on the angle in which your sternum actually sits in your body a bench press may actually be doing very little for your PEC and you may need to adjust to say an incline bench or a decline bench or a PEC fly so machines can be fantastic at letting you isolate without having to worry about things like stability your low back position getting hurt where's your neck at you can really concentrate on just the movement concentrate on the muscle and let everything else kind of go away and ensure you're getting training in that specific area those are excellent recommendations one thing I want to ask about is prioritizing specific body

            "text": "parts and therefore specific exercises and here I'm not necessarily referring to trying to bring up a so-called weak body part you know an area that tends to be either genetically deficient because in some cases I learned for instance having seen a lot of competitive track and field championships I love watching track and field as a spectator up to Hayward Field in Oregon whenever there's a meat oh sure I really love that the sprinters are amazing um they have some of the highest calves in the world that I've ever seen I mean like little like little micro Cavs but they're fast as hell they're right behind the knee and they have a very long distance between that calf and their foot which makes it propulsion excellent right they wouldn't stand a chance as a competitive bodybuilder but because something different is being selected for in bodybuilding but obviously they're they're magnificent for sprinting most people of course reside somewhere between the extreme of you know very long muscle bellies from you know origin to insertion or very very short muscles usually people have one or two body parts parts that they want to emphasize for whatever reason you know these days it seems to be people are really what are they saying now like glutes to the new biceps or biceps are the new glutes or I don't know anyway you see this stuff I love them by the way I am so Pro curls in the squat rack there you go love it right there you go so nobody kill me so everyone has their thing but the that they would like to emphasize but I have a question because we're specifically talking about hypertrophy which is should people give themselves permission to not train a body part if their goal is balanced hypertrophy I'll give a couple of examples one of the reasons why I for instance not done a lot of free weight squatting is because despite my quadriceps being rather weak according to you um they tend to grow rather easily relative to other muscle groups and the goal for me has always been balanced development yeah and so I emphasize hamstring work and I emphasize a you know calf work and hamstring work um it's not that I don't train my quads at all but I do far less for them and I avoid the big compound movements for them I I occasionally do them and what again this is not about what I do or don't do but I think that in the context of a conversation about hypertrophy is it appropriate to give people permission to say listen if you're just genetically you know strong large lats doing a lot of chin-ups and rows might actually be the worst thing for you if your goal is balanced development and I um I ask because I don't often hear anyone any you know credentialed people give people permission to completely avoid training a given body part if their goal is balanced development and yet I think most people who are resistance training are seeking balance development I don't know anybody that actively wants to have big upper body small legs I think that comes from neglect and laziness in most cases sometimes injury related or other things but um I think this is an important point to raise that any good program for hypertrophy I would think would have to take into account people's genetic and natural variation um sport based variation in which muscle groups just tend to grow easily for them and which ones require a lot more focus and work yeah absolutely you first of all you have permission to do or not do anything you'd like to do in terms of of hybrid tree I generally wouldn't not recommend disregarding a muscle group entirely I know that's not what you actually suggested but just to make sure that people didn't hear it that way um what I would do is in this example is I would continue to do those big movements I would just keep the volume low so I might do two sets or something uh twice a week there's a whole bunch of reasons you want to make sure that those motor patterns are there you want to make sure that the the especially the benefit of these compound movements is you get to work so many complementary muscle movements at the same time so in the case of like loaded squat you're not only working stability in the hip as well as the knee but you're also working upper body uh your your rhomboids are keeping you in position your neck has to stay in position your toes everything is working and so it's really difficult to get those things when you take that movement out and you replace it with say a a machine hamstring curl that whole element of balance and neurological control is very very important to maintain over time and that just gets removed with if you go to machines only so I would keep some of those things in maybe even not all year round but maybe one quarter of the year two quarters every other rotate it something like that as long as it's getting you're not if the reason you weren't doing say those squats was uh because you're like ah it hurts my backers okay great then leave it out but if it's just simple you don't want your quads to go too much I would just keep that volume low and do something just to kind of touch it keep it activated and to maintain all those other things like flexibility range of motion I would bet anything your adductors are probably underdeveloped right now you can get those by doing your squats because you're not really doing I'm sure in much adduction training and so this things like that that just get lost when you're only thinking all big muscle groups that that come inherent in doing the larger movements and so you don't have to worry about them or train them separately I appreciate that and in reality I do two to three really hard work sets of hack hack machine squats per week which is plenty for me to maintain and even get a Little Bit Stronger but per our earlier discussion about a year ago I shifted to doing very low repetition ranges to main strength in that movement there you go but I am actively avoiding hypertrophy in that muscle group yeah or another solution would actually be do something like one set to failure a week not even extremely long just you know do something in the 8 to 15 repetition range um at the end of all that strength set and just get a little bit of pump there and then and then just so just so that those muscles can touch that level of fatigue touch that level of strain and mechanical tension walk away great thank you for that what about exercise order amazing so implicit in this exercise Choice thing "

            "text": "it's what you're going to notice is these modifiable variables interact with each other right and you can clearly see how when we talked about volume and to clarify volume is the repetitions multiplied by the sets that's typically how we express the volume well that's going to be directly influenced by intensity the heavier load you put on the barbell the less repetitions you can do and the inverse right rest intervals the shorter you keep your rest intervals then either the lower the weight has to go the intensity or the lower the rep range has to go order is the same thing choice is the same thing so all of these things modify each other they play a little bit of a hand and what everything else does so with the exercise Choice thing rolling into exercise order you get to play a couple of games here when we talked about strength and power I basically said stick to the big movements most complicated and compound movements first you don't have to do that with hypertrophy you can do this in a couple of ways you can do the thing you're just simply most interested in first you can do this thing called pre-fatigue so say you're you're going to do a back day you could go in and do nothing but isolated biceps as your very first exercise and then roll into your your pulling movements because what you'll see is during most pulling activities the biceps are a secondary or tertiary muscle group but you've pre-fatigued them you've guaranteed that muscle of most interest God it's it's most training in and everything else is secondary so you can start if you want with single joint movements you can start with isolation stuff or you can start with compound stuff either way it just really comes down to preference and what you're specifically trying to develop now this also goes back to the exercise Choice question right because it's sort of the same thing right like what which one am I choosing and where I wanted it the campus was the exercise splits and and so we just sort of talked about am I doing body part splits and I know a question I get a lot here is well which ones should I package together I'm not really concerned with it what you all you should worry about is how many times per week and in fact total volume you achieve on a muscle group per week and I don't doesn't really matter how those things are folded in it's really a personal preference issue one mistake that we see here commonly is grossly under appreciating that the legs are not a muscle group right so the legs have a whole bunch of muscle groups in them so we see a classic split like I'll Do shoulders and chest Monday and then I'll do you know biceps and forearms Tuesday and then legs Wednesday or whatever and then back to upper body and then I was like you're like wait a minute you have four days dedicated to the upper body and one for quote-unquote legs well like you hopefully you can see the imbalance what's that's going to happen there over time is you're going to do it do far more upper body than you are lower body and that's not appropriate so you just want to think about your lower body like you would do if you're going to do body part splits then include those things as well and they'll just chunk everything in as legs once a week if you want to do that that's actually okay but that day has to be very very challenging and you probably should do quite a bit of volume um there because you're almost surely not going to hit the total weekly volume needed to optimize muscle growth if you're literally only doing once a week of your quote-unquote legs so along those lines Let's Talk Volume yep how much volume does each muscle group need per week in order to generate and for that matter maintain hypertrophy right so the kind of a minimum number we're going to look for here is 10 working sets per week correct per muscle group correct and just to make sure that everyone's on the same page if I do a chin up or a pull-up I'm going to mainly be training my back muscles my lats if I'm doing it correctly lats and rhomboids and biceps right and a few so but they'll be indirect targeting of the biceps so would you include indirect targeting so for instance if I you said 10 sets per week let's just use biceps because it seems that that's the go-to uh generic muscle for what why is that by the way that when people ask somebody to you know Flex their muscle they always Flex their bicep they don't flex their calf or their quad or their glutes or something I guess there's some um you know public decency issues I can tell you uh with my children that's the very first muscle I taught them to flex their glutes no they're biceps and and good um good uh healthy parenting advice from Dr Andy Galpin so if it's 10 sets per week for biceps in order to maintain or further grow the biceps but does that mean if somebody does 10 sets of chin-ups or 10 sets of chin ups and rows that they are checking off any of the boxes for biceps assuming that they're doing the movement properly yeah and targeting the major muscle group that a given movement is supposed to Target which in my mind when you're doing a chin up you're supposed to mainly be using your back muscles and then there are secondary muscles or secondary activation of other muscles but of course some people their arms grow like crazy when they do chin ups and their back doesn't grow at all so this is where we're back to the kind of um genetic preloading of the system yep um if you will so how does one meet this 10 sets per week minimum when dividing different body parts and thinking about this direct and indirect Activation so two things there's no specific exact rule here and this is why these set ranges are ranges right and this is why we don't say like 10 is so 10 would be sort of the minimum number you want to get to the more realistic number that most people especially if you're Advanced or even intermediate is more like 15 to 20 working sets per week okay now if you're very well trained you probably want to even push more towards like 25 and in fact past that there's just not a lot of research so the optimal number may be 30. we don't we don't really know it's just hard to get that much work in um it may actually be detrimental and here we're referring to Natural athletes that is people who for whatever reason either because they're not taking any prescription drugs or maybe if they are whose levels of steroid hormones mainly the androgens like testosterone Etc do not exceed the normal reference range values either because that's what they are naturally or that's what they're replacing through pharmacology whereas when we think of technically someone could be taking exogenous hormones to replace a deficiency and then there's still a normal range okay but I just want to clarify because you work with athletes a number of different sports where drugs are and are not tolerated Etc and the general population that what we are talking about here is for the general population not for steroid using athletes correct okay yeah great so um so Ken was just sort of that like absolute minimum number to maintain which is actually pretty cool if you think about it this way uh if you went in and you did three sets of ten it's a very three sets of ten repetitions correct you're already at three you do that three days a week you're at your nine that's almost ten if you also just went to the gym one day a week you did three sets of ten and you did three exercises you're at nine is that working sets you're basically done so achieving 10 sets per week per muscle group and now we're not even talking about indirect activation of a secondary so you're going to hit 10 fairly easy um extension to that hitting 20 is actually still not that hard because of what's actually going to happen there so in your example if you're doing your chin UPS well would the biceps count there's no exact rule there because uh there could be technique issues it could be hand positions so you mentioned chin up very specifically a chin up is actually going to put your hands in in this position where your palms are facing up right this is supination and pronation so you're gonna be there well that's actually quite different than a pull-up or your hands are in the opposite direction so a chin up actually is going to be pretty good activator in your biceps for most people um so you would expect actually to probably count that because it's going to be very difficult to not see some fatigue in your biceps depending on your mechanics depending on and by that I mean just the the segment lengths of your bones right that's where your muscles or originate and insert there's been something you can do about it's not even a technique or a focus issue it's just simple fact the matter that's how you pull best in that area the position in which your hands are on the wider grip more narrow grip it's going to change muscle use so we talked about earlier I think in the previous episode that exercises do not determine adaptations applications do but exercises do determine things like the movement plane The Joint you use and typically The Eccentric concentric sort of ratio as well as oftentimes the muscle groups involved so there's just not a lot of things you can do depending on how you are built of you know some exercises activating a secondary group and you don't want it so it's not always a technique you it may just be that's how you're built right and the same could be true for a squat the high bar versus low bar sort of example we talked about earlier it's you know you you could see plenty of evidence on muscle activation studies where people even doing the vertical back squat style have tremendous glute activation and folks doing the the low bar have tremendous quad Activation so a lot of it depends on personal mechanics so what I counted is the question really you just have to ask yourself number one do you really care that much you know you have a range to get to if you're anywhere between 10 to 25 working sets you know you're fine so if you count it or don't count it it's just going to change the difference between whether you did 17 working sets or 23 and either way you're fine so I don't really care number two are you actually feeling anything there so if you're doing your chin ups and your biceps are blowing up I'm counting that right if you're doing it you're like no I don't feel any fatigue there it's all my then I'd probably say okay we're not going to count that as towards it so um you can just let that guide you a little bit towards your account yeah I've always noticed that there are certain muscle groups that are very easy to isolate yeah when under load and those are almost always the same muscle groups that are easy to contract very hard without any load whatsoever Bingo you know that's actually really insightful so um you can kind of use this heuristic of like if you can contract your lats just standing here you're probably going to contract them very well when you lift if you can't you can probably assume about the same thing's going to happen so uh yeah you'll know um this is actually the lats are actually really interesting because they tend to be one of the more difficult muscle groups to learn how to activate so if you're in your journey you're just like I have no idea and um you can look up like a lat pose so how do you like how do you puff your last how do you show it and if you do that and you're like wow there's no movement here just recognize that's extremely common and that is probably going to take you many many many months of trying before you start to see some movements and probably even a few years before you really start to see Activation so you're not some sort of like specific like special genetic anomaly it's very very common it's uncommon to not be able to activate your biceps right that everyone can do that but if you're just like man I can't get this here I'm just going to stop doing it do not do that just keep at it and just keep concentrating and thinking about that muscle group it will take some time it's very common to have challenges activating Lots yeah I've noticed that many of the muscle groups that were responsible for a large fraction of the work in the various sports that I played as a young child are muscles that are very easy for me to selectively isolate and induce hypertrophy in um I suppose I'm one of those mutants where my lats happen to be one such of those muscle groups but I think that's because I swam a lot when I was a kid literally going to ask me a swimmer yeah that's like a Telltale yeah every every kid in my town swam and played soccer there you go and then later I you know I skateboarded and did something you generally hear that answers you either were a swimmer or you're a wrestler so it's like that pulling and pull toward you is thousands of repetitions allowed you to get very good at Contracting but because um I also played soccer and skateboarding but I didn't do any baseball basketball or football muscle groups like deltoids are very challenging to activate nicely yeah so I do think that early development is superimposed on a genetic template that sort of predicts which muscle groups are going to be easier or harder to isolate and train it's also a very good case for why it's important to do as many different athletic activities as you can in your youth yeah and if you do skateboard definitely learn to ride switch because every every skateboarder I know has one leg that's larger than the other one calf that's larger than the other and actually for that matter um people that do martial arts that don't learn to um if they're not Southpaw if they don't learn to switch up and do their uh their work Southpaw you see the same thing I mean you're building an asymmetry into the system and it's not just muscular it's neural oh strongly neural yeah um so yeah kids um parents get your kids doing a bunch of different things I suppose gymnastics would probably be the best sport all around in terms of movement in multiple planes and activating all the different muscle groups uh yes and no there's a lot of benefit no question about it there's a lot of other things though that it that has limited abilities so um almost everything in not like gyms is great but almost everything in that is pre-planned which is a major downfall right so the joy of skating is there's so much proprioceptive input that you have to make decisions very quickly um in in small Windows now you have a little bit of that when you're flipping in the air you have to land but you gymnastics gymnasts tend to have a very specific routine that they're working on and they work on that routine for years so um for me was Transportation it was freedom and it didn't require any coaches or parental oversight yeah yeah Ball Sports have the beauty of reaction and things like that so all of them are wonderful um yeah good to do a lot of them you've established that 10 really to 20 sets "

            "text": "mentioned some pretty broad repetition ranges how many repetitions per set is required in order to induce hypertrophy yep so there are two caveats here before I give well the number is somewhere between like four to 30 reps 30 repetitions absolutely in fact I think you can go much higher the first 20 have to be feel exceedingly light correct and during those first 20 or so repetitions is the goal still to contract the muscle as hard as possible on each repetition so this is the caveats here so caveat number one is there is an assumption that by the end of this set you're getting somewhat close to failure and so you don't have to go to Absolute failure to to induce most like perjury but you you also have to get kind of close so if you're going to do a set of 25 and you finish it and you're like oh yeah like that was kind of starting to get hard at the end that's not going to be enough if you're going to do a set of five or six and the same sort of expression comes out of your mouth it's not going to be up so in that case it doesn't matter your rep range if you're not getting somewhat close to failure again it doesn't need to be complete failure um a good number to think about is like minus two which is what we call reps and Reserve which is sort of like I got within two or so reps of failure and then I stopped and can we Define failure at least for sake of this portion of the conversation as the point at which you can no longer move the resistance could be your body could be yeah a weight machine Etc that you can no longer move the resistance anymore in the concentric phase of the exercise movement in good form correct that's a really nice momentary muscular failure is how we typically Define it there's a wonderful review I think it's open access that just came out in the last handful of months Eric helms's team out of New Zealand Eric's is a great scientist and a very experienced physique coach and a competitor himself so he knows a lot about this area and that paper rent through all the exact definitions in detail all the caveats that we're not gonna have time to get into today so I would recommend folks like check that out if they want more information but I'll try to get the highlights of it right here so what they basically showed is going all the way to failure in the defining failure like you just did right so momentary muscular failure you can't complete another repetition through complete range of motion through whatever range of motion you determine prior to as well as with good technique so other body parts aren't being compromised sort of Etc and doesn't need to be total failure that minus two failure is still needed in caveat two which is again very very highly trained individuals you won't see people who are like Eric or other folks who are six to eight to ten years in a very serious training um who don't have to go to failure probably a little bit more than what I just said so the the layout that they brought in their paper was very nice and they basically said okay here's a couple of scenarios in which going to failure is maybe the best way to do it number one you probably should do it on a little bit of the safer exercises so maybe taking your back squat on a barbell to complete failure and doing that as like a standard protocol multiple times a week it's maybe not the best choice so maybe if you're going to do barbell back squats you take that to your you know your your one or two reps in reserve stop there it's a lot of work it actually going back to our discussion on the prolapin chart it's a similar idea right where you're going to spend most of your time in these working sets 70 to 90 sort of percent and then you're going to take that failure to maybe the hack squat machine or maybe even the leg extension machine so a little bit of a safer exercise they also can tend to be single joint exercises don't have to be but they're just ones that are not as complicated and you're not likely to injure other body parts when you're doing it all right um so that's one one way to go about it another way to go about it is simply doing it on like the last movement of the day right and so again you're not going to do it on your first three or four exercises but whatever your last finisher is you'll hit total failure on that one and that kind of keeps you in a range of yeah you hit some failure you got a lot of overall work done so that's a lot of stimulus that's a lot of noise going to that nucleus that says grow grow grow but you didn't totally obliterate yourself especially if you don't have the assistance of anabolic steroids right that's very very important if you have those you can push this a lot harder because your recovery would be significantly enhanced if not you kind of want to walk away from that I have to assume that you know 99 of people are saying this do not and um and and yet among those who are not taking anything in terms of anabolics they're I think is a large range of recovery quotients out there some people just tend to recover better some people I think also are far more diligent about what I would call the um necessary but not sufficient variables of yeah adequate sleep yep uh proper nutrition limiting stress and and so on yeah I can't wait to break all that stuff down I got a whole got a very long discussion for all those things we will get into it in all its practical realities and actionables before long what about rest between sets great this is the interplay now so one actually thing we said for a long time is you want to stick between 30 to 90 seconds of rest between sets for hypertrophy and that's because you're trying to um activate this metabolic disturbance or disruption you'd need a little bit of a burn a little bit of a pump to go there more recent research a lot of this out of Brad show on Phil's lab and others have shown that that's just doesn't seem to be the case again for moderate uh to newly trained individuals whether that's the case for the highly trained folks I don't necessarily know I don't think there's any difference here so you can take up to three to five minutes of rest in between sets and be fine the caveat here though is this if you're gonna rest longer that means the metabolic challenge is lower so you need to then increase the challenge in either mechanical tension which think about as weight load or muscle breakdown so you can't lower one of the variables keep everything else the same and expect the same result so if you're going to have more rest then you need to either preserve the load on your bar or the volume one of the two has to happen so this gives people a lot of opportunity I generally tell people if you're going to train for hypertrophy it's probably best to stay in a two minute range at most you can go longer but a lot of people have a hard time actually coming back and then executing that next set with enough intent to get there and or it's going to make your workouts tremendously long so you can stick to the shorter one you don't have as much mechanical tension but that's okay you can still get there but in reality of it is you can do whatever you would like tell me if this is a reasonable structure given what you've told us three exercises per muscle group first exercise slightly heavier loads so repetition range is somewhere between let's say five and eight with perhaps hitting failure close to it on the last set rest periods of somewhere between two or let's let's get wild and say five minutes okay so it's a little bit more of a strength type workout at that point but then moving to a second exercise of three or four sets where the repetition ranges and now 8 to 15. shortening the rest periods to 90 seconds or so and then on the third exercise repetition ranges of 12 to 30. this number 30 kind of it makes me wide-eyed I know that can't remember the last time I did a set of 30 thinking it was for hypertrophy but what you're saying makes absolutely senses or is research back so very short rest intervals maybe 30 seconds between between sets would that allow somebody to Target all three forms of major adaptation I mean my in my mind it works you know you're talking about mechanical loads you're talking about stress and damage and you're talking about metabolic stress is that better than to for instance do all the high repetition work in one workout per week um and then higher loads in the other workout it doesn't matter if you divide them up or combine them it would not matter I would say it matters in the sense of your personal practical situation well long rest for me I love training heavier with longer rest right but I'm hearing that there's real value to doing these higher repetition ranges yeah so the formula you set up there in a second is great if you want to do it the other way that's fine you really it's kind of idiot proof you can set this up however you'd like you could actually do the inverse theoretically you could do the sets of 30 first and then move to your sets of eight it doesn't really matter because we're trying to just get to a certain total stimuli and you're going to hit it eventually so you have a lot of room to play here you also have a lot of room to adapt based on your circumstances God I'm short on time today typically my workout takes me 60 Minutes for this plan I have I've only got 35 today what do I do well if you're training for strength that's a different answer than if you're training for hypertrophy if you're training for a purge fee you need to make sure you hit that total volume so in this particular case lower the load lower the rest intervals and just get to the burn and get going as much as you can if you're training for strength I would rather you cut your volume in half get those few repetitions done at that high load and just don't do very many sets today that's a better result so the goal that you're going after is going to determine what we call chaos management which is that thing like that um running out of time today my time is short or I didn't even think my time was short something got cut off I'm not feeling it today I'm in a hotel etc etc etc which is life right that's going to be 10 to 50 of your workouts is going to be chaos management well how you make those decisions is going to go back to understanding number one what goal you're going after the number two what are the physiological consequences we call these physiological limiters for each one and that's going to tell you what to select and prioritize the volume the intensity or whatever else I'd like to ask about "

            "text": "frequency but I'd like to frame it a little bit differently than that I'd like to ask about total workout duration which dovetails with frequency because if one is hitting the appropriate number of sets per week and one is combining different muscle groups on the same days well then workouts are going to be a very different duration than if one is doing a different body part each day for instance and so I feel like any discussion about frequency has to be within the context of workout duration and vice versa yeah if you are a a lifting junkie and you're very consistent in your schedule I'm actually okay with body parts but most people are not that and so the concern there is if you say are isolating and waiting to do your glutes on one day of the week and something happens on that day you might go another 13 days now before training it you know between workouts and that's really difficult to maintain the frequency won't be high enough unless the load and volume on that one day is astronomically high it's just not going to happen so while if you look at the research frequency in terms of how many days per week doesn't matter that much as long as the total load and failure are equivalent practically it's a challenge so it's hard because life gets in the way for most people especially if you have kids and a job and all these things over there so I actually prefer doing something more like three days a week of total body and if something happens you've just missed that body part for 48 hours 72 hours I like that a little better for most people not because it's more effective but just because it's a little bit more resilient to life and you can get there if you wanted to actually do a little bit of a combination so if you wanted to do like two days a week of whole body and then two days a week of a little bit of a body part split then you're actually sort of hedging against all risks there as long as you get to that total number there now there is actually some evidence in a couple of ways that maybe a little bit more frequently is a little bit better but the difficulties now we're going back to the practicality question of like how many people really can train just their strength training six days a week that doesn't count any of their long duration stuff it isn't other high heart rate their flexibility their okay it's just really really really hard to get all that stuff in so it is it tends to be easier on folks in terms of execution and long-term adherence in my opinion to get that volume accomplished in in a little bit more frequent patterns but not once a week so I like to kind of have it right there for most people not again not because it is technically more effective because you're less likely to fail to progress because of skipping a workout something popping up your power going out and your you know garage door being locked on your whatever imagine that that happened to me this morning folks couldn't get out of my driveway because the gate with the electronic gate was uh down because the power was down anyway solve that problem yeah the way you describe it my sense is that workouts will last somewhere between one and two hours of real work is that about right it doesn't have to be nearly that long I mean you could certainly get enough the work done in 30 minutes if you're doing a whole body workout yeah yeah absolutely so if you're doing that three days a week so remember the numbers we're trying to hit here let's say we're trying to hit 15 working sets per muscle group per week that's five working sets per day for muscle groups so if you did one exercise for that day let's say you did squats you did five sets you did that three days a week you're done there's your 15. but there are other muscle groups to hit on the same day you're doing squats if you're doing a whole whole body yeah so you've gotten them all ready and so like all the leg muscles in that example are taken care of uh so you would not do separate hamstring work you wouldn't need to now hamstrings is actually a little bit of a caveat like that's a good example of an exercise or a muscle group that's probably really good to make sure you isolate it's challenging to get with your standard uh dead lift and and the squat it's one of the probably ones that's most important to go Target outside of that but in theory theoretically though outside of that you would get most of your leg muscles done with even a single exercise and even if you wanted to change it up so you said all right Monday I'm going to do a squat variation uh Wednesday the next day I left I'm gonna do some sort of deadlift hinging variation and then maybe Friday my third day I'm going to do some sort of unilateral maybe rear foot elevated split squat or something like that all right maybe even a lateral lunge maybe a different plane okay you're in a pretty good spot you're going to hit most of those muscles um to your 15 working sets especially if you take sort of that last set each day so pretty close to failure that's going to get some more serious work done but you're not going to be so fatigued you can't come back and train it a couple of days later and you'll be fine so you could even split that up into two days a week and now all you really have to do is hit something like seven working sets so maybe that's two exercises per day maybe some sort of a leg press and a leg hinge you know three to four sets each you can hit six to eight sets that day you did that three days a week now all of a sudden you're at that 20 24 sets but same thing with the upper body I just gave lower body examples because you know I like the lower body more so it's not that challenging to get to those numbers and split and those workouts can be extremely short so if you're if you're doing that three days a week um you know you're getting you're doing that one exercise everybody one exercise lower body that certainly shouldn't take more than 40 minutes I'm happy to hear that not because I don't like training yeah please please excuse the double negative but I found that resistance training workouts that extend longer than one hour of work and certainly longer than 75 minutes of work leave me very fatigued oh sure and fatigue to the point where concentrating on cognitive work throughout the day can be challenging need a longer nap in the afternoon I'm a big proponent of naps in the afternoon in any case but requiring longer naps in the afternoon Etc so at least for me restricting the resistance training workouts to about 50 50 to 60 Minutes of real work yeah for me three or four times per week has helped tremendously so it's a case where doing higher intensity work in a shorter period of time and actually hitting muscle groups less frequently for me that's again once directly once indirectly yep has worked really well and as you mentioned earlier this could very well be explained by not my recovery quotient as some sort of genetic or physiological variable but the way that I'm training and indeed I like to do a few four straps and go to failure on too many sets and you know I've weaned in the in that genre of training it's also fun like to just train hard it is it's really fun it is I think that um I've learned a lot by training to quote unquote to failure of course I think there's a lot of learning in there provided it's done safely but what you're describing actually inspires me to at least give a try to these other sorts of splits and and ways of training for hypertrophy and strengths because this notion of not necessarily having you go to failure and still being able to evoke strength and hypertrophy adaptations is a really intriguing one uh dare I even say a seductive one and that leads me to a question that is "

            "text": "based on findings that I've heard discussed on social media which means very little if anything unless it's in the context of people who really um know exercise science and you're one such person and that's this idea that because resistance training can evoke a protein synthesis adaptation response but that adaptation response is lasts about 48 hours before it starts to taper off that the ideal in quotes frequency for training a given muscle group for hypertrophy is about every 48 hours is that true yes and no so a couple of things there remember in order to grow a muscle there's multiple steps here so you have the signaling response which actually happens within seconds of exercise and can last depending on the marker you know up to an hour or two hours step number two then is gene expression and we see that that's typically peaked around two to six hours post exercise and then you have following that protein synthesis and that's that longer time frame somewhere between 12 hours there it's certainly not peaked for 48 hours it may be still there 48 hours from now but it is is absolutely coming down at that point depending on sort of a number of factors so that part of is sort of true so this is a combination of like some half truths and some like maybe just pedantic things that aren't really that important to differentiate the real question I think is is like okay is it okay to train sooner slash is it better to train sooner or actually is it better to wait longer there's no real reason to think that you need to train if the goal is hypertrophy any sooner than 48 hours afterwards I can't think of an advantage that that would confer I I also can't think of any practical applications athletes physique bodybuilders coaches that ever found tremendous success doing that so I would be very skeptical that that is anyway better now could you do it in some instances of say you know you've got travel coming up like that so that you just yeah you want to preload the system by destroying the muscle no problem and then waiting seven days or 14 days I've known people have done that before I do Vacations or layoffs every time like every single annihilate themselves and then take a two-week layoff yeah and it's like there's no benefit there other than psychological like I just love it like it feels great to be super sore I feel less crappy not training for those couple days because I'm like I'm super sore anyway you need the extended rest yeah of course and it's just like it's just a crappy justification in my brain that like excuse to do something really wild and that I totally don't need and get way sore that I should get Dr Andy galvin's suggestions of what not to do but that he does yeah 100 so do as I say not as I do the famous words of every research Professor yeah I think 48 hours is a reasonable time uh to wait can't think of any advantage of going sooner than that there's really not a tremendous amount of advantage of waiting much longer than that certainly 72 hours is fine as long as you're hitting these Concepts we've talked about you can let really life determine that I mean there's situations too with like particularly our athletes where we have to kind of break that because of schedule obligations they're playing every fifth day every third day or something like that you're just gonna have to lift some back-to-back days you're just gonna have to get it done um but yeah I can't think of why I'd go out of my way to do that the second part of that question is let's say somebody trains a muscle they train it properly they hit it in the appropriate rep ranges and appropriate rest Etc that the stimulus is there the adaptation is set in motion they're getting someone where somewhere at 48 hours or so a protein synthesis Peak that's going to taper off yeah but they don't train it 48 hours later or 72 hours later they train it five or six days later not because they're lazy not because they um they don't care but because they have other priorities that are woven in with getting hypertrophy in this muscle right there are people who exist only to get hypertrophy in a given muscle group but let's be fair most people would like to grow that muscle group but then does it necessarily mean that the muscle starts to revert to its pre-hypertrophic state that is does it atrophy and get smaller again because if it doesn't I could see a lot of reasons for hitting a muscle group once every five days or seven days provided you hold on to the hypertrophy that you initiated five or seven days ago yeah there's no reason to think you will lose anything in that sort of a Time domain five to seven days the only challenge with training that infrequently is can you actually get enough total volume done so if you're going to train them also once a week you either have to go to real failure real damage and soreness or you have to figure out a way to hit 20 cents that day in that muscle not at all impossible especially if you're thinking well actually all I have to do is 15. I'm gonna do five sets of three exercises that's not outrageous not at all so so like absolutely possible if you're wanting to go more towards 20 we're getting closer to that 25 like now it starts to get pretty challenging so scientifically the research will suggest it's going to be equally effective practically it's challenging for people to hit sufficient volume without just being so demoralized afterwards because they're in so much pain they can't get out of their car because their legs are so trash they can't sit on the toilet and get back up without crying from pain so that's not good no that's not good I say that because those are actual examples that have happened in my life yeah I I I'm realizing as we're having this conversation about ways to stimulate hypertrophy that I've sort of defaulted to more intensity as opposed to volume because of the time factor I have a lot of other things going on in my life and So within that hour I Can't Get Enough sets in across all the muscle groups I need to hit and I'm only going to do it about once a week and so it's at least for me more advantageous to just train extremely hard I actually use the pre-exhaustion technique that you mentioned before yep or pre-fatigue as you refer to it of hitting something really strong with an isolation exercise then doing compound exercises I'm starting to think based on what you've told me that pre-fatigue and then a compound exercise in some ways it's not really two sets because if you're going to fail your four straps you're kind of pushing past failure then you're doing a compound exercise and you're doing that two or three times well that sounds like four to six sets but the force repetitions are almost like an additional set right yep and so it's not 20 sets but it's four to six really really hard sets that go beyond what we normally think of as a set totally okay it's sort of the difference between running on concrete and running on Sand when I go for a sand run it's a very different experience totally yeah and this is why I should have mentioned this at the very very beginning of our our chat today but all of these numbers that I'll give you for any exercise adaptation you you cannot think of them as hard lines they are gradients and so when we think about the number for hypertrophy in terms of repetitions I said 4 to 30. what do you think happens at three do you think hypertrophages stops in fact the number you'll see in literature is more like six to Thirty I actually slide it down to four though like personal preference because of that but it just Fades away what do you think happens at rep 31 35 there's no it just Fades gradually over time so you actually sort of brought this up one of your other questions and I'm not sure if you were even thinking about this or maybe you were I just babbled on about something else but if strength happens between this like one to five repetition range and hypertrophy typically happens in this like 8 to 30 range what happens if I were to do the sets of six or God forbid seven like seven and nine are these numbers you just absolutely don't do in strength training right it's just like so that's a one two three four five six got eight ten twelve like do not program a set of 30. now when I'm trained sets of seven to nine yeah it's great uh we'll use sets of seven a lot with weightlifters because you can actually count numbers more effectively but what happens in seven to nine right so this is actually a wonderful area of these like five to eight repetitions where you're going to get a nice combination of a lot of strength gains and a lot of hypertrophy so someone who's coming in going man I want to get stronger and I want to add muscle what do I do here well that's actually a really nice answer train pretty hard in that like four to eight repetition range and you're going to get a lot stronger and you'll still induce a lot of hypertrophy if you want to really maximize hypertrophy I would probably spend most of your time in the 8 to 15 repetition per set range you can go up to 30. admittedly though I don't think it's optimal to spend most of your time at more than 15 reps per set it's very challenging to maintain the focus required at rep 27 to actually get sufficient failure by rep there you just you just give up way too early it's hard to do the same thing at the bottom end of that Spectrum in terms of of really heavy to get there so I really honestly think 8 to 15 is still it's cliche it's that textbook number but it's a reason that's a like it is tried and true and very very very effective if for instance you want to get stronger though and not invoke a lot of hypertrophy you have a couple of tricks you can pull number one stay south of that five repetition range you do sets of one sets of two go as heavy as you can with all appropriate considerations and stick within maybe even up to three reps per set you start getting to four to five to six now you're gonna start itching towards that that hypertriot range so stay down there do a lot more total sets so do a classic example would be something like eight sets of three right you're going to get a lot of practice you're going to get 24 very high quality reps with a lot of rest in between okay you go from there you go to managing caloric intake making sure your protein is still on point you want to recover but if your total calories aren't um you know greater than 10 to 15 above your maintenance needs then you're not going to be able to put on a whole bunch of muscle mass because you just don't have the fuel for it you can also then space your workouts out so that stimulus isn't coming extremely often so if you do that thing a couple of times a week it's not enough frequency in that signal so remember that signal has to be frequent or loud you didn't make it super loud and now you're not making a super frequent you can get very very very strong like that and and put on very low amounts of vibratory if that's sort of the choice so you told us a lot about volume and "

            "text": "frequency and how that relates to protein synthesis and Recovery to evoke the hypertrophy adaptation response how should people think about systemic damage and Recovery because obviously the nervous system and the way it interacts with the neuromuscular system is the site of all the action here or at least a lot of the action and the nervous system can in fact become fatigued you know that has a great capacity but the whole system that we're talking about can be worked to the extent that even if a muscle group like the biceps or the back is being allowed to rest while you're training legs and other muscle groups that your whole neuromuscular system needs rest how does one determine whether or not your entire body needs complete rest or or low level active rest or exercise of a different kind yeah yeah sure so I want to actually tackle this because we're on the topic of hypertrophy I'm assuming that that's the goal in mind here yes here I'm asking specifically within the contracts of hypertrophy I realize that for other training goals the answer of this question could be quite different yeah okay so we actually do this in a couple of different ways let's start local and work back to systemic right because number one what you're really concerned about is at the local muscle level is am I going to create excessive damage and I don't necessarily mean muscle damage I mean injury right so um the kind of rule of thumb we use is like three out of ten in terms of soreness if you're more than three out of ten in terms of soreness we're going to start asking questions if you're higher than six out of ten we're probably not training this is subjective total subjective measure right and you'll you'll know very quickly right I feel like if you can barely graze your PEC with your fingertip and then you're like ah I don't care what you score that we're not training there's just no damage if you're three out of ten if you're just like oh I'm kind of like a little bit stiff here but once you get warmed up you start feeling okay you're probably okay to proceed there so that is is a very easy way to just think about soreness you're going to be a little bit tight depending on your training frequency now zooming out to systemic we use a whole host of things so we actually have a a whole host of biomarkers we use you can get a lot of these from blood so you can look at things like creatine kinase that's the very common one marker of muscle damage um we'll actually look at LDH we'll look at myoglobulin that's just like if you think about hemoglobin is the um is the molecule that carries oxygen throughout your blood the myoglobin is the the part of that that's actually in muscle so when muscle gets broken down that gets leaked out and put in your blood that's one of the markers actually it's gonna be associated with things like rhabdo which is uh like you're going to see your urine is purple and it's extremely dark because you've got so much muscle breakdown that that happens and kidneys can have a problem and you put a bunch of stuff in there so we use those biomarkers we'll actually also look at probably a couple things you're familiar with alt and ASD these are excellent biomarkers of muscle breakdown so if we are actually suspecting that this is a chronic problem we're going to actually go and pull some blood if it's just like I'm super sore today we're going to use that subjective marker but if we're seeing this as constant like man are we really pushed pushing you way too much is there some sort of systemic problem we're going to blood and we're going to look at all those different things now AST to alt is really specific and I don't want to take us too far off track here but the ratio to those things is actually very important as well so if you look at the AST to alt ratio typically the number we'll look at is like 1.67 as that ratio is like higher than that you have a pretty high risk of muscle damage but really between you know me and you and a few of these listeners anytime we start seeing AST out kick alt we're immediately thinking it has a ratio being higher than one we're immediately thinking like there's something happening muscle damage wise so um that's actually a sneaky good indicator of just total muscle mass because the vast majority of that's going to be in muscle so those are actually some markers that we like a lot if muscle damage is the thing we're concerned with if we are more concerned with things like total training volume systemic overload then we may turn to something more like sleep there's a lot of information we can actually get gland from changes in sleep behavior and function you could also look at things like HRV heart rate variability which is a very classic marker and much more sensitive to changes with training than something like a resting heart rate which is which is one thing you can actually do that's totally cost free just look at your changes and any elevation resting heart rate over time especially more than three to five consecutive days it is an indicator but HIV is much more sensitive to things like training induced overload so that's a quick version of stuff that we're going to pay attention to the last one I would add there is simply motivation so if you're really training hard and you like training hard and you just like cannot force yourself to go anymore that in of itself can be a good indication of it's maybe not the day maybe not the week with all of these things you want to be careful about overreacting to a single day measure again we look we need to look at at least a trend of more than three days honestly I'm looking at more than five days I'm gonna pull back from that and think about what phase of training we're in what part of the Year we're in typically with our athletes we're in season preseason post-season off season Etc to make our decisions about what we're going to do about it are we canning the entire workout are we doing a modified lower version lower intensity my default generally if hypertrophy is the goal remember volume is the driver there so if I can like can we get in can we go real light let's go to 6 out of 10 rpe so relative perceived exertion maybe we'll reduce the range of motion maybe we'll make it a little bit easier maybe go to machines or instead of going a squat we'll just do you know uh leg extension something like that but I want to still get enough volume in there that will keep you on target any again even going at 50 not not to high repetition you know 50 for a set of ten three sets just get a nice blood flow in there get it in get it out aid in recovery and then move on and come back the next day that's probably what I would do rather than canning the entire session how do other forms of exercise "

            "text": "combine with hypertrophy training for instance can I do cardiovascular training for two or three days per week provided that cardiovascular training is of low enough intensity and not disrupt hypertrophy progression and can I do that cardiovascular exercise before or after the hypertrophy training or does it need to be separated out the answer to this is really what we call the crossover air interference effect okay it's really an energy management issue so the only time endurance exercise starts to interfere or block or hinder attenuate hypertrophy is in one of two broad categories number one total energy intake or your balance is off so you can ameliorate this by just eating more if you do that then the interference effect generally goes away the second one is you want to make sure you avoid exercise forms for your endurance training that are the same working group and specifically The Eccentric portion so for example we see much more interference with running unlike hypertrophy then we move cycling right less eccentric pounding and loading less damage less things to recover from the tissue seems to be totally fine the only other thing you need to worry about here is total volume of your endurance work so if you're doing a moderate intensity for a moderate duration say 70 of your maximum heart rate for 25 minutes it's unlikely to do much damage in terms of blocking hypertrophy you're totally fine can you do it before or after your workout it's probably not going to matter that much all right so pre-fatigue is okay for hypertrophy so if your pre-fatigue is coming from endurance then you're totally fine not a big deal afterwards cool you want to break it up into multiple sessions that's probably better right so if you do your endurance work on a separate day that's probably best case scenario if you can't do that but you can break it up into two workouts say you lift in the morning and then you do your quote-unquote cardio at night maybe that's second best third best is doing it at the end of your lift and finishing it that's fine just make sure that you're maximizing your recovery on all the other tricks we'll talk about later make sure the calories are there make sure you're not doing a lot of eccentric Landing in that endurance stuff and you'll be just fine and where does higher intensity cardio fit into a hypertrophy program so higher intensity cardio for instance in my mind is getting on the assault bike and doing um you know eight intervals of 20 second Sprints and 10 second rest in between or perhaps go into a field and doing some bounds and Sprints and things of that sort not going all out not you know running for one's life but getting up to about you know 85 90 percent of of running for one's life so we have a lot less information on the potential interference or not of high intensities of it um the stuff we do have suggested it may actually Aid and hypertrophy and that's because if you think about it one the potential paths to activation and muscle growth is this metabolic disturbance you're going to get that a lot with the the high intensity interval thing so it's not a terrible thing to do I wouldn't do it to the level that it compromises your ability to come back and do your primary training so if you're so fatigued your legs are super heavy and they're depleted you now have to ingest extra carbohydrates to replenish muscle glycogen to be able to handle both recovery and continued training Etc that could then lead to a problem but in general we really don't see any reason why that is going to completely block or or make it such that your training was quote unquote wasted or it didn't work in fact actually um a very recent study came out where they had individuals perform six weeks of purely aerobic endurance steady state long duration endurance for six weeks I think prior to starting a hypertrophy phase compared that to individuals who did not do that and those folks that did these six weeks of just I think it was cycling actually just endurance work had more muscle growth at the end of their hypertrophy training than those folks that did not so this shows you very clearly there are a lot of advantages that come with being physically fit to Growing muscle so folks that also have actually hit plateaus a lot one of the things you may actually see some benefit from is actually doing a little bit more endurance work whether it's a steady state stuff maybe a side the higher intensity stuff certainly if you're starting a training phase it's a pretty good idea to do that and there's a number of physiological reasons of why that's potentially occurring but the the lowest hanging fruit here is weak sort of joke you know like if you're so unfit that you're tying your shoes in your warm-up and you're already breaking a sweat you probably don't have enough Fitness to do enough training to get enough hypertree so that is in fact your limiting factor you're not recovering you're super fatigued and damaged and sore because you're so unfit so get fit first and then you can actually get more gains a week later so you have to kind of Kick the Can down the road for a few weeks but 10 weeks later you'll be in a better spot than you were by investing a little bit in your conditioning so as you pointed out before and I can only assume "

            "text": "you're referring to me hypertrophy training is idiot proof meaning there's a lot of leeway in the variables but not so much leeway that people can do anything it it's bounded by these general principles so with your permission I'm going to do a brief overview of my notes based on your description of the modifiable variables that will direct somebody towards hypertrophy keeping in mind this backdrop of exercise Choice exercise order selecting appropriate volume that sets and Reps training frequency and needing some Metric or way to have progression either by adding more weight or by more tension or more metabolic stress and so on in terms of exercise Choice it sounds like the choice of exercises is not super critical in terms of specificity yeah but that the ideal circumstances that people are targeting all the major and frankly secondary and minor muscle groups if you can even call them that yeah across their exercise choices that they're picking exercises that they can perform safely and that they can generate enough intensity so they're getting close to failure without placing themselves into danger right so um for some people that might mean including large compound free weight exercises like squats and deadlifts and bent over barbell rows as well as isolation exercises and for some people there might be a biased toward more isolation exercises and machines but of course machines don't necessarily mean that you can't use heavy loads in fact plate loaded machines like Hammer strange machines it will allow for quite substantial loads so picking two or three or more movements per muscle group can be valuable but that overall consistency is going to outshine variation in the sense that you don't need to hit muscles with a different exercise every workout coming back to the same things has a benefit and we heard about this in our discussion around strength and power as well okay in terms of order of exercises there too it sounds like there's a lot of flexibility one could do the large compound exercise for let's say quadriceps and hamstrings and glutes first like a squat or a front squat or could deadlift for that matter but then if one deadlifted and primarily hit the glutes and hamstrings then you might want to Target the quadriceps more directly with leg extensions or if one squatted and was loading that squat bar carrying the squat bar in a way that was predominantly quadricep yeah and less so glute and hamstring than leg curls would be a good choice Etc okay and train your calves folks very important unless you're a genetic freak of course it's actually a good opportunity to say unless you're a genetic freak or you just have a genetic predisposition yeah or you've done Sports and and you have a genetic predisposition that gives you you know very large caps that don't require any training at all I I know people like this they're they're somewhat rare but they're out there yeah and those folks sometimes want to stay away from or minimize their training you told me that even if you have a muscle group that's a hyper responder in terms of hypertrophy getting at least one or two good hard sets per week is good because you want to keep functionality in that neuromuscular system love it okay in terms of volume again we have a large amount of variation is what I'm hearing that the total number of sets per week is a strong driving force of program design and selection that ideally you're performing 10 to 20 and probably more like 15 to 20 sets per week and that could be divided up across multiple workouts or done in one workout but that's 10 to 20 sets per week per muscle group not really taking into account indirect Activation so that would be 10 to 20 sets for biceps your back work is going to hit your biceps a little bit maybe a bit more depending on the exercise selection but it's really 10 to 20 and given that hypertrophy can still occur and maybe even occurs better with more volume yeah then don't include the indirect work unless something about the architecture of your body and the inability to engage certain muscle groups like makes the a pull-up really an arm exercise for you do I have that right the way that I would maybe Define it is typically with movements we consider to be there to be primary movers secondary movers and then tertiary right if it is a primary or secondary I'm probably counting it if it's tertiary or less I'm probably not counting it got it so going back to our example of a pull-up so an example of a pull-up I probably wouldn't count the biceps in a pull-up but I would probably count the biceps during a chin up would you count the rear deltoid in a pull-up probably not maybe like uh it just depends um probably not though okay train the rear delts also that's only honestly the reason I answered that is because most people don't do anything for the real adults anyways but they should right absolutely that's why I didn't want to count it I wanted you to go out of your way to make sure you did something specifically for the real rear delts for Aesthetics and for functionality for health and and balance across the shoulders totally neck uh shoulder all of it I'm so happy to hear you say this I'm a huge fan of people doing rear deltoid work for all the reasons you described n network for that matter I think people forget that the neck is the upper part of your spine yeah yeah and for postural reasons and for stabilization safety reasons it's really critical but I think most people aren't familiar with how best to train the rear deltoids and neck and I know a number of people are afraid of getting a big neck which for reasons that are still unclear to me is referred to as no neck but let's leave out that no neck comment for the moment what are some good exercises for targeting the rear deltoids and neck "

            "text": "briefly touched on this but anyway from I believe six repetitions all the way up to 30 repetitions but probably more in the 8 to 15 repetition range for hypertrophy most of the time yeah and I'll just throw in there because I love this idea that if you want to get a relatively balanced adaptation related to strength and hypertrophy that seven to nine range the the No Man's uh or Dan no woman's uh land of of training repetitions I always joke in class I'm like okay we go through the whole thing right you're like one to five strength eight to twelve you know I perch reading like right and then I'm like okay so six to nine means nothing will happen at all the kids are just like writing it down like right a good way to for everybody to remember that there are adaptations triggered in the six to nine rep range and it's a balance of strength and height you'll just get thrown out of any gym that I'm a part of fantastic if you do that uh so but the important point is to get close to failure and occasionally hit failure maybe occasionally throw in a forced repetition or a rest pause where you rest and then do a few more something like that but those intensity increasing Maneuvers will require a little bit more attention to recovery either time or or attention in some other way and here's a little bit of care and I'll throw at people because people generally don't like to be told to not go to failure that often right so there's a handful of like half the folks are like sweet I don't have to train that hard to get there and those folks it's like well yes but I also said you just can't like do a half workout you have to get pretty darn close to failure and most people don't really know what failure means so for that group it's actually it's still probably harder than you think you want to train the other group though that like wants to completely blow themselves out every single time dragging them back is more the key now for those folks here's what I can say if you make sure that your hidden stressors invisible stressors are completely taken care of you can go to failure a lot more often and so you need to dial those things in and then now you can go hammer yourself because you'll recover so much quicker and we see this very commonly in all of our programs with our athletes and our non-athletes that when we get the rest of the Hidden invisible stressors taken care of their training volume goes up so much because they'll just start coming back and they're like oh my God I'm not sore anymore oh my God I'm not nearly a sore I did this exact workout you know countless times before and now I'm doing it and I'm not sore at all anymore what the hell like we didn't do anything different with the programming or really the nutrition but we got the rest of that allostatic load under control and boom things take off it's a lot like drivers so many people seem to be riding the brake and so many people seem to be heavy on the accelerator yeah that's actually one of the ways we describe it is like you want to go faster people's inclination step one is to hit the gas our our step number one is making sure your left foot's not on the brake you'll go faster with less resistance which means you'll actually wear down the system a lot slower by just taking your foot off the brake first if you're then not going fast enough now we can push the accelerator but I'm not pushing that accelerator while your foot's still on the brake you're going to go a little bit faster but not as fast as you should be going with that much work and you're going to start wearing down brake pedals and things like that so I like the analogy so hitting that 10 to 20 sets per week repetition range is pretty broad provided you get close to failure hit failure every once in a while could be the final set of each exercise or maybe do one workout where you hit failure on everything but then you don't do it for a few more again there it sounds like there's a lot of play in the system here rest ranges anywhere from 30 seconds all the way up to three or four minutes depending on how heavy you're training and how close to failure or to failure maybe even quote unquote Beyond failure if there is such a thing you're training um throwing in negatives and things like that we didn't get into really high intensity techniques but people again vary in the extent to which they're pushing the system but there does seem to be some value to mixing up the rest between set ranges across exercises and across workouts but you could combine them all in the same workout as what I heard yep and then in terms of progression it sounds to me like the goal when hypertrophy training is not necessarily to add more weight to the bar although that's one way one could do it but that the progression actually can arrive through this really extensive kit of changing the speed of movement changing um the number of sets adding some volume maybe changing the split so that you go from a three day a week full body workout to more of a body parts one or two body parts per day every other day or two on one off at any number of different variations that are out there sounds like all of these can and will work provided that people are obeying the general principles of this uh hypertrophy adaptation inducing protocol that you described and that they are meeting the necessary but not sufficient variables as well such as sleep nutrition and managing the stress in the rest of their life do I have that correctly yeah that's really really good uh one more thing I'd like to add is this is a situation for hypertrophy in which there are some exercises that I actually don't think are good ideas so I want to make sure we included those in the conversation that's not necessarily the case for strength you can really do kind of whatever one you want and that is specifically Plyometrics although in fact if you look at there's a recent review paper came out showing that like Plyometrics are effective as well right just like one can do almost anything as long as it falls within this parameter set the concepts are few and the methods are many and the methods for hypertrophy are many many in general though Plyometrics are not my first second or even like 100th choice for hypertrophy they if they're a part of a total training program and you get some of our purchase as a result cool you're lucky not the first place I'm going the other major category are weightlifting variations so that when I'm saying weightlifting I mean specifically Olympic weightlifting as in Snatch clean and jerk and their variations those are just not a good exercise Choice it's not that they don't work it's just the risk to benefit ratio starts to fall pretty fast and in the negative favor and so it's just not worth doing sets of 10 of a snatch unless you're in a sport where that's like the competition or whatever but if the goal is simply hypertrophy choose different exercises than that great now I realize that we are going to do "

            "text": "entire episodes related to nutrition supplementation recovery Etc but I'd like to just touch on two or three specific topics and questions that come up a lot around the question of hypertrophy specifically and that probably also relate to strength training and training for Speed so I'm going to ask these in um not rapid fire but I'll give you shorter answers we'll put it that way so I will ask these questions now but with the caveat that we will get into these topics in much more depth yeah very soon the first question is about the use of cold showers and Ice baths and cold water exposure which I know many people use for resilience training to increase their dopamine which it does and for recovery but there's also this issue of when one should use cold that is deliberate cold exposure relative to hypertrophy training specifically and that's because I've heard that if deliberate cold exposure is done too soon after a hypertrophy adaptation inducing workout yeah right all the sorts of things we've been talking about that the hypertrophy response can be blunted reduced or eliminated is that true and if so when could people do deliberate cold exposure while still also including hypertrophy training in their program and still get hypertrophy great so you know I'm a lover of the cold I still have a deep freezer in my house that is filled with water at all times that is plugged in and is a frozen chamber I still do the old school style of it please unplug it before you get in it oh yes absolutely and then don't do it by yourself so that the lid can close on top of you and then we don't see you sort of ever again the Han Solo effect it's time for me to upgrade and get one of these new fancy ones but I've been using this for so many years so I love it obviously I've been involved with xpt and and Gabby and Laird and Brian McKenzie and these folks so I've been doing this stuff for a long time I've but I don't even know how many hundreds of folks in the ice and a lot of reasons so there are a lot of benefits and we could talk about those later however that that being said it is very very true you do not want to get in the ice post hypertrophy training you wouldn't want to do that immediately after the workout you probably don't want to do it before the workout and you probably don't even want to do it that same day it's just not worth it it will blunt I apprecially in specifically we've talked earlier about what's driving muscle growth is that signaling Cascade through that gene expression through that muscle protein synthesis cold exposure blocks that signal remember adaptation comes from stress you've put in a stressor in now you've blocked that stress you've literally blocked this signal that tells your body come back and grow larger size so not a good idea to do it if you're training for some other purposes maybe strength maybe there's an argument there although maybe not for Speed and power maybe get away with the endurance maybe a separate conversation if you're in season I have no problem using it immediately after a game the goal is entirely different even if we did a hypertrophy type of training program we're not doing it try to try to maximize growth in that particular case our priority for Recovery is higher than our priority for muscle growth so we choose optimization in that category you can only make those choices though when you truly understand what is the goal for the day the week the month the phase of training and really what part of the year you're in we have that all plotted out for for all the people we work with so I know when we want to choose one over the other it's not a this is the choice you always make such a nation that's just not how we operate we need more Precision than that so that being said we're generally not going to do it if we want to do a lot of icing during a phase in which we're using a lot of hypertrophy we're going to do a couple of things number one we may just not use it so there are phases in our training where I don't want to maximize recovery I'm not going to give you any tricks here I'm not going to do ice or any of the other methods we're going to talk about why because the whole point is to cause overload that's what's going to be the stimuli to cause adaptation if all I'm doing is blocking that stuff attenuating it smashing it back down I'm undercutting myself I'm choosing to feel a little bit better to have a little bit better performance right now knowing that's going to compromise the results I'm going to get 6 8 10 12 weeks from now all right so I'm not going to choose it at all in reality of it is if I really am trying to maximize hypertrophy I'm probably not doing any ice work through that whole phase maybe like my off day I know that's similar to a setup you have like one day a week when I'm not training we'll jump in some ice maybe even do some hot cold contrast I love the xbc protocol it's you know you've probably talked about it before that's a great setup or just not do it at all right it's just not something we need when we move into another phase of training where we're trying to maximize adaptation or maximize the result and and get the benefit of that training now we're going to hedge more towards recovery and we're going to bring in some of these strategies and techniques and not worry about causing the most stimuli there because we're trying to add attenuator because we're trying to actualize the work we did 6 8 10 12 weeks before what about cold showers do those have the same hypertrophy blunting effect in general no in general you can do cold showers that's not going to be a problem you're not going to be in there very long and you're not going to get nearly as cold as you will submerge in 30 degree ice water for like that the way that we do it nonetheless so I have no problem standing in the shower for a couple of minutes using it for other reasons if you want to that's no issue I'd like to talk a little bit about "

            "text": "nutrition and supplementation as it relates to hypertrophy Dr Lane Norton who's been a guest on the Hebrew and Lab podcast and we both know throughout a number range related to protein intake on the backdrop of how much protein synthesis can occur by meal across the day Etc a lot of a lot of research done there and some important work by him in particular and then the value that he threw out was 1.6 grams per kilogram of body weight being the lower end of the range up to I believe is it was as high as 2.4 maybe even as high as 2.7 grams of protein per kilogram of body weight per day that's a pretty broad range but it's on the higher end of what I think most people think of in terms of protein intake and then again some people might already be right there or maybe even above that value now of course this all depends on whether or not people are omnivore vegan uh meat based Etc we won't even go there but assuming people are getting enough protein per day so somewhere in that range and they are spreading out that protein intake to accommodate the fact that the body can only assimilate a certain amount of protein in any given sitting what do you like to see people ingest at some point post hypertrophy inducing workout in order to get the protein synthesis Advantage if you will yeah that is stimulated by that workout earlier you mentioned the you know the post-training feeding window that you know in the 90s and probably earlier people were talking about oh you know within the first 90 minutes you have to get 30 amounts for a while yeah was it 30 minutes of excuse me a certain number of grams of carbohydrate and protein Etc I think now the understanding is that that window is much broader um and how broad and Etc is still a matter of debate but when somebody is training specifically for hypertrophy assuming they are getting enough protein from quality sources in their other meals and assuming that their overall macronutrient intake and caloric intake is high enough that is they have enough of a caloric Surplus that they have the the raw materials for for hypertrophy what do you like to see people ingest at some point post-workout in order to facilitate muscle protein synthesis and recovery and this could include nutrition and supplementation or if you want to divide those answers out feel free to do so of course yeah okay great so a ton of work came out of Don Layman's lab it was actually a Lane's Mentor as well as Stu Phillips at McMaster so a ton of work there and we can answer a number of things here so Lane's numbers that he recommended uh also known as about a gram of protein per pound of body weight it's a great start now once you slide below per pound right one gram per pound right in earlier which is also making sure because we're changing units here uh it was 1.6 grams per kilogram of body weight all the way up to I think it was 2.4 but maybe a size 2.7 yeah grams of protein per kilogram of body weight so 2.2 in that unit would be the same thing so 200 grams per kilogram is the same as one gram per pound right so depending on which where you're listening at to this at one of those may be easier than the other for you if you start getting below that number now you do start running into questions of protein quality protein type and protein timing this is one of the reasons why I actually fully agree with Lane is just get that number higher than you think and then all those other variables don't matter if that number is low then you need to start paying attention to a bunch of other stuff you've added now complexity to your program things you got to pay attention to just stay high and it doesn't matter and so you can just leave a lot of those things off the table that seems to be fairly clear in the work of some of this gentlemen I just mentioned that as long as you get to that total number the question about timing and types and quality it seems to matter a lot less in fact uh Stu's recent work in non-animal-based proteins it really showed that to be fairly clear that those are quite effective assuming total protein intake is high enough the amount of leucine and other amino acids in those actual proteins matter less if the total threshold is just super high so just do that and you're fine now the other caveat we have to say here is timing of macronutrients is seems to be somewhat Irrelevant for protein but that is not the case for carbohydrates so that timing does matter replenishment of muscle glycogen is very specific and you want to make sure that that is around a lot if you're doing either maintaining training quality or you're sliding into endurance type of work and so nutrient timing does matter with carbohydrates maybe less so with protein and certainly less so with protein if the total protein ingestion is high enough so um it depends on what we're going after in terms of a training goal and where we want to get with all these things in general the way that we like to think about this is if you're doing a strength type of work where you're truly targeting that then a one-to-one post exercise protein to carbohydrate ratio is generally what we're going to go after so this would be something like 35 grams of protein and 35 grams of carbohydrate it doesn't have to be post it can be pre or my favorite is actually mid or post but somewhere in that range especially if you're training in the morning and you have not consumed anything prior to your workout and that's not necessarily eating in the middle of the workout that's drinking calories yeah yeah it's going to be able to see someone eating a sandwich on uh in the gym although I'm sure it's happened yeah so one to one is that like sort of standard number here um if you're going to do sort of more of a really hard conditioning workout that number slides up to something like three or even four to one which would be carbohydrate to protein ratio so if we want to stay at 35 grams of protein we're going to go maybe as high as like 100 or 140 grams of carbohydrate again depending on what type of of training we're sort of doing if you're going to do a little bit of a combination then you like a little bit of strength a little bit of conditioning and kind of a standard workout which is probably something that a lot of people will do then you maybe want to go to something like two to one so you know 35 grams of protein 60 70 grams of carbohydrate and those are kind of just like rough numbers that you can go by and for Pure hypertrophy training would you like to see people ingest some carbohydrate post-training for Pure hypertrophy training I want to see that as many of those nutrients around the training is generally possible now again I might change my mind when our fasting study comes out but as it stands now there is no advantage to not fueling around the training and there are some known and some other potential advantages to fueling so I just see no reason to not do it um in fact most people are generally going to do better now this is not science this is just my coaching experience and this is with our athletes and all of our non-athletes that we've worked with and do work with they're just going to be better spreading those meals out generally throughout the day and they're going to be better if they have those nutrients either pre-mid or post and so they're going to get even for my Purge fee they're going to get something like that one three to one ratio of carbs to protein personal preference some people don't like to eat before they train some people have to eat before they train some people can't you know put in food in their belly immediately after work around that you can you can play based on personal preference but we want that fueling in there because we want to maximize the potential growth and we want to just get a jump start on recovery because we're going to be training again pretty soon supplementation is a huge topic and one that we will go into in great depth in a soon to occur episode but if you had to pick one supplement that can benefit most everybody if not everybody yeah for their training directed toward strength power and hypertrophy what would that supplement be and how would you like to see people use it meaning how much should they take and when should they take it sure if you don't count protein and carbohydrates as supplements they technically are but we'll just walk out of it right sorry I I should be more specific I'm not referring to a non-food form um protein and carbohydrates so powdered protein and part of powdered carbohydrate Etc um technically are supplements they're highly processed but they're um but I'm not including that I'm I'm referring to um non-macronutrient type supplements yeah does testosterone count um well in the context of this discussion it's uh testosterone that people are manufacturing themselves ah okay the cheating kind the endogenous kind no um I mean creatine is the answer here without question it is the most well studied it is the most effective and its uh benefits are robust meaning they're going to confer positive adaptations across multiple physiological domains and we can certainly have a very long chat about some of the interesting things that people in fact we just had um during candel um on our Barbershop podcast and he went into extensive detail about all the benefits of creatine that people have no idea about including things like bone mineral density you asked about that earlier creatine is actually fairly effective for that let alone the thing the benefit in things like cognitive function decision making memory um the work that that's being done there for neurological disorders um depression a whole host of things that that creatine is being studied for some of those studies show a lot of benefits some of it show maybe a little bit some none but there's just a lot of things creatine can do so when we could talk about Muscle Recovery or muscle hypertrophy um that's where the bulk of the research is and it and it's very effective in terms of type creatine monohydrate is still the best one and that's just because it has the largest evidence base you can maybe make some arguments for some other types but you're really going to reach saturation pretty quickly within a matter of weeks and there add a dosage of anywhere between like three to six grams per day now five grams is the very standard number we give reality is I change that number based on size that's just the honest truth um if you're 225 pounds you're not going to get the same dosage of creatine as 125 pound girl that's just like this is not what we're going to do so we may slide that number down a little bit closer to three for the the smaller girl boy it doesn't matter it's just female physical size if you're one of our 275 or 330 pound offensive right tackles in the NFL you're not going to get the same dosage as everybody else so that number is going to go up to seven eight nine maybe even 10 grams a day I'm there so that's just kind of the scale in general if you wanted an easy answer five grams is the standard taken after training the timing doesn't matter totally irrelevant take it in the morning of breakfast take it at night take it anytime you want take it pre we tend to put it in a lot of people's workout um shakes just to make sure they get it in throughout the day but the timing is irrelevant great well thank you for that very informative answer and I look forward to much more discussion about nutrition and supplementation and recovery and all the rest in the episodes to come this was incredibly informative thank you so very much I appreciate the opportunity I had a great time doing that I love talking about these things I also really like talking about what we're going to get into in our next conversation which is the physiology of endurance metabolism and fat loss if
