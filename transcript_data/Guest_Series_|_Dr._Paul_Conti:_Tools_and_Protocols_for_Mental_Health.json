            "text": "Andrew Huberman: Welcome to the\nHuberman Lab Guest series, where I andan expert guest discuss science and\nscience-based tools for everyday life.I'm Andrew Huberman, and I'm a professor\nof neurobiology and ophthalmologyat Stanford School of Medicine.Today marks the fourth episode in\nour four-episode series with Dr.Paul Conti about mental health.Today's episode deals with\nthe topic of self-care.We hear the phrase self-care a\nlot nowadays, but rarely, if ever,is self-care precisely defined.For instance, is self-care\nabout pampering oneself?Is it about self-acceptance?Is self-care about just making sure we\nget enough sleep and enough exerciseand have healthy relationships?Well, it turns out that yes,\nindeed, adequate self-careis about all of those things.But true self-care, the topic of\ntoday's episode, is about far moreas it relates to our mental health.True self-care is also about constructing\na life narrative in which we frameour past, our present and future in\na way that allows us to see what'sgone wrong, what's gone right, and\nthe best path to navigate forward.So in many ways, true self-care is really\nabout fostering a sense of self-awareness,and doing so within the context of\na framework that is known to work.And today, Dr.Paul Conti shares with us\nexactly how to do that.He also touches on some of the things\nthat, if not properly understood andprocessed, can inhibit our ability to take\nexcellent care of ourselves, includinghow to properly process traumatic\nexperiences, something that he is expertin, among many other topics as well.He also touches on some of the things\nthat can potentially serve as barriersto excellent self-care, including\ntraumatic experiences, and explains howto frame those traumatic experiences\nso that we can best move forward.He also shares with us various\npractices that include therapy, butalso practices that we can carry out\non our own, such as specific forms ofmeditation, journaling, and other ways of\nexamining the self and fostering betterself-care toward our mental health.As I mentioned before, this is the\nfourth episode in our four-episodeseries all about mental health.I realize that perhaps not everyone has\nhad the opportunity yet to listen to theprevious three episodes in this series.If you haven't, it certainly won't prevent\nyou from gleaning important informationand protocols from today's episode.But I do encourage you at some\npoint to try and listen to all fourepisodes in this series because at\nsome level they are interwoven at thelevel of concepts and of practices.I'd also like to highlight that Dr.Paul Conti has generously provided\nsome simple diagrams that can helpyou navigate today's material and\nthe material in the other episodes.They are available as zero-cost PDFs by\nsimply going to the show note captionswhere you can view them or download them.Before we begin, I'd like to emphasize\nthat this podcast is separate from my"

            "text": "Conti, welcome back.Paul Conti: Thank you.Pleasure to be here.Andrew Huberman: For this series, we've\nbeen focusing on mental health andreally defining what mental health is\nand a roadmap to achieve mental health.And in episode one, you laid out for us\na map, essentially, of the things thatany and all of us can look at pretty much\nat any time, with essentially any degreeof resources to try and get a better\nunderstanding of ourselves and how well ornot well we happen to be moving toward or\ncreating true mental health for ourselves.In addition to that, you spelled out for\nus what true mental health really is.And just to recap a little bit of that,\nit really boils down to these verb states,action states of agency and gratitude.Paul Conti: Yes.Andrew Huberman: And then in episode\ntwo, you covered some of the commonchallenges that you've observed in\nlife and in your clinical practice.And we address some of the ways that\npeople can overcome those challenges bygoing to the map, opening the so-called\ncupboards as we're referring to them,and asking specific sorts of questions.And then in episode three, we talked about\nhow looking at the map and exploring themap in those cupboards in particular can\nhelp people in relational aspects of life.Romantic relationship, work\nrelationships, family relationships,and the relationship to self.Paul Conti: Yes, very important.Andrew Huberman: Very important.Paul Conti: The foundation of all\nrelationships outside of ourselves.Andrew Huberman: And I'm so glad that\nyou highlighted the relationship toself, because today's episode, we\nwill, of course, return to the map.And I should mention that if\npeople have not seen episodesone, two, or three, that's okay.Today's discussion will be\nentirely accessible to them.But I do recommend that at some point,\nthey especially listen to episode one andhopefully episodes two and three as well.But today's discussion is really about\nthe aspects of ourselves that exist inall people and the action steps, the\npaths of inquiry that are availableto all people that can allow anyone\nand everyone to improve their mentalhealth, to move toward these ideals of\nagency and gratitude on a regular basis.And as you pointed out, it is a process.It's not that we arrive\nat agency and gratitude.And just to reiterate, agency\nand gratitude are verb states.They involve ways of being in the world.Paul Conti: They're active processes.Like life is an active process.There's not an endpoint\nwe're trying to reach.We're trying to live.Andrew Huberman: And in thinking\nabout today's discussion, it occurredto both of us, really, that today's\ndiscussion is really about self-care.Self-care as a concept, I think, for\nmany people, evokes notions of like,okay, you're going to take a vacation\nor you're going to kick your feet upor get a massage, things of that sort.And certainly it can involve\nthose sorts of things.But just as if we were having a discussion\nabout physical health and we weregoing to talk about ways to take care\nof the physical body to enhance healthspan and lifespan, today's discussion\nis really about how to take care ofthe internal landscape, the mind.Paul Conti: Right.Andrew Huberman: Which also\nqualifies very strongly as self-care.Paul Conti: Yes.Andrew Huberman: So if you would, could\nyou tell us how you think about self-care,regardless of whether or not you have\na patient who's dealing with severemental illness or somebody who's just\nhitting the same speed bumps of life overand over again or anything in between.What sorts of self-care practices\nand mindsets do you suggestpeople take on for themselves?And for that matter, how do\nyou think about self-care?Paul Conti: Well, I think we start with\nfactors that are really just baselinefactors that have to be in place in\norder to achieve good things upon them.So the basics of we have to be\neating well enough to feel okayand hopefully eating really well.We have to stay hydrated, we have to\nget sleep, we have to move the body.These are basics, but basics a lot\nof people are not attending to.Similarly, we have to be in\na situation that isn't makingfear and misery all the time.So an example of an abusive relationship.A person has to navigate out\nof that before they can reallystart taking care of themselves\nin the way that builds goodness.So we look for the basic factors\nthat we need to take care of in orderto then look at the factors that\nbecome particular to each of us.And what we're really looking\nfor is self-understanding.How much can we understand\nabout ourselves?Be knowledgeable about what's going\non inside of us, why it's going on.Also, and very importantly, being\naware that we don't know everythingthat goes on inside of us, and being\ncurious about that and looking at howwe're engaging with the world around us.Do we feel happy?Do we not feel happy?How do we define what happy means?How are we engaging with the world?Because, as you were saying, the\nagency and gratitude are verb states.So how are we living life?How are we engaging with the world?Do we feel like life is a sequence\nof things I have to do, forexample, or are we doing things we\nreally, really don't want to do?Do we have to do those things?How could life be different?We start looking at ourselves to assess\nhow we're engaging with ourselves, thepeople, the world around us, in a way that\nis either generative or not generative.If we're in that state of agency\nand gratitude, then we are goingto have periods of time where we\nfeel peaceful, we feel a sense ofcontentment, or we feel delighted.So is any of that in my life?If not, why?Can I start thinking about that?Sometimes the answer is quite clear, like,\noh, there's this thing I love, and I'mnot doing that, right, and I can't do it.And then you revisit, like, is\nit true that you can't do it?A lot of times it is not true.And if it is true, how does the\nperson come to terms with that,process that, perhaps grieve?So say, if it's a loss of a person,\nthat can keep people in terriblemisery over years and years.So there may be things we have to\nunderstand, we have to process so that wecan get ourselves to that place of knowing\nourselves pretty well and engaging in theworld in ways that we have a pretty good\nunderstanding of and that are adaptive.And then we look to say, okay,\nnow how do I make that better?Because now we're thinking\nabout preventive medicine.We want our bodies to be healthy because,\nof course, we want to be healthy today.But we also don't know what will\nhappen in the future Will therebe an injury or an illness?I mean, eventually we all have an injury\nor an illness in some way or another.So we're preparing for the\npredictable challenges thatwill come our way in the future.And we're well-served by doing this\nabout our mental health, too, right?There will be challenges that\ncome our way, there will be lossesand stressors and things that\nmake us feel bad or feel scared.These things will happen to us.So the healthier we are, the better today\nis, and the better we set ourselves up toeither make tomorrow even better today,\nor if tomorrow gives me a challengeI don't have today, I can meet that\nchallenge and get back to a better place.Andrew Huberman: So if I understand\ncorrectly, it sounds like one of thecornerstones of self-care for sake\nof mental health involves askingreally good questions about oneself.Paul Conti: Yes.Andrew Huberman: I don't think I've\never heard it defined that way before.Paul Conti: Yes.Andrew Huberman: It's in such stark\ncontrast to the other forms ofself-care, which I certainly subscribe\nto as well, like making sure one getsenough rest and avoids toxic people\nto the extent one can, et cetera,or toxic environments and so on.Paul Conti: Right."

            "text": "You mentioned ask questions of the self.But the logical next question to that\nis, well, what questions do I ask myself?Sometimes we know we have\nan idea, sometimes we don't.And this is where the construction\nof a life narrative, like,let me think about my life.Let me potentially talk about my\nlife with a trusted other person.Let me potentially write down\na narrative about my life.And we can learn so much from doing that.So the person who thinks back and\nstarts to tell a story of themselves,and let's say, just as an example, that\nstory is going pretty well, and theperson is feeling pretty good about\nthemselves, and then say somethinghappens and it starts to change.Or then this thing happened, and\nthen I started kind of spendingtime with different people, or I\nstarted dating different people,or I took a different kind of job.And it can engender the reflection\nof, like, oh, things really kind ofchanged then, because the emotion\nsystems within us don't careabout the clock or the calendar.The emotions, often of negative\nexperiences, can backmap into our lives.And someone who can tell you, I was\nmiserable ever since I was a childcan then write out a life narrative\nthat describes a very happy childhooduntil something happened or something\nchanged at a certain point, whichcould be something dramatic, or it\nmight be increasing pressures ofschool, or increasing social pressures,\nor how things changed at puberty.And if we have an understanding of\nthat, we may know the right questions.Like, for example, let's say\nafterwards the person findsthat they're drinking more.An example, but a common example,\ninstead of taking that for granted.Oh, that's what I do.Or, yeah, I can't cope any better, right?The negative things people\nwill say to themselves.The narrative can often\npoint out, I can cope better.I did cope better.I did feel differently about myself.So the life narrative can really\nhelp us establish the roadmap.And part of what the life\nnarrative does is it guides us tothe places to ask the questions.Andrew Huberman: If you would be so kind\nas to tell us a little bit more about"

            "text": "how one would do this on their own.So does this involve\njournaling things out?I confess I have a file on my computer\nthat has a bunch of other files thatstarts with age zero to five, and\nthen I have some notes in there.It's not an autobiography, far from it.It's just highlights of events\nthat I remember, six to tenand so on and places I lived.And I use it just to kind\nof orient myself in time.I actually don't know what the purpose\nand utility of it is, why I initiallystarted doing this, but it's an important\nfile to me, and when I return to it, Ioften remember additional key events.So it's constantly growing.I mean, these files are getting\nquite large, again, with no specificpurpose of writing this out at\nany point, but just to orient.Paul Conti: Right.You can't not learn about\nyourself from doing that.It exposes truths of self.It makes you ponder about things.It draws your attention to ways in\nwhich you've changed, whether youthink those ways are good or bad.It draws your attention to change.It draws your attention to\nthe impact of external events.And as you said, it grounds you.It provides a way of\nlocalizing oneself in time.Like, I am here now.Wait, how did I get here?And the thoughts and ideas of\nhow we got here very much help usbecause often we don't do that.We're sort of rushing headlong\nforward, because in many ways,our society is prompting us.We live in a very fast moving society and\nwe want information and gratification,and often we don't even want it very fast,\nbut it's coming at us very fast anyway.And to stop and reflect makes a very,\nvery big difference even to thinkat times beyond our generations.To the best of my knowledge, the vast\nmajority of people on one side of myfamily, everyone was a shepherd for every\ngeneration until, like, two ago, right?And thinking about that of,\nlike, that's interesting.It makes me, in many ways, grateful.So grateful for the opportunity I've had.But I also think, well, they\nlived in close-knit communitiesthen, and what was that like?And we begin to see ourselves in a broader\nway, both in our own history and thenprojecting forward, which sometimes is\nabout children and nurturing children.But it can certainly\nbe about other things.It can be about friendship.It can be about work.So we start to see ourselves in ways\nthat are interesting, that are throughthe lens of truth, and that speak\nto our place in the world around us.And I think this engenders\nboth agency and gratitude.If I'm aware of, like, what have I done?What have I accomplished?When haven't I accomplished things?How might that be different?And a sense of gratitude for being\nhere and having opportunity andeven be able to think about this.My guess is when you read through\nthose files, that at some points,you have sort of a sense of marvel,\nwhile, like, whoa, that's me.Right?Whether it's a good memory\nor it's a difficult memory.No, it's all part of you that\nleads you through to today.And you do have a better\nsense of self through that.Andrew Huberman: One of the feelings\nI most often come away from thoseexcursions into those files with is\none of gratitude, because so much ofwhat's in those files are recollections\nof others that I really appreciate.Some are still alive, some aren't.And what that's meant to me and how that\ncarries me forward, so that's what I do.I'm sure there are a near infinite\nnumber of ways that people coulddo this, but what are a few that\nyou've seen work really wellthat people can do on their own?Or perhaps with a clinician as well?In fact, that raises the question,\nshould people share this sort ofpractice and the contents of that\npractice with a trusted clinician?Paul Conti: I think sharing with another\nperson always should be a trusted other.And we can kind of take stock of that, of\npeople have an idea of who may be safe.Often people say, oh, there's no\none I could share something with.But really, that often comes through a\nlens of fear, of exposure, of self, ofrejection, of vulnerability, which often\nis warranted, but sometimes is not.Sometimes there really are.In fact, often there are safe people.So the act of doing something other\nthan just thinking about somethingbrings, as you well know, it brings\nparts of our brain online that thenare thinking in a different way.So, for example, they may bring\nerror correction mechanisms online.So if I'm thinking over and over again\nthat I've never been good enough to doanything, that can be just automatic\ninside of me, but if I start to writeor to talk or even to formulate words,\nto talk to myself or to put words in mymind as if I were talking now, we come\nat it in a different way, and we can sortof ferret out the truth within us, which\nmight be, it's not true that I've neverbeen able to do things or achieve things.And people often bring that\nonline by doing something otherthan the same thought process\nthat's gone often over and over.And it's nonproductive, and it brings\ndown mood, and it raises anxiety, andit also builds a sense of futility.I mean, I cannot tell you how\noften I've heard a person say,no good will come of this.Or like, okay, try, we'll\ntry, but I know I can't be up.I've been thinking about this for\nten years or 20 years, but whatthey've been doing is the same thing.They've been ruminating\non it for ten years.They start talking about it and people\nwill say, oh my goodness, I've achievedmore in two hours than I did in years.But that's because you're doing\nsomething different in the two hours.So I think that's very important,\nespecially because we can't say,okay, go look in your unconscious\nmind and see what you find there.So then we need ways of\naccessing the unconscious mind.And the communication, either with\nself, in writing with others, canbe very, very helpful in doing that.I am a firm believer\nthat knowledge is power.Many times I will feel like I have a\nsense of really having helped someone,and the other person may have that\nsense, and we can see the change.And all that I've done is\nimpart knowledge, right?We all know different things.So often it's the case that, hey, I happen\nto have learned things that are differentfrom what that other person learns.And then I'm communicating\nto them things that I havelearned, so they know them too.And then they feel tremendously better.Because if we put inside of ourselves\nthe tools of understanding ourunconscious minds, and sometimes\nour conscious minds too will workon them, we'll make use of them.If you talk to a person, for example,\nabout how trauma can impact us andhow we can shove it underneath the\nsurface and how it can spin offshame, then that person may take that\nknowledge away and come back withreal understanding and the fact that\nwe can do this on our own, right?We can do this through good resources.We can do this by taking information into\nourselves that can be very, very helpful.And it doesn't require, because the first\nplace to start are with things we cando that don't require professional help.And sometimes we may come at\nproblems that do tell us thatwe should get professional help.So if we're having thoughts of\nself-harm, thoughts of not wantingto be alive, thoughts of real\ndespair, thoughts of real...of hopelessness...that's telling us, okay,\nlet's get some help.There's a role and a place for\nprofessional help, but people come toprofessional help in other ways, too.Such as, for example, reflecting\non the self; real example \u2014 personthinking, it really became kind\nof different when things startedchanging, like, after college.And then I thought like, oh, I've kind\nof gotten to this place and I've got agood job and things really should get\nbetter, but they kind of haven't, right?And that was really a branch point.That person may have never\nreally thought about that.Or they may have thought about it 10,000\ntimes and then shoved it underneath.From consciousness to\nunconsciousness, because it's ascary, vulnerability-inducing thing.It seems scary.Like, how could it be that I achieved\nthings and didn't get healthier?Now we're afraid of that, right?And letting that come to the surface,\nbeing able to say, oh, that's true.I don't have to be afraid\nto shine light on that.Then a lot of times that alone, sometimes\na person will solve their own problems.They think about it.They come in, they have all the answers.They thank me.I did nothing but listen.But the listening part is important.It allowed them to come in and\nsay what they needed to say.And other times, then it can be that.But it's not always that.Other times it informs us about\nwhat to work on clinically.And it might not be\nsomething that's dire, right?It might just be like, I\nwant to understand this.I want to be happier.I want to be healthier.I want to work towards these good things.When people talk about that, they're\nalways, if you really distilldown, what are they talking about?A sense of peace, a sense of\ncontentment coming at the worldthrough agency and gratitude.And we can do that through\nself-inquiry, including through therapy.It doesn't have to just be for\nsituations where, oh, there'sa significant clinical problem.Andrew Huberman: Is it the case that\nwhen somebody

appropriate\nway to refer to it, is the unconscious.Right?Okay.So for those out there\nwho, like me, sometimes saysubconscious, it's unconscious.The unconscious can throw things up to\nthe surface that can be real insightscan give us not just panic attacks, which\nI think most people would like to shyaway from, but as you point out, there's\ninformation in the fact that the panicattack is occurring under conditions.Paul Conti: And if you stir up the\npot of the unconscious and you putsome new information in, it can do new\nthings, it can figure new things out.Which is why the process of\nself-reflection, for example, and oftenthe process of therapy is not always, and\nin fact, often is not a pleasant process.But then we take away from that\nhard work, renewed insights.So someone, this happens all the time.Who knows?They know that a certain trauma\nis inside of them and has beenaffecting them, whether it's for\ndays or weeks or years, they know it.They don't know what to do about it.They have a conflict about it, so they\nkeep trying to shove it under the surface.They finally accept, for whatever\nreason, to talk about it.What often happens then is, let's\nsay during three or four successiveweeks of hourly therapy, that\nperson is crying and that personis upset or that person is angry.I mean, it doesn't always happen this\nway, but it does a fair amount of thetime

they've just beenangry or they've just been ashamed.A classic example is a death.I mean, how many times do people think,\nwell, that can't be still affecting me.It was X number of years ago.But they've never actually\ngrieved because they carry inthem, oh, it was my fault, right.And how many times do we hear that I\nshould have said something differentbefore, I should have gone, we then\nbackmap something that makes us feel bad.And then from the guilt and shame\ncomes the inability to process grief.So if the person then deals with.Right, I feel so bad about this.In fact, I feel so ashamed of it\nand I feel like it's my fault.And so.Okay, well, let's talk about that.Right after my brother's death\nby suicide, I felt responsible.I was not involved in\nany way in mental health.I had a business career at the time.And I finally went and saw someone.I wasn't acculturated that getting\ntherapy was something one did.But I realized, hey, I'm not okay, right?So I didn't know how.I just knew the manifestation of\nit, which was misery and risk.And I could just tell, I know\nwhat it feels like to not feellike this and this is not okay.So then I call the insurance number.Eventually I go in and see a therapist.And I'm sure she was a very good\ntherapist, but she didn't in thesense need to be, in the sense\nthat sometimes we don't need to useall the things we know we can do,\njust something basic with someone.And that's all she did with me.I mean, she got me talking about it,\nand then I talked about how ashamedI was because it was my fault.And then really.And then she challenged me about\nthat and then in a nice way.But then it became clear that I was\nso utterly shocked by it, right?Far from it being\nforeseeable to me, right.That the problem that I was having now\nwas the shock of it and the sense ofshame and guilt that it raised in me and\nthen me shoving it under the surface,not knowing what to do with it, then\nit's making all sorts of misery in me,and I can't actually grieve, right?So at some point during those sessions,\nnow I'm sad and I'm crying, right?And I know what she was thinking, right?She's good.Okay.Thank goodness, this\nperson getting better.She probably felt a sense of\nrelief because she could see,hey, he's coming out of risk.He's able to feel sadness,\nhe's able to grieve.He's been doing this before.So it's that work.Wait, if we put into it that makes\na difference, just as with physicalhealth, I mean, if I want to be\nstronger, I want to be more robust,like I have to go to the gym and work,\nor I have to do something that's hardwork, and then I get the benefit of it.And the same is true whether we're\nreflecting on our life narrative and itbrings some difficult emotions to us,\nor whether we're talking with someoneor whether we're doing it in therapy.But that's how that process of inquiry\nleads us, to take some of the Gordianknots in us, so to speak, and to cut them\ninstead of trying to figure out, like, howam I going to feel okay about myself, even\nthough I'm responsible for my brother'sdeath, because I should have foreseen it.I mean, that doesn't work, right?You have to say, I see what that thing\nis, and that has to go away, right?And then therapy can lead us to\nthe point where, oh, it wasn't myfault, and oh my goodness, I'm sad.Andrew Huberman: I'd like to take\na brief break and acknowledge"

            "text": "carried through all these episodes.And by the way, if people are not\nfamiliar with the map, we willcover it in top contour in a little\nbit more depth in a moment here.But one of the key things, or cupboards,\nas we're referring to them, to lookin in order to exert self-care and\nimprove one's mental health, is thisnotion of self- awareness, of really\nunderstanding that there's an I, a me,and exploring what that's really about\nin the moment, but also historically,through narrative, et cetera.Also in this map is a cupboard\nthat relates to salience.What's most obvious, or what do\nwe default to both internally, interms of what sorts of thoughts we\ndefault to, and externally, what arewe focusing on in the outside world?And I think I, and perhaps many other\npeople out there, are wondering how toresolve any conflict between a practice\nthat is aimed at increasing self-awareness and perhaps even drawing to\nmind early traumas or challenges orrecent traumas or challenges and salience.In other words, if I were to take some\nmoments or even an hour once a week andsit there and really think about the\nsorts of things that I don't want tothink about that have been gnawing at me\nbelow the surface for a very long time,the stuff that I gained some proficiency\nat pushing down beneath the surface.I think one fear that I have, and\nso I have to assume other peoplehave it as well, is that if I were\nto bring that to mind, that it wouldovertake a lot of my waking hours.It's like I don't want to think\nabout this thing or those things.And so now what's salient\nis something negative.And when I'm focused on something\nnegative, then I'm not able to beas generative as I would, like,\nmove forward toward my life goals.Now I could even have the realization,\nthe cognitive understanding that,okay, but that's necessary, right?Like, this is like getting a wound\nfixed or dealing with a chronic injury.Like, sooner or later, you got\nto deal with it, otherwise you'renot going to be at your best.But that conflict between gaining more\nself- awareness and also the understandingthat what is most salient to us kind of\ndefines the quality of our daily life.That conflict or friction seems\nlike an important thing forus to drill into a little bit.Paul Conti: Absolutely.And I would say this.If you think there's something that you\ncan't bring up into consciousness becauseit's going to take over your mind, or\nas people often say, I'm going to curlup in a fetal position, I'm going to\ncry and never stop, that is exactly thething you must look at, because salience\npresents itself in a whole array of ways.So if there's something inside of you\nthat's strong enough that it's throwingitself up to the surface, like, hey,\nmaybe you want to think about me.So your unconscious mind, throwing it up\nto the surface, that is active in you.And often, although a lot of it\nhappens in the unconscious mind, ithappens also in the conscious mind.And if the person then stops and thinks,\nhow much might that thing that you arenot thinking about be impacting you,\nhow might it be salient in other ways?And sometimes a person will realize,\nlike, yeah, that's on my mind.People say, oh, that's\non my mind all the time.It's like kind of on the back\nburner, but always there.And he says, right on the back burner.That's like having a voice in the\nbackground telling you somethingvery negative or very distressing.And it's just one example where\noftentimes there's a realization thatthat thing is actually quite salient.Sometimes there isn't a\nrealization until later.Oh, the salience of that is, that's\nwhy I don't let myself get ahead.It can come out later because we don't\nknow how much of it is unconscious,how much of it is conscious.But under the right circumstances, if\nthings are safe, as we said, if there'snot something going on that presents\nrisk and warrants clinical care, ifthere's something inside of you, and\nyou think, I can't let that to thesurface, then what that is telling\nyou is I must let that to the surface.Now, again, we want to do it in judicious\nways and do it in ways that are safe.But that's the message.Andrew Huberman: I think it's especially\nimportant that you mentioned that ifsomething is gnawing at our conscious\nmind every once in a while, thenit absolutely has to be operating\nbelow the level of our conscious.Paul Conti: Awareness, maybe\nrunning amok all the time.Level of consciousness.Andrew Huberman: So if ever\nthere was a cause for exploringsomething like that, that's it.Because we can't be aware of the ways\nthat's damaging to us or limiting us.Again, somebody listening to\nthis could be doing quite well.I'm doing great.Why would I want to do any of this?Well, perhaps they could\nbe doing that much better.Paul Conti: Right, absolutely.Andrew Huberman: Self-awareness and\naddressing one's personal narrativeand a sense of I is what we called\ncovered one under the function of self."

            "text": "Now, for those that listen to\nepisodes one, two or three, they'llbe familiar with what I'm talking\nabout when I say a covered one.Function of self.But just for sake of getting everybody\non the same page as we move forwardhere, maybe we could just return to\nthe map of mental health for a moment.We've talked about agency and\ngratitude as verb states, andyou also described in previous\nepisodes this key, really essentialconcept of this generative drive.So if you could just take a few minutes\nfor us and really explain what agencyand gratitude are, how one goes about\nbuilding those up and expressing those,and what the generative drive is.And then we'll return to the ten cupboards\nof inquiry under the structure of selfand function of self, which really\nrepresent the pillars and all the stuffthat geysers up into these simple but\nextremely powerful concepts and ways ofbeing, which are agency and gratitude.Paul Conti: Yes.So I really liked when you brought the\nimage of a geyser to mind, because ifwe think about the structure of self,\nwhich is one pillar, and the functionof self, which is another pillar,\nunderneath those pillars there are theten cupboards we've been talking about.And they represent the areas of inquiry\nfor us because they're the aspects ofthe structure and function of self.So that's where the answers are.Andrew Huberman: Right.Paul Conti: The answers\nare in those pillars.The answers are in those ten cupboards.So if we're doing that, we're looking\nthere, we're honoring what we find there.We're becoming healthier than that geyser.I imagine it coming out the\nspace in between the pillars.And what it is lifting up is,\nfirst empowerment and humility.But empowerment and humility\nare qualities, certainly theway we're using them, they're\nqualities, they're potential.So I have empowerment as\nopposed to being disempowered.So I have humility instead of, for\nexample, a reactive grandiosity oreven a reactive self- oppression.So I have these qualities of empowerment\nand humility, and then they becomeenacted, they become expressed by us.And I imagine riding on the top\nis the agency and the gratitude.It's at the top of the\ngeyser, and it's moving.Andrew Huberman: Right.Paul Conti: They're verbs.We navigate life as life moves forward.I will often think, like\nbeing on, like, the luge.And you see in the Olympics where the\nprize is going down the twisting path, andit's like, that's us moving through life.And we all have different pathways, but\nthey can interconnect and they can cross.That's what's happening.Living is an active thing.So agency and gratitude are active things.Why?Because they're the ultimate expression\nof all underneath of it, of them.That's where it goes.If the pillars are in the right\nplace, the geyser can function.The empowerment and humility are with us.So we're engaging with ourselves,\nwith others, with the world, through alens of clarity and through a lens of\nknowing we can make the world a betterplace and knowing our role in it.That's very, very active.And then it brings to us the peace,\nthe contentment, the delight thatweaves in and out, as you described,\nthat you will feel the peace, thecontentment, the delight, when\nyou're doing the solo podcasts.But you're doing something\nvery, very active.It's not a passive endeavor during\nwhich you feel all those things.But that makes sense.Peace doesn't mean nothingness.Right?Now it can.Someone who's looking out\nthe window at the garden theyplanted can feel that, too.But there's life going\non in them also, right?They're contemplating the garden.They know that they made the garden.So these are all active processes, because\nlife is an active process, and then we endup in this place of looking inside of us.These drives within us are both\ndeterministic and determined.Andrew Huberman: Right.Paul Conti: So think about how\nactive a process that is, wherewe have a natural bias one way or\nanother because of our genetics.Just like someone has a natural aptitude\nto be taller and someone shorter orto be more or less athletic, we have\npotential within us when the geneticscome together, and that may determine\nsome sort of set of parameters.So maybe someone who doesn't\nhave the blessings of being soathletic, perhaps myself, right?I'm not going to be the\nworld's greatest athlete.But if I work hard, I could be a lot\nmore athletic and have been at times.And if I don't, I could\nbe a lot less athletic.So there are potentials within us that\nget sort of genetically determined, buthave a wide array of variants around them.And then our choices determine\nwhere we are in that variance.If I don't take care of myself,\nI will be on the very lowend of the athletic spectrum.If I do and I cultivate myself,\nI can be on a higher end for me.Andrew Huberman: Right.Paul Conti: But still, that's a\nlot better than the lower end.There's a very big difference.The same is true in our drives.The more we're taking care of ourselves,\nwe're reinforcing the primacy ofthe generative drive and then the\naggression, assertion, proactive.That drive in us is realized as\nbest we're going to realize it.Not everyone's is going to be\noff the chart, and that's okay.But that drive is in a place that lets\nthat person take care of themselves,have a job they enjoy and can do\nwell at, and make their home lifebetter, whatever it is that we can do.We're more assertive, we're more engaged,\nand then that's bringing us more pleasure.So the pleasure drive, again,\nit's not a hedonistic drive.It's drive for things we enjoy.Like we enjoy safety, we enjoy\nabsence of pain, but we also enjoyfriends and romance and sex and food.Like these are things that bring\nus gratification, and we canhave that in a healthy place too.So there's not too much, not too\nlittle of the aggression assertion.Proactive drive, not too much, not\ntoo little of the pleasure drive.And then we're in a place where we\ncan meet where those drives are at.So if the pleasure drive is in a\ncertain place in us, we can meet that.And maybe we foster it, moving a little\nhigher up because we're doing good thingsand we're taking care of ourselves.So if our romance is in a\nbetter place, then we can takemore pleasure in our romance.If our physical fitness is in a\nbetter place, we can enjoy that more.We can do more things.So we are helping those drives to\nbe in the optimal place to subservethe generative drive, which we are\ntrying to optimize and maximize.And that puts us in the best place to\nhave the things under those pillars,in those cupboards, in a good place.And then on top of that geyser is the\nempowerment and the humility, and thenthat gets enacted as agency and gratitude,\nand we have more of the goodness ofpeace and contentment and delight.And that reinforces the generative drive.So that's what's going on.And it has never failed me yet\nto read or listen to someonecommunicating happiness, either.What they think it is, how they found\nit, what they're striving for, whatthey think it philosophically is.It's all that, and it's not\nas simple as a word, right?Because it's complex.We're complex, but the beauty of it\nall is the complexity is within us, butit's not out of our reach to understand\nourselves better and help ourselves.And if we do that, as we move further\nup the hierarchy, it gets simpler.Approaching the world through\nagency and gratitude as verbs,it's pretty straightforward.That's why that's the best metric\nfor romantic compatibility, right?It's not, this person plays a musical\ninstrument and that person's amathematician, so they're not compatible.No more than one plays the trumpet,\none plays the clarinet, andwe assume they are compatible.Where are those drives at?Are people healthy in a healthy place?We can then take the best care of\nourselves, engage with others ina healthy way, understand who's a\nhealthy other to engage with, getourselves out of unhealthy situations.And then we're building health within\nourselves and around ourselves.And that's how, at the different\nlevels of emergence, things get better.So if I make myself healthier and\nyou make yourself healthier, wewill be healthier as a group of two.That's always how that is.And if we're healthier as a\ngroup of two, we can be healthieras parts of larger groups.If the groups aren't healthy, we're\npushing towards greater health.We're engendering health, and that's\nhow we see health grow until itcan be manifest, even on a cultural\nlevel, where we're taking better careof ourselves, we're less punitive,\nwe're less rushing forward as asociety and trampling the vulnerable.And we realize, oh, I\ncould be the vulnerable.I care about other people, even if\nI don't know them, because I canunderstand and empathize with what\nit feels like to be vulnerable.And furthermore, I could\nbe among the vulnerable.So we behave differently as a culture,\nand that's what we're searchingfor on an individual level, all\nthe way up to a cultural level.Andrew Huberman: I have several\nquestions, but first, I want to justhighlight what you said about relational\nstructure, relationships, and thefact that, as was explored in episode\nthree, and you made so clear, andit just makes so much sense, most of\nwhat people explore for when lookingfor a romantic partner or determining\nwhether or not their existing romanticrelationship could be better or not,\nis focused on the wrong things, right?These very kind of superficial\nnotions of what people enjoy andeven level of education, some of\nwhich can really matter, but that'snot the critical issue at hand.And that the maps that the two\nindividuals have and the extentto which they are expressing their\ngenerative drive and agency andgratitude is far, far more important.And so for those that haven't heard\nepisode three and are interestedin relationships, not just romantic\nrelationships, but relationships ofall kinds, work, families, relationship\nto self, friendship, I highly, highlyrecommend listening to that conversation\nbecause it's truly spectacular interms of its actionable takeaways.By actionable I mean actions, of\ncourse, behaviors and also modes ofthinking that can really serve people.I also just want to make one\nclarification that I believe thatwhen you said hierarchy, when you\nsaid move up the hierarchy, you werereferring to the hierarchy within the\nmap that's been laid out here, right?As opposed to...I don't want people to get mistakenly\ndistracted by the possibility thatwe're talking about some sort of,\nlike, external social hierarchy.So I just want to clarify that.And that's actually a perfect jumping\noff place for going into the mapwith a little bit more depth and\ndetail and exploring these cupboards"

note captions.You can do that at any point,\nbut what we're talking about is abunch of things down at the bottom\nunder these two pillars, structureof self and function of self.These cupboards that are extremely\nvaluable for any and all of us to look inand explore and ask specific questions,\nbecause it's what resides within thosecupboards that combine in a sort of recipe\nand then geyser up into whether or not andhow much empowerment, humility, agency,\ngratitude, peace, contentment, delight,and generative drive we are able to exert\nand experience for ourselves in life.So imagine in your minds, if you\nwill, and here I'm borrowing directlyfrom a picture model that Dr.Conti provided before the filming\nof this series, which is an icebergwhere below the surface of the\nwater resides a bunch of stuff.And then a little bit is above the water.And maybe you'll help us revisit\nthat model now for a few moments.But if you take nothing away at this\nmoment, please understand that there's alot of complex stuff going on underneath\nthe surface of the brain and mind.But a key feature of this map is that\nwhile it is very, very complex underneath,what emerges from that complexity\ngets simpler and simpler, especiallyas we move towards places of better\nhealth and more effectiveness in life.So if you would, could you describe\nthe map in a bit more detail,especially what's down there in these\npillars, the complex stuff and thestuff that we should be looking at.And then we'll touch on some of\nthose cupboards that we all haveand the sorts of questions that we\nshould all be asking in the contextof some common challenges, but also\nsome very common and very effectivepaths to doing and feeling better.Paul Conti: Yes, the unconscious\nmind is the place to start.That's the deepest level\nof the structure of self.So imagine sitting on top of a biological\nsupercomputer the size of a house.That's what's going on inside of us.The unconscious mind is that\nbiological supercomputer.And if we're interested in ourselves,\nwe become very, very curiousabout what is going on in it.And that's where, even though it's not\ndirectly accessible to us, it can beaccessible through other ways, such as\nwe talked about reflection or therapy.And of course, there are other ways\ntoo, but it is accessible to us, and wewant to know what is in it, because what\nis in it has such a strong effect onwhat's going on in our conscious mind.That's the person on top of the biological\nsupercomputer, the size of a house or theimage we've been using is the top of the\niceberg that's coming out of the water.So we can look at that either way.But what is in it has, of course,\na huge effect on the part thatwe're aware of, our conscious mind.And I think the best analogy here, and\nit's actually, I think, quite an analogythat parallels very well, is to an\nabscess in the field of physical medicine.So an abscess is an area\nof walled-off infection.So imagine that there's some infection,\nfor example, it's often in the abdomen,there's some infection, and that\ninfection could be really dangerous.If that infection spread, boy,\nit could go to the blood, theperson could die from that, right?So the body does a really good\njob of walling off that infection.And that's a good thing, right?Because if the infection weren't\nwalled off, it poses huge risk.But the walled-off infection does\nnot represent a condition of health.So someone who has an abscess\nin them and doesn't know it.This happens frequently in medicine,\nand we see people coming to emergencyrooms, and they have a low grade\nfever, and they've had a low gradefever for a while, and they just don't\nfeel good, and they have low energy,and they're not sleeping well, and\nthey find themselves sweating a lot.There are pervasive experiences going\non that are really detracting from life.Like not feeling great all the\ntime, even though the persondoesn't feel really sick.That's sometimes why it takes a while for\nthe person to come to medical attention.So what's going on is better\nthan not being walled off.But it is not synonymous with health.So what happens in physical medicine?Abscess is identified,\nand then someone goes in.The surgeon goes in and drains\nit, and then the person is better.Now, think about that process.Like surgery.Surgery is not a fun thing.Right?There's anesthesia, there's recovery.But surgery is great when\nit cures the problem.Andrew Huberman: Right.Paul Conti: So it's not that, oh, the\nphysician in the emergency room orthe family practice doc identifies\nthat there's an abscess, refer tothe surgeon, everything is great\nand happy, and they're better.No, they have to go have a surgery,\nand that's not an easy thing.Andrew Huberman: Right.Paul Conti: But if they go and\ndo that on the other side, theinfection actually is gone.So they do not have the\nsymptoms that it was constantlyspinning off inside of them.And they also don't have the risk that\nmaybe that infection gets out of theabscess and their life is then at risk.So the parallel is looking into the\nunconscious mind to what is inside ofus that may be acting like that abscess.Even though this is an\nanalogy, it is not theoretical.This happens all the time.And the abscess inside that person\nemotionally may be the bullying thatwent on right around the time of puberty.It may be that awful boss who is just so\nmean and took that good job away from me.Andrew Huberman: Right.Paul Conti: It might be that.It might be that assault that\nI don't want to think aboutthat's really still with me.It might be that death I\nstill feel guilty about.I don't know what it is.But if there's an abscess in\nthere, we want to understandit and then fix it, cure it.And that's what the\ntherapy process can do.And that's why at times,\ntherapy is unpleasant.The crying and the anger.That's the parallel of\ngoing through the surgery.Andrew Huberman: Right.Paul Conti: But on the other side, we've\ndissipated the energy inside of it.We've taken care of it.And that's why it is so important to\ngo into the unconscious mind if thereare things that are

            "text": "ways to access the unconscious?Earlier we were talking about journaling\nand spelling out one's life narrativein written or in spoken form, either\nalone or with a trusted other.Let's assume that somebody either can't\nafford or is just not at the placewhere they're willing to do therapy yet.But they fully adopt this abscess\nmodel, or this abscess analogy thatyou described, which I think is an\nexceptional one, because, a, youhave the 20-plus years of clinical\nexperience knowing this exists.But also, I think we all, at some level\nkind of understand that there's stuffhappening within us that we can't explain.And I, as a neuroscientist, can absolutely\nsay that most of the neural machinery inyour head and the parts of it that are\nin your body, we don't have access to it.We love to think that we do, but we don't.It's just clicking away under there.So let's say somebody wants to make some\nprogress, really improve their levelof mental health, obtain more agency\nand gratitude, improve all aspects oftheir life and their generative drive.What are some ways that they can\nstart to tap into the unconscious?And my guess is, if it's not in\ntherapy, it's going to be by lookingat in some of these other cupboards\nas you're describing them, right?Paul Conti: Yes.Develop and embrace\ncuriosity about yourself.And if you can go for that curiosity,\nbeing dispassionate in the sensethat you talk about these files\nyou have with memories and eventsfrom your past, that's so good,\nbecause you're exploring your life.So someone who wants to understand\nthemselves better, do that for yourself.Go look at pictures, talk to people\nyou knew at different stages of life,reflect upon how you behaved at different\nstages of life, what you felt inside.Anchor yourself to memories and\nthen extrapolate from there.Become curious about yourself,\nand if you can, be dispassionate.This idea that sometimes\ngets called an observing ego.Andrew Huberman: Right.Paul Conti: There are other\nwords to put to it, but it'snot ego in a negative sense.Here, it means the ability to\nstand outside of oneself and go.And to really think about oneself\nwithout the negative emotion, we'reoften able to either see the trauma,\nfor example, or see the change.Like, why did I go from feeling\nreally good about myself, and Ifelt like I could do anything?And then just a couple of\nyears later, man, look at me,I'm mopey in the pictures.And then, yeah, I was drinking more.I stopped taking care of myself.That's a pretty big change, right?So now we're calling attention.What's that change?And a lot of times, the person knew it.Like, oh, I got rejected.I had that terrible breakup.And they knew it was a\nterrible breakup, but they keepshoving it under the surface.Maybe they didn't know it\nwas a terrible breakup.Maybe they can't figure out what it is.That's okay, right?Even if they recognize, look, there was\na change, then that will put the lie towhat in this example is likely going on.So that person likely frames\nthemselves in a way that is verynegative and always was true.Right?I can never achieve anything.I never feel good.No one likes me.I can't find a partner.Whatever it is we say to ourselves,\nit's always been that way.Andrew Huberman: Right.Paul Conti: Because the negative emotion\nis so strong, and that part of our braindoesn't care about the clock and the\ncalendar, and then the person goes backand thinks, it was not always that way.Right?And it comes to this a lot in therapy.It doesn't have to be,\nas you said, in therapy.But, no, I was a go-getter.Andrew Huberman: Right.Paul Conti: I'm thinking of the person\nwho said that I was a go-getter, andI went out there and did things which\nput the lie to her, saying that she waslazy, incapable, all those things that\nwere not true, but she accepted as truth.So she needed, from that\nmathematical perspective, like, togo back and question the givens.From our perspective, we're saying,\ngo look in the unconscious mind.Go look in that part of the\npillar of the structure of self.Go look there.That's the deepest part, the most\ncomplicated part, but it doesn'tmean we can't understand it.And if we start to gain\nunderstanding, then we can thinkmore about the conscious mind.Like, wait a second,\nwhat am I thinking about?What do I think about that?Andrew Huberman: Right.Paul Conti: Have I really\nthought about this?Or is it just running\nover and over in my head?What would I like to do about it?Maybe I'd like to learn more.Maybe I want to go get a book that I think\ncould help me, listen to another podcastthat could help me, talk to a friend.Like, maybe I want to do those things.So now the flow between the\nunconscious mind and the consciousmind becomes much more robust.And that lets us look further to look at\nthe next level up, the defense mechanismsthat grow up out of the unconscious mind,\nand we can have some understanding ofthem even though they're unconscious.So the idea of wait, when something\nshifted in me, how did my way ofengaging with the world kind of change?I was perseverant.And I would take some of that\nenergy in me that wasn't so good.And remember, I could put it into\nexercising and taking care of myself.And then that sort of shifted and\nI became sarcastic and cynical,and I started avoiding those of my\nfriends who are really taking careof themselves and doing well, because\nthat made me feel worse about myself.That's a dialogue that is\nreflective of defense mechanisms.Now the person isn't going to\nnecessarily say, oh, I used a lot ofsublimation, which is good, and then\nI started using reaction formationand avoidance, just as an example.But they're going to understand that\nin words, that whatever words they putto it, they understand that there was\na change, they put words to that theycan understand that process of change.It's not opaque.They're shining light on it.And now they can gain a\nbetter understanding ofit and they can change it.Even that realization that I was much\nmore functional, things were different.I mean, that can be a treasure trove\nof very relevant, very importantand very positive information to\nbring to the current situation.Andrew Huberman: I think we often romance\nthe idea of the person who can justlive life forward, who doesn't look\nback, who just doesn't really exploretheir past, is just action oriented.Because after all, when we wake up\nin the morning, all we can controlis our actions going forward.We can't rescript the actions\nof past, ours or others.Paul Conti: That is such a\ngood point of what happens whenwe're just looking forward.We become like a sprinter who\ncomes out of the blocks too fast.So if you think about the beginning\nof a 100 meters dash, they're thebest sprinters in the world, say,\nand there they are in the blocks.And if they come out of those blocks\nin the right way, they will gainmomentum, they will keep their form,\nand they will run as fast as they can.But if they do not pay attention\nto what is behind them, the blocksthat are supporting their body.The whole bigger picture here of\nthe limitations within the body.They have to know what\nthose limitations are.They have to understand themselves.That's how they avoid coming out\nof the block so fast and thensprawling headlong onto the track.And we see that happen, too.So if we're just looking forward and\nthought and idea, that's how to livelife, we will be tripping forward, and\nultimately, we'll be like that sprinter.No matter how great a sprinter,\nif you come out of the blocks toofast, you're going to trip forward.Andrew Huberman: Yes, I know I said this\nin a different form a few minutes ago,but I think a lot of people are afraid\nof self- inquiry, because they justdon't want the thing that they discover\nwhich resides in their unconscious, theabscess, if you will, or the damaging\nthought or thing that happened, whichthey are aware of, but are pushing down,\nto take over their daily life in a waythat doesn't allow them to be at least\nas functional as they are in the moment.Paul Conti: If you go visit the\nperson who had the abscess curedby the surgeon, on postop day one,\nthat person will be less functional.They'll be in a hospital bed.They won't be able to\nget up out of the bed.They won't be able to exercise.They're not going to feel their best.That's okay.It is okay that we, at times, can become\nintermittently, say, less functional.In the sense that we're more upset,\nthat I'm spending more time crying.That's okay.Because that's part of the\nenergy, the effort, the choicethat gets us to a better place.Andrew Huberman: Ok so it's clear to me\nwhy exploring the unconscious mind can"

better in the world as aconsequence, is not a terrific use of\none's time, even if it, at the surfaceseems to take us off course a bit in\nthe moment or for even a few days.And I think it's also worth highlighting\nthat it's not the case that if wedo an exploration of the unconscious\nmind, or look in any of these covered,for that matter, that our entire day\nis going to be overtaken by it or allof our sleep is going to disappear.I mean, we're not talking about\na process in which everything isdevoted to exploring these cupboards.I mean, there are instances, of\ncourse, where someone hits a crisisand they simply can't function.But in that case, the thing\nthey absolutely need to do isto look in these cupboards.Paul Conti: Yes.Andrew Huberman: What are some ways that\nwe can explore this other cupboard underthe pillar of structure of self, which\nis the cupboard of the conscious mind.Paul Conti: So we can also approach\nthis through the curiosity of self.We do a lot of things automatically\nthat we can stop and think about.Like, why do I do that thing?And it's amazing what that can provide.So, for example, I'm working with\na person who has been going to workfor a long, long, long time, didn't\nneed to go to work a long time ago.And there's so many other things this\nperson wants to do with their life.They're curious about things, they want\nto spend more time with older peoplein their family, but they had to stop\nand think, why am I going to work?Now he's fortunate enough\nthat he doesn't have to.He also earned.He's hardworking, he's diligent, he's\nfortunate, but he hadn't thought about it.He's been going to work\nautomatically for a long time.And it was the thinking about it that made\nhim realize, I do that automatically now.Why?Because it's rooted in unconscious\nthings but that he's nowbringing to the conscious mind.Because I value hard work\nand I value diligence.But him stop working doesn't mean that\nhe's not innately hardworking or diligent.He showed that for years and years and\nyears, and he can show it in other ways.Like by he wants to be attentive\nto older people who need help.There's a lot he can do.But he had to go back and look.And then, of course, there's a reason\nwhy he didn't realize it, right?And even though it's not even a bad\nreason, but clearly there was anovervalue of hardworking diligent, and\nhe didn't realize, oh, I've done that.I've done enough that I've convinced\nmyself, I know I'm hardworking, I knowI'm diligent, so I don't have to sort\nof serve that internal master anymore.And I can step away.And now his whole life has changed.But how did the change come about?By asking what might one might think\nis such a simple question to make nosense, like why do I go to work each day?Why have I been going?He's off on the road to change.It's one aspect of how we can\nexplore the conscious mind.It often leads us back to the\nunconscious mind, but it'sawareness of our conscious choices.We can also then use tactics.So, for example, cognitive behavioral\ntactics like thought redirection.Like if I'm aware that, hey, there's\na thought that comes into my minda lot, and I start learning ways I\ncan redirect away from it instead ofthinking about it 100 times, right?And if I learn how to do that, there's\nless sort of negative emotion thatcomes from thinking about it and\nI can start to feel better, right?It's the basic premise of it.But these are techniques that can really\nhelp us and they involve understandingand guiding the conscious mind.Andrew Huberman: I'm smiling because\nI'm recalling an experience I had.I have a female friend who, very\nimpressive person, really has overcomea ton, is a recovered alcoholic for many\nyears and takes, at least by my read,great care of herself and the other people\naround her, and has a spectacular senseof humor and a bunch of other things.But it's probably five, six years ago that\nwe were in conversation about something,I don't recall what, and out of apparently\nnowhere she said, I hate being busy.And it just stopped me in my\ntracks because I'm somebodywho keeps very, very busy.My schedule is extremely full with\nthings that I really enjoy, somethings I don't enjoy or enjoy less.But fortunately, at this point in my\nlife, mostly things that I enjoy at thetime, I was very busy with many things,\nincluding many things I didn't enjoy.And her statement just halted me.And I realized maybe I\ndon't have to be busy.This whole notion of doing a bunch\nof things I don't want to do, sure,we have to make our way in the\nworld and make a living and takecare of ourselves and others, but\nI realized that there was a lot ofextra stuff that I was doing, right.Paul Conti: Because I think what she\nmeant and what you were reflecting on was,I hate being automatically busy, right\n? It's not good to be automatically busy.And then it makes you think about, wait,\nhow am I busy in ways that are good forme and how am I busy in ways that are not?Am I just taking up\ntime to avoid something?You start really thinking about it.Andrew Huberman: Yes.And the conversation stays with me to\nthis day, because up until then, I neverreally thought about the possibility\nthat some or a lot of the things I wasdoing were truly a waste of my time.Mostly because I could be putting that\nenergy into generative things, right?Generative tribes, things that would bring\nme agency, gratitude, peace, contentment,delight, these sorts of things.What I'm giving as an example, I\nrealize, is quite different thansitting down in a chair and asking\noneself questions about oneself andone's schedule and what one's doing.Paul Conti: Same endpoint?Andrew Huberman: Same endpoint.And I bring it up because I think\nit was the fact that it stoppedme in my tracks, but also the fact\nthat I can't seem to forget it.That means that it must have had\nsignificance, and I would say hashad significance, because I think\nmost people are familiar with seeingthese news articles that come out.You know, woman or man, 104, reflects\non what really mattered in life.And it's almost always the same things.It's like close relationships.No one on their deathbed says, I\nwish I spent more time at work.I might be one exception.I actually really enjoy my work.So whenever I see that one, I always\nthink, no, my life without my life's work,it would been a diminished life for me.I think there are others\nout there as well.But I think it's very hard for us to\nplace ourselves into the future of aperson on our deathbed, looking back,\nand then make really good decisions now.I think there are ways to do that, but\nit seems that it's far more powerful tojust think about what am I doing now?And come to some realizations about\nwhat is really of value now and whatis of less value or no value now,\nand then make adjustments now, asopposed to doing the deathbed exercise.Paul Conti: You have no other option\nif you're going to make change.I mean, think about what a complicated\nand ultimately meaningless exerciseit is to try and project ahead into a\nfuture when one is on one's deathbedand it's like, what is that like?We can't imagine that and\nwe don't know who's there.Whatever that situation may be for any of\nus, it's not going to be what we imagine.So then we just make something up and we\ntry and what, extrapolate our lives in away that gets us to this place where we're\non our deathbed and we're not unhappy.Okay?It just brings us right back to the\nfuture because it's actually simple.That is so complicated.What are things going to\nbe like on our deathbed?What will happen between now and then?All things, I don't know.So it's impossibly complicated.So then you take it back\nto the present, right?Like what is it I'm choosing?I am the I right now that is moving\nthrough time or is on the luge oflife or whatever we want to say.So what am I choosing right now?That's how we make our lives better.And we're aware, of course, I\nknow there's a future I want tolead towards a better future.I don't have a crystal ball.I can't envision what that's going to be.But I can do my best now to guide my\nlife as best I can, and that's goingto have to lead me to the best future.Whatever all the variables\nare that I don't know yet.Andrew Huberman: The next cupboard\nunder the pillar of structure"

            "text": "of self is defense mechanisms.I have several questions about defense\nmechanisms, but the first question is,can we be aware of our defense mechanisms?And is there value in that?And if so, which defense\nmechanisms are accessible to us?And I guess the third question\nwould be, how does one go aboutexploring defense mechanisms?Paul Conti: Well, it's sort of fantastical\nimagery that there's this iceberg, right?Part is underwater, part is above\nwater, and then from the part that'sunderwater come these sort of branches.So the way I imagine it is there are\nbranches of ice that can be clearand have light pass through them\nin a way that has high fidelity.Or they can be sort of twisted\nand unclear and they distort thelight that passes through them.Now they rise up from the unconscious\nmind, meaning defenses are unconscious,they're automatic, but they're not outside\nof our ability to go looking for them.They're in the unconscious mind.It's not that we can't understand\nthem, it's that they're elusive andthere has to be a process of inquiry.But we can learn about them just\nlike we can learn about otherthings in the unconscious mind.And here again, knowledge is power.So I'm not going to learn anything\nnew, or I'm unlikely to learn anythingnew about my defense mechanisms if\nI don't think about them, right?But if I start to think about\nthem, then I can start to learnthings and to draw conclusions.How am I behaving now\nas opposed to before?Do I notice that?How I'm coping?We'll often think coping, but coping\nis conscious, but we can access that.How am I coping?What am I doing and what does it mean?For example, someone who after\nsome difficult experience thenstarts avoiding, can be doing\nthat without an awareness of it.Avoidance is a defense so\navoidance of situations or peopleor potential negative emotion.So self- reflection can help us understand\nwhich defense mechanisms we're usingand what may have changed in us.So an example, and an example we see\nall the time is someone who, say,had as a primary defense mechanism,\nsublimation before some difficult event.And sublimation is taking energy,\ntaking, say, excess aggression,turning it into something positive.It's a good way of handling\ndistress within us.It's healthy, right?And now, after some change in\ntheir life, they find that, saythey're drinking more and they're\nrelying more and more on alcohol.And you might say, well,\nthey're soothing with alcohol.Yes, they're soothing with alcohol in\none sense, but what else might that mean?And oftentimes what you'll see is maybe\nthe person is using alcohol becausethey're mad at someone, they're punishing\nsomeone, that someone is probably them.They get to have the short- term\nsoothing, but then to feel worseabout themselves the next day, right?And the alcohol is in part a search\nfor soothing, but it's in part anacting out against the self, which\nis a different kind of defensemechanism that is not healthy.So the process of reflection or of\ninquiry can help us understand thebranches that are coming up from the\niceberg, from the unconscious mind.How are they in me?Are they arranged in a way that's sort of\nelegant and they're clear and the lightis passing through them, or are there\nthings that have become sort of twisted?Okay, what exactly is that?How do I go change that?I don't want that branch that is\nsort of opaque and that the lightcan't get through or is distorted.So I can go look at that.Because even though defense mechanisms\nare unconscious, if I'm working onmyself, I can take away that, so\nto speak, diseased branch, right?Or that branch that's not healthy and\nput in its place something healthier.That's how we can change\nour defensive structure.Those branches of our defense mechanisms.Because even though they're unconscious,\nwe can reflect on them, bring them toconsciousness, and then bring ourselves\nto bear to make ourselves healthier.And it can indeed get healthier.And as it gets healthier, it affects\nthe next level around it, which isthe person's character structure.So, remembering, we're using\nfantastical imagery, right?Because around the iceberg, below and\nabove the water, and the branches thatcome out of the part of the iceberg\nunder the water and how they arraythemselves, we're imagining that\nthere's a nest that's encompassingall of that, the unconscious mind, the\nconscious mind, the defense mechanisms.And that nest is the character structure.It's a way that we contain and define\nthe self that rides on top of everything.It is into that nest that the self\nsettles and from which the self grows.Because the character structure, it's\nmore than just the conscious mind.It's sort of the conscious mind in action,\nthe defense mechanisms in action, all thethings that are going on underneath the\nsurface in the unconscious mind in action.And then that's how we \"be,\" you\nthink be as an active word, right?That's how we are, or that's how\nwe actively be in the world, howwe're engaging with the world.Andrew Huberman: So you described the\ncharacter structure as the nest that"

            "text": "is up above the surface of the water,\nand that includes things like theseunconscious defenses and all other\naspects of what comes from below.Then you also said that the self,\nourselves reside in that nest.I don't recall the exact wording,\nbut you said something to the extentof the self grows within that nest.Paul Conti: Yes.Andrew Huberman: And as you said that,\nI immediately had the image in mindof a nest that is either incredibly\nnurturing and can really foster the selfin its best ways and can give rise to\nempowerment, humility, agency, gratitude,peace, contentment, delight, generative\ndrive, all these wonderful things.I also imagined a nest that isn't as\nclean as it could be or that has someholes in it, or that isn't stable in\nthe wind and these sorts of things.Is that sort of imagery\nthat's coming to mind for me?Is that a decent way\nto conceptualize this?Paul Conti: Yes, and I think\nit is a very important point.The self nests in the character\nstructure, and from nesting inthe character structure, it grows.We are the self that grows\nfrom within that nest.And that tells us a couple of things.One, I am something now, right now.The things I've done, the\nthings I've thought, the thingsthat have happened to me.Like there's a self now.So one might think then what grows\nout of the nest is what I am now.Hence the concept of acceptance of self.That's what I am now.But I am also responsible\nfor tending what is growing.I'm responsible for weeding it.I'm responsible for planting\nhealthy seeds in it.And I think that captures the truth\nof the acceptance of ourselves.This is what I am now.This is who I am now.But isn't it beautiful that\nI can tend and nurture it?And we know, as you'd commented,\nwhat happens if you don't tend it.There's a lot of weeds.Things aren't going well.Things start to get unstable.That's not good.And we can go that way too, right?That's where agency, gratitude, part\nof how it all cycles through, right?Because our unconscious mind is still\nworking like it's all still happening.And that's how we tend that\ngarden of the self, so to speak.That's how we best tend it, so that\nwhat grows up from it is a selfthat we recognize in the way that\nwe want to recognize ourselves.We see a self that we can feel proud of.We see a self that we understand\nwell enough to guide forward.We see a self for which we have\nenough respect and humilitywithin us to understand that\nwe don't understand everything.And it's from that self that\nwe engage with the world.Andrew Huberman: I've heard many times\nbefore, kind of in the circles ofpsychology and self-help and elsewhere,\nthat we need to all learn to mother andfather ourselves to some extent, and I'm\nnot a developmental psychologist, butmy understanding is that the unconscious\nmind, the conscious mind, our defensemechanisms, the character structure, all\nthe stuff that makes up the nest whichthe self resides and hopefully can grow,\nare at least at some stage of life,perhaps all stages of life, determined\nby genetics and by how we were raised.Nature and nurture.But this phrase, we have to learn\nto parent ourselves, is thrownaround a lot these days, certainly\non social media, but elsewhere too.And oftentimes that brings to mind sort\nof stereotypes of mothering and fathering.And these stereotypes break\ndown quite a bit these days.Things like we have to be\nnurturing to ourselves.Self-respect, self-love, self-protection.Right?Healthy self-protection\nand these kinds of things.And all of that sounds fine and good,\nbut it's always seemed rather vague tome if I'm telling myself I'm okay, or\nis that mothering and fathering myself?I don't know.It doesn't seem as concrete as\nperhaps I would like and otherswould like because it's not spelling\nout to specific actionables.What you're describing here makes so\nmuch more sense to me, even though someof these concepts are a bit abstract,\nbecause the idea of this nest in whichthe self resides and emerges from\ncharacter structure, one can immediatelysee why it's so valuable, and it's\nsuch a key component of mental healthand self-care to tend to that nest.And written into that is the fact\nthat the nest is malleable, thatwe really can make changes, right?That we can create a better\ninternal environment for ourselfby going through these cupboards.Paul Conti: You're pointing out another\ncrucial factor here, which is if I amthe garden of self that grows up from\nall of it, and I am responsible fortending the garden, I'm also responsible\nfor tending to the whole structure.And that's so important if I'm going\nto take care of myself in the ways thatwe've talked about, I'm going to tend\nnot just to the garden that's growingout that I can see on the surface,\nBut I'm going to attend to all ofme, to the entire structure of self.An example here that I think can\nillustrate it pretty well is, soimagine a person who's doing well.The part of the iceberg under\nthe water is solid, right?The consciousness on top is solid.The defense mechanisms are\nclear, the nest is good, thegarden of self is flourishing.And then there's a significant\ntrauma to that person.There's a car accident, someone is\nhurt, there's a death of someonearound them, they have a serious\nillness, they lose a job, right?It can even be they spent too much\ntime contemplating and looking atnews from murders around the world.And all the awful things that\nwe can spend too much time with.Something traumatic then goes\ninto the unconscious mind, right?The trauma happens, and what often\nhappens, not always, but what veryoften happens is the guilt and shame\nthat are raised cause us to pushthe trauma underneath the surface.Now, that's in the unconscious\nmind, and it's impacting it.And that stability is threatened, right?I mean, it's all riding on top of\nthis giant part of the iceberg that'sunderneath the surface of the water.And, okay, we don't have to worry too much\nabout it if things are going well, butif it starts to get fragmented, it starts\nto shift, it threatens everything thatrides on top of it, which is why taking\ncare of ourselves means taking care ofall elements of the structure of self.Andrew Huberman: That all makes very\nclear why tending to the garden is sokey, and why we as individuals are really\nthe people most fit to do this, right?Of course, when one can, that\nwork should be done with somebodywho's a really terrific clinician\nto help guide that process.And where one can't work with a\nclinician, one would hope that theywould take a structured approach to\nthis, which is really what we're talkingabout here and in the other episodes.Paul Conti: And keeping in mind.Keeping in mind that tending to\nthe self means tending to thewhole structure of self, right?If we keep that in\nmind, we won't go wrong.We'll pay attention to the surface,\nbut we'll pay attention to thethings that are under the surface.We pay attention to the\nwhole structure of self.We will shepherd ourselves\nforward as best we can.Andrew Huberman: I'd love for you to\ntell us about the function of self, the"

            "text": "the defense mechanisms in action.I find these infinitely fascinating,\nand I think many other people dotoo, because sublimation, denial,\nthese kinds of things, they reallyprovide so much of what does and\ndoesn't happen to each of us.If you could tell us how we can think\nabout our defense mechanisms in actionin a way that can improve our health.Paul Conti: Yeah, of course.Defense mechanisms are\nunder the structure of mind.Defense mechanisms in action\nare under function of mind.They're unconscious processes\nthat we can gain sometimes a verygood understanding of by directing\nour conscious mind towards them.And this is a place where we\ncan use narratives, we canuse an understanding of self.So as an example, someone who's\nthinking about themselves and whatthey want to do for a living, if they\nwant their job or where they want tolive, and who's thinking about self\ncan realize he's going to feel goodwhen I'm doing something for someone.When we hear this a lot, especially\npeople who then direct themselvestowards helping professions, like,\nwhat did I like about that job?It wasn't that it had a great salary.It wasn't that the hours were good.I like that it was really helpful\nto people, or there were people thatwere underneath of me in the hierarchy\nthat I could really kind of nurture.Right.And I think, right, and I love putting\nfood out for the birds and the squirrels.It can be a realization of self\nthat guides us towards consciouslyapprehending and thinking about\naltruism as a defense mechanism.Because altruism is a defense.It's a healthy defense where if you can\ndo something good, you do something good.Make something good.That's the endpoint of it.Like, you don't need that to\ntranslate into something else.It's a defense mechanism.It's a good one.And you can certainly see how it\nfits with the good things we'retrying to build on top of it.And sometimes through that process of\nreflection, the person becomes awareof that they haven't chosen jobs by the\nobvious things that even they thoughtthey chose jobs by \u2014 where is the job?What does it pay?It wasn't that.That what they really valued and what\nthey then started choosing upon mighthave been something that they weren't\naware of until they think about it.And that leads them to the\ndefense mechanism the same way.Another example could be\nrationalization, right?Someone who thinks about their\nlife and they think, you know, atleast kind of tell myself something\nis better than it is, right?And then ultimately I'm\ndisappointing myself.I tell myself, like, you're\ndoing really well at work and I'mnot really working hard enough.And then when I have that\nreview, I feel lousy.And that last person who broke\nup with me and said, you justweren't being a reliable partner,\nor that person was right, and thatcan lead to, oh, what's going on?I always think things are going\npretty well when they're not.That's guiding us towards\nrationalization as a defense mechanism.And again, a person doesn't have\nto say, ah, I conclude I am usingrationalization as a defense mechanism.But there can be words put to that\nof seeing a pattern in the self.When this is done as part of therapeutic\ninquiry, we're often looking to identifythe defense mechanisms, and that can be\ngreat too, but it's not always needed.Defense mechanisms result in patterns.So if a person just sees the pattern,\nthat can be enough to recognize thepattern and either, say, follow the\npattern of altruism as a defensemechanism, or how do we work against,\nhow do I work against the pattern ofrationalization as a defense mechanism?Andrew Huberman: Can we conclude\nthat patterns that we don't likeare the reflection of unhealthy\ndefense mechanisms, and that patternsthat we like are the consequence\nof healthy defense mechanisms?Paul Conti: Usually, yes.It's worth some thought and some\nreflection and putting together like,what exactly are the pieces of that?But basically the answer to that is yes.Andrew Huberman: In an earlier\nepisode, you mentioned one defensemechanism in action that is often\nobserved in people is acting out.This immediately sounds like\nan unhealthy defense mechanism.So to keep with this concept of the\npatterns are often more observable thanare the underlying defense mechanisms.Would it be the case, for instance,\nthat if somebody has a repeated setof failures, that's a pattern, or is\nrepeatedly in friction in a particularrelationship in their life, maybe\neven just with one person, likeall other relationships are going\ngreat, but then they're in a lot offriction with this one other person.So there's a pattern from that\npattern they could explore.What.Is it important that they get to a verbal\nidentification of the defense mechanism,or what sorts of steps would one take\ngoing from a recognition of the patternto understanding of the defense mechanism,\nperhaps in a way that moves them forward?Paul Conti: The understanding of the\ndefense mechanism can be very helpful,but isn't always needed, right.If you can recognize a maladaptive\npattern like, oh, this is happeninga lot and it's not good for me, you\nbecome able to change that pattern.So understanding the\ndefense can be helpful.I mean, again, the more\nunderstanding the better.But it's not always necessary here.I think to understand the\ndefense mechanism, we shouldfirst define acting out.Because we think of acting\nout, just hearing the words, assomething that's volitionally done.Right, but that's not\nwhat we're talking about.Defense mechanisms are unconscious, so\nthere's an automaticity to the responsethat the person can see by reflection.Because this isn't\nconscious choice to act out.That's something different.That's bad behavior.But what we're talking about here is the\nthing that's automatic and unconsciousuntil we bring it into our conscious mind.And acting out isn't\nalways dramatic either.Here's one example.So let's say in a relationship\nsituation, you have one person whoalways does the dishes, other person\ndoes something different, right?That person does the dishes.And it's onerous.People have busy lives.It's onerous.Have to do a lot of dishes.And every time things aren't\ngoing so well, there's a littlebit of conflict between them.The other person makes\ntwice as many dirty dishes.This is exactly the kind of thing that\nhappens in relationship situations wherethis little thing becomes a little crack\nin the door that opens more, and thenthere's a foot in the door, and now\nthere's a big problem because we act outin these ways that we're not aware of.So again, the person isn't\ndeciding, I'm going to do that.So that person has to do more work,\nbut there's an automaticity to it.And upon reflection, sometimes a person\ncould realize, I'm doing that, right?Or it's a real example person who\nrealizes, I just make much moredifficulties around the house, I\nmake a lot more difficulties for mypartner and was like, whoa, this person\ndoesn't want to be doing that, right?They love that person.They don't want to be doing that.But by realizing that when they can\nbring a process of change and justbeing more self- aware and saying,\nlook, I don't want to do that, I don'twant that to be a defense anymore.If I have conscious awareness\nnow, I can control it.And maybe that person is\ndoing that other places.Maybe the person says, you know, it\nkind of goes that way at work too.I could contribute to a project and\nmake something easier on a person.And I realize I don't do that.If I'm feeling in some negative\nway, then we can go find, okay,what might the roots of that be?For example, did a parent\nrole model that behavior?Was that done to them where the\nparent was really good to them?If they were behaving in the right way\nand they make their breakfast, right?And if not, well, you make it yourself,\nor, oh, sorry, there's no milk.These things happen.And then the person gets in them.Some array of circumstances, feelings,\nresponses, all the stuff that goeson in the unconscious mind that then\nthrows up to the surface this kindof acting out as a defense mechanism.So I think it's important to\npoint out, and it's a goodexample because it is unconscious.And a lot of times how we're\ndoing it is not dramatic.Andrew Huberman: What about salience,\nthis cupboard under the function"

            "text": "of self that I think we are all too\nfamiliar with, what we pay attentionto internally and externally?I have a sort of bizarre meditative\npractice that I've talkedabout before on the podcast.I don't know why I came up with this,\nbut it's more of a perceptual exercisethat I do from time to time, where if I\nfeel like I'm too in my head, I literallyfocus my visual attention outward.I try and place on a horizon\nor some object out there.And other times, if I'm sort of in\nthe world too much and I want to getback into myself, I'll close my eyes\nand do a moment or two or more of moretraditional, what traditional means,\nwhat people think of as meditation.The practice involves setting aside\na minute or two and deliberatelystepping through closed eye meditation.It's not really meditation again, it's\njust recognize I'm a self, like here,contained within the skin of my body.Then I open my eyes, I look at my hand.This all sounds very\nsilly as I describe it.And then I think about a bridge.Like my perception can be split between my\nawareness of self internally and my hand.Then I look out some distance, 10,\n12 feet or so, and do the same.I sort of bridge self- awareness\nwith external awareness, andI step out to the horizon.And then I sometimes like\nto do the exercise of...It goes with a popular meme, we're\njust like this pale blue dot, I thinkabout myself right here, but then the\nfact that I'm on a planet that's likespinning in space and then right back\ninto myself, and then I go about my day.And I developed that a few years\nago more on the basis of what Iknow about visual perception and\ninteroception, our recognition ofinside, versus exteroception, just\nfancy language for recognitionand perception of what's outside.But that's my practice of orienting\nmyself in life, because then I feellike I have better buffers against\nwhat happens around me and howmuch I'm reacting or not reacting.That's my practice.I have a feeling it touches into a few\nof these bins, but it certainly doesn'tget at approaching a specific problem or\nthinking about where problems might existbeneath the surface that I'm not aware of.Paul Conti: Because it's only\none part of the equation.It's paying attention to salience,\nwhat you're doing then, youare grounding yourself in order\nto change salience, right?And that is a strategy.You said, oh, maybe it's\nsilly or this or that.No, it's an understood and known strategy.For example, variations of that are\nwhat people can do to prevent panicattacks, to change the salience.If the salience is I'm going inside\nof me and I'm feeling panicked and Ijust have a feeling of awfulness, you\ncan change that salience by groundingyourself to the world around you.We tell people, place your hands\non the table, look at the specificsof exactly what time it is.Look at the shape of a doorknob.Ground yourself so that\nyou can change salience.Because now, as we move up the\nhierarchy of function of self, we'regetting to using the conscious mind.Things that are salient to us can be\nexternal, they can be internal, and ifthey're internal, they can be conscious,\nand sometimes they're unconscious.So it's not all about the conscious mind,\nbut we're bringing the conscious mindto bear here to think about salience,\nwhich combined with everything else, canhelp us see what's under the surface.Most of the time, what we're doing\nis that act of self- observation.What is going on inside of me?Which can be, what am I thinking?This is how the person can\nrealize over and over, oh mygoodness, I'm saying to myself, X.And for the first time they say out\nloud and realize the thing they'vesaid to themselves 10,000 times.Or it can be a feeling state.Wow, what's salient to me is a feeling\nstate, say, of vulnerability, andthen everything seems threatening.So salience, it's a form of self-\nawareness that we could say is using theconscious mind now to tend to that garden\nof self, to look at that garden of selfand say, what's really growing from it.Is it all things I like?It's going to be never all things\nwe like because it's a process.But am I happy with it?Am I not happy with it?Are there weeds that are\ncoming up all over the place?That could be the intrusive thoughts.So we're using metaphors, but\nit's actually very, very concrete.The salience part is what\nis going on inside of me?And that's a very interesting\ninquiry and informative.Right.It's interesting because it's informative.Andrew Huberman: Do you think that's\nan inquiry that's best done inmeditative-like states or setting\naside some deliberate time to thinkabout what am I thinking about?What am I paying attention to?How am I allocating my thoughts\nor my thoughts being allocated?I guess we have to respect the\nunconscious component here.We don't just walk around saying,\nI'm placed my attentional spotlightthere and then my thinking here.Paul Conti: We always want to be\naware of what we, there are things wedon't know that's respectful, that's\nappropriate humility, because it's true.Andrew Huberman: So I'm assuming\nthis ratchets directly into the"

explore,like, how am I spending my time again?Not as an efficiency exercise, but\nas a way to start to explore the selfand the mind for sake of building\nup to more agency and gratitude.Paul Conti: The routes to most\neffective self- inquiry, tobringing the conscious mind to bear,\nreally differ widely by person.There are some people who, they\nare so well served by doingthat when they're meditating.There are other people who they can really\nget at that when they're playing a sport.It's going on inside of them along with\nthe other things that they're doing.Some people find it in the shower,\nor they find it when they wake upin the morning, or they find it when\nthey're with an animal they love.Or they might find it when they're\nreading a certain kind of material.And then they read it, and then\nthe reading trails off and they'rethinking, they're a reverie, sort\nof inside so how we can engenderthe best use of our conscious\nminds is going to differ by person.But again, we can think about that,\nlike, what really works for me.Let me do more of that.It's interesting.We see people sometimes, I see people a\nlot of the time who are, they're tryingto meditate to understand themselves.And it's like not working right.And it's like I must know how to\nmeditate in order to understand myself.Well, it's not necessarily true.It might be I must go on more hikes\nin order to better understand myselfbecause that's how it works for me.So that process of reflection can be\nvery, very helpful to us because we'reusing our conscious mind to try and\neither look inward, what is salientit to me, including understanding\nthat I don't understand everything,but I can understand a lot of it.And outward, what\nbehaviors am I engaging in?What are my behavior patterns?And to be reflective about that, to think\nabout that can be immensely helpful to us.Like, how am I spending\nthose hours of the day?What am I doing with my time?Am I wasting my time?Do I always get mad and say\nsomething mean to somebody?Why?Because I had a negative\nthought about something.Am I doing that?Have I kind of changed since something\nunpleasant happened and now I'm not sonice to someone in the household, right.Or am I taking a lot better care\nof myself since I started doing X?Whatever X may be,\nlearning more about myself?Right.Doing more of the things I like...got...left that old job.It was so hard for me to leave.I do actually get myself to the gym.So it's a reflection upon self, because\na lot of what we do, we do automatically.And that's very important.The example that often is\ngiven is, okay, think about howyou last brushed your teeth.And the answer by like a blank.Because you brush your teeth\nin an automatic way, right.Most of us don't remember that\nbecause we just skip right over it.So it makes sense.It lets us think while we're doing things.It lets a lot happen automatically\nin the physical world, right.Just as it happens inside\nof us automatically.But we can, there have sort of\ntoo much of a good thing where toomuch is happening automatically\nand we want to stop and think.And it's remarkable how sometimes\nwhen people stop and think, theymight say, real example is, I don't\nwant to be spending five nights aweek at the bar and I'm spending\nfive nights a week at the bar.Why?Because I go home a certain way from\nwork, and there's a bar along that way.And then I think, oh, I'll just\nstop in and maybe see a friend.And then I know that once I get in\nthere, I'm going to have a drink.And I know once I have a drink, I'm going\nto get three, and I'm going to have three.And I see this pattern of behaviors\nand how, like, I don't decide I'mgoing to go to that bar instead of\ngoing home to see my wife or my husbandor my kids or whatever it may be,\nand I don't want to behave that way.Because there, it's a great example of\nhow you can stop that from happening.But once it starts happening,\nthe dominoes start falling.It's very, very hard.People don't generally realize, oh, my\ngoodness, I'm in the bar and I've had onedrink, and now I'm going to have two more.That's not the time.But the understanding, the reflection\nupon behavior patterns can lead aperson to stop those behaviors, to\nunderstand and recognize them, gettheir arms around them, shine the\nlight of day on them, and then havegreater agency and greater gratitude.I'm grateful I can go home to\nmy family, and that's what Ichoose to do, and I can do that.I do not have to end up at that bar,\nand I'm not going to end up at that bar.I'm going to drive a different way home.And if I can't get myself to do that,\nI'm have a friend in the car with me.And if I can't do that,\nI'll be in the backseat.But I'm not doing that\nthing I choose not to do.And it's a more dramatic example and not\nan uncommon one, but we can apply that thewhole way up the list, from nuances of our\nbehaviors down to more dramatic behaviors.Andrew Huberman: I've heard you describe\nthe unconscious mind and some of itsother interconnected workings with the\nanalogy of a phantom in the driver's seat.And we're in the backseat, of\ncourse, all within one person, right.This idea that we're just being taken\nplaces that we don't want to go orthat we know we shouldn't go or that we\ncan't really figure out why we're goingthere, and we have some idea, but we're\njust not certain about what's going on.It's not necessarily related to\nreally destructive action either.I mean, it can be, but what you're\ndescribing sounds to me a lot likeclimbing out of the back seat and maybe\nsitting in the passenger seat and lookinginto the driver's seat and going, oh,\nthere's something else going on here.Of course, all of this is one mind.And in doing that, taking\nsome control of the vehicle.Paul Conti: It's about\nunderstanding what is that phantom?Where did it come from?That's how we get rid of it.How do we get back in the driver's seat?We don't grab the phantom and throw it\nout the door or throw it in the backseat.It's ephemeral.We can't grab it.So how does it go away?It goes away through understanding.So very common example that the phantom\nin the driver's seat is trauma that wehave pushed in an unconscious place.And now that whole under the\nsurface structure of the iceberg isfragmented, and it's sort of roiling,\nand there's a big problem there.And if we go at that problem\nand whatever, it's spinningoff, right, that's the abscess.But it's a bad one.And it's spinning off a lot of problems.And that's why the phantom is in the\ndriver's seat, because healthy thingsare not built on top of that fracturing\nand roiling part of the iceberg.We see that a lot.The phantom could also\nbe something different.It could be one defense mechanism\nthat's unhealthy that we are reallyover-relying on, and then we can\nunderstand it through that lens.So there are just a few examples.But if we sort of wake up in the\nbackseat of the car, so to speak, andthe phantom is driving recklessly,\nthen how we get the phantom out ofthe front seat is by understanding it.And I always imagine, poof, it goes away.Because now it's not\ndriving my life anymore.I'm driving my life.It's gone.Andrew Huberman: The message that I'm\nhearing over and over again in my head"

more positive control.Paul Conti: Yes.That's why ultimately, what we're\ntalking about is optimistic.We can't help ourselves\nif we don't honor truth.And the truth is that there\nare complex aspects of this.So, okay, we want to go look\nat that, and we want to lookat how things can go wrong, and\nthat's all very, very important.But that's all wrapped in the best\ntruth, which is that we can change it.We can make it better.That's why the self, the garden of self,\nis on top of the structure of self.And the top of the function\nof self are our strivings.That's what comes next after behaviors.It's like, what are my behaviors doing?What am I doing?What am I striving towards?What am I doing, literally?Am I going to a job I hate?Am I doing things I don't want to do?Am I accepting treatment\nthat I don't want to accept?Am I treating people in\nways I don't want to accept?How can I strive for better?And striving and hopefulness\nare so intertwined.So the pinnacle of the\nfunction pillar is striving.The pinnacle of the\nstructure pillar is self.And we can see how the\nself, the strivings.What we're doing now is\ncombining the pillars.It's where it comes together.And your imagery of...That's where the geyser comes from.And we want that geyser to be healthy.It's a stream of clear, clean\nwater that's coming out of it.That's where our empowerment is.But empowerment is a condition of being.I am empowered.Empowerment rests within me.That's where humility\ncomes into the picture.Humility also something within me.I have humility.They're not verbs, but empowerment\nand humility then gain theirexpression at the top of that geyser.When agency and gratitude, those verbs,\narise from empowerment and humility.Andrew Huberman: What you've drawn\nfor us is an incredibly compellingpicture, because the picture\nor the map is really a roadmap.It's a path to ideals.And you've been talking about these\nideals of agency and gratitude across thisseries, and they just encompass so much.And as you mentioned before, they are\ninterconnected and they are verb states.And a critical component of the\ngeysering up from the pillars towardagency and gratitude are these two\ncomponents of empowerment and humility.Tell us a little bit more about\nempowerment and humility and howwe should view empowerment and\nhumility in the context of self-care.Paul Conti: Well, empowerment is a state\nthat we can create for ourselves ifwe're taking care of the pillars, right?So we're looking in the cupboards.We're doing the things that make\nour map clearer and clearer.This idea that, oh, that seemed like\na good path, but it gets clearer,and there's a swamp there, right?Or that didn't seem like a good\npath because it's circuitous.Oh, no.But there are good things along that path.So the map gets clearer as we\ntend to the cupboards in thepillars, and that empowers us.We're in a state.There's a state inside of us that\nis a state of potentials thatare now skewed in a good way.That's what empowerment is.It's not something that happens.It's a state that we then\nbring to bear on what happens.The same is true of humility.Humility does not mean not acknowledging\nthings that are good about you.And we often can very much\nmischaracterize humility.Like, is that person being weak?Is it false humility?Or people often who are\nconscientious don't want toacknowledge good things about them?Oh, no, I'm not that smart.That's not humility.Humility is consistent with truth.So if you keep saying you're not\nthat smart, but the world around youtells you that you're that smart.Then acknowledge that you're that smart.That's coming through the lens of truth.And we can go down to the pillars and\nthe cupboards and say, okay, how does aperson get to acknowledging that truth?So it's only by squaring away\nthe things that humility isn't.It is not denigrating ourselves.And we see that in a lot of people.I'm humble.And then that person often tells\nyou why they're accepting somethingthat's not good to accept.So humility is about acknowledging\ntruthfully the characteristics thatyou have within yourself, good and bad.And here is where we can identify\nthings that we're not so happy with.We have to have humility within us\nin order to make ourselves better.Just like I have to say, look, I'd\nlike to be more fit if I'm going tothen get myself in a more fit state.So saying, look, I can be a little bit\nsnippy with people if I'm irritated, orI can be a little bit condescending, or\nI can be a little selfish at times, it'shard to admit these things to ourselves.But if we have the humility to\nacknowledge those things, thenwe also get to have that broader\nhumility about just being a person.Like, wow, look how complicated\nthis is to navigate life.I mean, these pillars are not simple.And when we go down to the\nreal base elements of them,it can get very complicated.So then we have a compassion\nfor self and for others.Sometimes I'll say to a person, I should\nbe doing this, I should be doing that.They think they should be\ndoing something perfectly.And I will say to them, it's amazing\nthat we're moving forward, right?I mean, let's start with, wow,\nit's not easy to be human.It's not easy to navigate this world.And that kind of humility can\nthen allow us to feel good aboutwhat we build on top of it.It's not easy to navigate this world.And humans are pretty\nvulnerable, by and large.But I'm applying myself.And I'm proud that I'm applying myself\nor that I'm perseverant, but also I'dlike to be a little more compassionate.It's that sort of thing that\ncombines with empowerment.So empowerment and humility are\nthese potential states that thenexpress themselves or become\nenacted, however we wish to put that.But they change into the active\nverbs of agency and gratitude.And agency and gratitude\nare ways of being.They're verbs.They're active.So that's the point of it.From the sense of how we are living.How we are being.That's why agency and gratitude\nis in some sense its own endpoint.But because there's a circular\naspect of this, our activebeing is not the endpoint.If we're being in a healthy way,\nthen we get to experience things.Peace, contentment, delight.We experience them because we are healthy.So we get to be through the\nlens of agency and gratitude.We get to experience peace,\ncontentment and delight.And that makes a healthier us.The drives and their expression\nare in better balance.The generative drive is\nfostered and strengthened.And the drives underneath of it, the\naggression, assertion, proactive.We're really using that in a good way.And we're mining all of it within us.Like, I want to bring that to bear,\nand I can bring more of it to bear.That's very, very good.And the pleasure drive is active in us.I'm enjoying the things I do.I feel good about the things I do.I'm making good choices.And that state of health, what it\npromotes, the pillars, the cupboards, tostay clean and clear and healthy, right?But life is life.And the slings and arrows of outrageous\nfortune, the slings and arrows oflife will continue to come at us\nand cause us to go back and lookat the pillars and the cupboards.And even if they don't come at us,\nthose things are never perfect, right?But that's not bad, because by tending\nto them, where do we bring ourselves?We bring ourselves back to the\nactive verbs of agency and gratitude,the active verbs of living.And here we are.In this cycle that if we pay attention\nto it, we use it to understandourselves, we use it to improve\nourselves, can bring us to better lives.Andrew Huberman: How do you think about\na person, and I confess I've been this"

            "text": "person, perhaps still am to some extent,\nwho can really have a sense of agency andgratitude in certain domains, maybe even\nmany domains of life, and yet feels as ifthere are certain areas of life that are\njust so much more challenging than others.This stark contrast, like this\nstuff works, can do that, butthis stuff is just really hard.And maybe that continues long enough\nthat it almost starts to feel like, orthe person wonders whether or not maybe\nthat part of life is inaccessible to me.It's just never going\nto be successful for me.How do you think about these carve outs of\nfunctionality and lack of functionality?That's probably not the right language,\nbut I think this is important becauseit relates directly, I believe, to kind\nof narratives that we tell ourselves.I mean, they are narratives, right?I think it's important to think about\nthese because they are intermeshed withand perhaps even the consequence of\nnarratives that we have, like storiesabout ourselves that we have internally.And again, I'll be the first to admit that\nI've felt this way for much of my life.Certain things I can do,\nother things far, far harder.And sometimes it felt outside\nthe reach of possibility.Paul Conti: I have a very\nconcise answer to this one.In fact, it's nine words.Don't make yourself special\nin ways that hurt you.And we tend to do that as humans.Oh, I get to have A, B and\nC, but I don't get to have D.I get to have professional success.And I'm in pretty good shape and\nI have a lot of friends, but Idon't get to have a relationship.I mean, over and over and over,\nbecause the relationship part isso emotionally laden, it's the\npart that gets carved out, right?Falsely carved out the most.But it can happen in any arena\nof life where we make ourselvesspecial in a way that really is\nblack magic or is being cursed.You have the machinery, the ability,\nthe function to go about pursuing thethings you want and get them right.That sounds like a pretty good\nparadigm, except about somethingreally important to you.That can't be.We're applying the same machinery\nof self because we're talking aboutthings people want in a broad scale.Like, I would like professional success.I would like personal success.I would like to do well in my family\nunit and be a good family member.I would like romance.So we're talking about areas of self.And we will make ourselves special by\ncarving out one and then applying blackmagic or some cursed state that then\ntakes that away from us and that createstremendous consternation that will throw\nall of those cupboards in those pyramidsoff balance because we don't like that.That seems mysterious and ominous.What is there that you don't\nknow that's about being cursedso you can't have something.And then that makes anger and\nfrustration in us and more likely thatwe'll act out or we'll be frustrated\nand we start enjoying things less.Sometimes a person can wall something\noff like that and they can goforward with the rest of life.I mean, it affects them,\nbut it's not obvious.It's not on their mind all the time.Which is why the process of self-\ninquiry can reveal importantthings like, oh, I pretend that I\ndon't even care about professionalsuccess, and why do I do that?It's the only thing I'm not\ndoing very well because Ithink it's impossible for me.It's not something I get.Why?Because I got other things.So I don't get that.Okay, now we're really curious about that.And sometimes it causes very, very big\nproblems where a person can build anexternal sense of self that soothes\nsome of their vulnerability so theycan present in a certain way, but\nunderneath of that, they're hiding thesadness or the pain of what is missing.But that is then sort\nof eating away at them.And their feelings of self on\nthe inside don't match whatpeople see on the outside.We see a lot of this.And the process of self- inquiry, of\nself- exploration, of curiosity aboutself can lead us to realize what we've\ncarved out if we don't already realize it.Or it can help us to see that\nthe carve out makes no sense.It's as if you said, well, there\nare nine roads around my home andthey're all just regular old roads.I can drive on eight of\nthem, but not the ninth.You said, well, it doesn't make\nany sense if they're similar.It requires the same set of skills, right?If you know how to drive the car and\nhave the visual acuity, why wouldn'tyou be able to drive down the ninth?But even though that's a very mundane\nexample, but it's that, that we applyto very important and emotionally\ncharged aspects of our life.I get to have physical fitness\nand friends and career success,but I don't get to have love.I mean, we hear people say this.And that's a very powerful way\nof taking us away from whatwe want to achieve in life.It takes us away from the active\nagency and gratitude and allthe good that comes of that.Andrew Huberman: What you just said\nmakes a lot of sense, especiallythe point that if we have nine roads\naround us and we can drive downeight of them, why not the ninth?Because it places us back into the\nverb tense and the action tenseof the car like we're a vehicle.The I that we can take through the world.Sure, conditions matter.Maybe road number nine has boulders\non it, but it can't be that roadsone through eight were all just\nsmooth superhighways either, right?Those had challenges and we \u2014 I'm\nnot going to use myself as example.I, for whoever is doing this sort of\nexercise, had a mind that was able towork around those boulders, right, of\nchallenging people, of limited finances.These are all things I've experienced.And of course, people come into the world\nwith different levels of challenge andprivilege and accessibility, et cetera.We don't want to deny all of that.But those other eight roads are rarely,\nif ever, perfectly smooth roads.Paul Conti: That's why it's\ncompletely about the self, right?And it's the realization that if I\nbrought myself to bear and I got downthe first eight, I can bring myself\nto bear and get down the ninth.And as you're pointing out, it's not\nlike the first eight were easy, right?Maybe one of them was\nreally pretty smooth, right?But there's going to be a couple\nof them in there that have raisedreally strong difficulties, things\nto surmount and to overcome.And it's from that place of understanding\nthat we find within ourselves the courage,the strength to go down the ninth road.Even if we see greater\nbarriers, even if we're okay.I'm aware now, but I'm also aware that\nI avoided that ninth road for a reason.The boulders and the potholes,\nthey're more severe on that road.In fact, I'm kind of worried\nthat it's impassable.But it can't be impassable, right?If there's boulders there, I'll\ngo rent some excavating equipmentor I'll fill in the potholes.And that's how we get ourselves to go\nforward and to acknowledge and validate.Like, I'm afraid of doing that.If I weren't afraid of doing it, I\nwould have done it already, right?But I now realize what the truth is and\nwhat I brought to bear in the first eight.And I'm going to bring\nmyself to bear for the ninth.That's also when we recruit often\nresources around us where we mightsay, let me tell a couple of good\nfriends about this, or a clergy memberor a therapist or a trusted other and\nlet me explore this more in myself.And that's often how in making\nourselves better, we engagemore with the people around us.And then the support from someone else\nthat may help a person do that, issupport given back to the other person.And this is also how we\nbuild the beyond self.Is that the path to travel down\nthe ninth road, so to speak.We don't have to travel alone much of\nthe time, but that often, almost alwayswasn't in the person's mind, right.They perceive it's a\nthree-person job to go down.It's like, great, you have two friends.Andrew Huberman: Yes, certainly."

            "text": "Where I've been able to travel down\ncertain roads, the key features have beena desire to go down that road, recognition\nof the landscape, but not trying totake on the whole thing all at once.And then finding really good\npeople and frankly, really tryingto avoid people that seemed\npoisonous to the journey, right.That were going to throw toxic\nthings into the engine of my vehicleand that's putting a lot on them.But it just felt as if going down those\nother roads was too valuable an expeditionto spend time on and with people that\nit wasn't helpful to spend time with.And at the same time, there have\nalways been good people that havepresented themselves with examples.I think this is where it comes to mind.It's not always the case that\nyou got a friend who's sayingyou can do this and here's why.Or a therapist that says you\ncan do this and here's why.But that there are examples in the world\nof like, well, this person did this.I think when we have challenges in a\ncertain domain, that ninth road, so tospeak, I know for myself that I know I'm\nin a place of futility when I start toreflexively orient towards others that\nhave had a problem getting down that road.Like, oh, I recognize this other\nperson who's been good at roadsone through eight but not nine.And it occurred to me during the\ncourse of this series, really, thatwhy not pick different examples?Paul Conti: So if you're going on a\njourney and it's a really importantjourney and it's a difficult\njourney, but it can be awesome.Bring good people.Have them on your journey,\nbe on their journey.And then you think, well, why would\na person not bring good people?If I were going on a journey and it's\ngoing to be arduous but, wow, we couldsee amazing things along the way.I can bring a couple of people with me.I don't want to choose a couple of people\nwho are lazy, some who don't look at theworld around them, and some that won't\nbe helpful to somebody else's needs.Why would one choose that?It comes back to the self, right?If a person, now we're\ntalking about any journey.Because it's the journey of life.If a person is choosing\npeople, you wouldn't chooseto be on the journey with you.It's because you don't think\nthat you're worth better.And if you think that you're worth\nbetter, you won't choose the people.You'll say, I want other people like me.I'm going to be diligent,\nperceptive, collegial, cooperative.So I'm going to surround\nmyself with people like that.And if we look beyond ourselves at groups\nof people and at culture, the healthierwe are, the more we ally with healthy\npeople and the more healthy we are.Because we're making ourselves healthy,\nwe get healthier groups of people.The journey is better for all\nof us, and this is how we canmake the whole culture better.Potentially, this is how we can\nmake life on the planet better.But it has to start somewhere.So it has to start with the I.Andrew Huberman: I love, love, love the\nmessage that if you're heading off ona journey that's really meaningful, to\ngo with and make sure that you interactwith good people, this is actually a\nplace where a reference to social mediaand online communities is actually\nworthwhile and can be very beneficial.I think it's easy for us\nto kind of roll our eyes atself-help and things like that.On the other hand, there are communities\nonline that I consider myself a part of,but for which I and many other people\nhave derived a lot of strength, a lotof reassurance and confidence, right?Because a lot of people are isolated.They might have access to one or two\npeople in their community that theyreally value, but those people are\nperhaps also busy with other people.Or I can remember being a student\nalone in my studio apartment as anundergraduate, feeling very much against\nthe grain of my local environment.Too much partying for me at the time,\nmeaning I wasn't partying and therewas a lot of partying around me.And had I been a better student\nin high school, I probably wouldhave been able to healthily engage\nin that, but I just wasn't able.So, feeling pretty isolated,\nbut knowing I was on a path.So in that case, it was one professor,\none graduate student, and a hellof a lot of books and music that,\nto me, just carried me through.Nowadays, I'm fortunate to\nhave many more direct resourcesin my life of amazing people.But I just want to mention that because I\nthink in this discussion around self-careand the various practices, I think there\nare sure to be people who are that kid,that woman, that man that's alone in a\nroom thinking like, okay, but how, right?I see the grocer once a week and I see my\nneighbor, and they don't even say hello.And how to start to access some\nof these better connections.Paul Conti: Navigating the online\nworld is navigating the world.It comes down to understanding and choice.So if we're understanding as best we\ncan, we're making choice as best we can,then we'll find great things online.There're great things to find online.Same is true of life.If we're searching for something that,\nfor example, allies us around hatred,around acting out, around things that make\nus unhappy, even around commiseration,instead of thinking about how we can\nmake things better, then we bringourselves in a different direction.That's life.If we understand and we choose\nas best we can, we will leadourself to better places.Andrew Huberman: Such an important\nmessage and is a perfect segue into a"

            "text": "question that I, and I'm certain many,\nmany other people have about anger.And not just anger from\ninterpersonal conflict.Like somebody said something and\nit really upset me, but stuff thatwe see, stuff that we observe in\nthe world, it could be acts againstother people, words against other\npeople, or that we take reference to.And I think many people feel yanked around\nby, even dragged by something they seeand they can't get it out of their head.Now, there could be all sorts of\nreasons related to each and all of us,why we can't get it out of our head,\nwork that we need to do, et cetera.But according to the map of mental health\nthat you've laid out for us, thingsthat get in the way of that generative\ndrive are really quite poisonous toour well-being and the well-being of\nthe world, because that generativedrive is about learning, creation, and\ntends to be prosocial in so many ways.Tell us about anger and how from a frame\nof reference, of trying to engage inself-care, we should think about our anger\nand work with our anger in ways that canperhaps even help us and not harm us.Paul Conti: In order to really\nunderstand this, and this is soimportant, we have to define three words.And the word to start with is affect.So affect is aroused in us, meaning\nwe don't have control over it.So anger is an affect.It is aroused in us.The idea being that if a person is\nwalking down the street and someonejumps in front of them and shoves\nthem, anger is aroused in them.They don't choose to be angry.In fact, the body reacts and has all sorts\nof fight or flight responses before theperson even realizes that they're angry.So we can't control what is aroused\nin us in the immediate term.We can in the longer term.If I have a short fuse and I get\nangry really easily, I can't reallycontrol that in the next ten minutes.Meaning the affect that's aroused in\nme, I can do different things with it,but I can't change what's created in me.But if I'm living a better life,\ntaking better care of myself, thegenerative drive is better expressed.I have more pleasure in my life.Then what happens is the\nmechanisms that arouse so muchanger start to arouse less anger.So by taking care of ourselves, we arouse\nless anger, but anger is aroused in us.Okay, the next word is feeling.Right again, there are different\ndefinitions for these words, but the waywe're defining them, affect is aroused.Feeling is when we take that affect\nand we relate it to the self, it's thenext thing that happens on the way up.Because the arousal of affect\nis very deep in the brain as itcomes up, the next thing it does\nis relate that affect to self.So this is where the classic\nexample of a person who spillssomething, they are angry.That thing is spilled,\nit raises anger in them.Then they become aware, and\nthey match the anger to selfand say, what a dummy, right?What a jerk.I'll never do anything, right.They say it inside, right?Because the anger gets\nenacted against the self.Now, how would we like that to\ngo where the person is takingbetter care of themselves?So when they spill something,\nless anger is aroused.And by the time it gets to\nconsciousness, there's less anger,so it's easier to manage, and\nthere's a stronger sense of self.All the other aspects of the pillars\nand the cupboards are in a good place.Then the person is better able to\nmanage what anger makes it to feelingand then to say, okay, everybody\nspills something now and then, orwhatever, and then to clean it up.And the person doesn't have to\nenact the anger towards themselves.So affect feeling and then emotion.So emotion is when we relate\nthe affect and the feeling toothers in the world around us.So, for example, a person might spill\nsomething and then it arouses anger, andnow they get to the feeling part, but\nthey have a set of unhealthy defenses,and they don't think they're responsible\nfor things they're responsible for.So they just keep that load of\nanger, right, that affect upwardsuntil they get to emotion.And then they decide, that\nwasn't my fault, it was yours.And that's why maybe they kick the\ndog or they slap somebody or they saysomething mean like, this happens.So if it happens a lot, like this is\npart and parcel of what's going on in us.A lot about negative emotions.There can be dramatic examples, but\nthere's smaller examples that arewinding their way through our lives.And the better we take care of ourselves,\nthe less aroused negative affect wehave and the better we cope with it.When it gets to the level of the I and\nwhen it gets to the level of the you.And if we think about prosocial\ncollaborative behaviors versus theinaction of anger on a large scale, if\nby the time it gets to you there's stilla lot of anger there, it is very easy\nto then paint with a broad brush, right?Oh, the problems are that\ndemographic, the problems arethose people who aren't like me.That's where anger is\nat its most dangerous.So the idea of having the negative affect\nunder control, having the understandingand the control mechanisms, keeps us from\ngetting to that broader level, the levelof you, and then working in ways that\nare not prosocial but are antisocial.And this, I think, also relates\nto what we can find online.We can find online everything\nwe can find in the world.So then we have a choice.Are we going to work on understanding\nwhat choices are we going to makeabout how we're engaging in the world?And if we're choosing the good things,\nwe're taking better care of ourselvesand we're better sort of citizens\nof our relationships, of our familyunits, and ultimately of our societies.Andrew Huberman: I've observed\nanger directed my way.Certainly I'm far, far from perfect.I have thousands of flaws, and\nI've directed anger towards othersin ways that I wish I hadn't.A common observance I've had about\nmyself and others is that when angry,a lot of valuable time is wasted.Instead of placing my efforts within\nthe generative drive, creatingthings that I really value, the\nanger becomes an immense distraction.And I've seen this a lot, not just on\nuniversity campuses, but one place Ihave seen it is when I was a graduate\nstudent or postdoc, there would besome interaction either between them\nin the laboratory I was in, althoughrarely, but more often it was about\nsome interaction between a student orpostdoc and someone in the outside world.And so they'd come in and\nthey'd be really upset about it.And there's a tendency to try and support\none another, which I think is healthy.But then it was like this would just\ncontinue and continue, and the personwould be sitting in their chair.It was really upsetting.And sometimes these were really upsetting\noccurrences that warranted takingsome time and just really stopping.But often I felt like things just kept\nspiraling up and spiraling up, and it'slike halfway through the day, and again,\nI'm not immune from this, but I observedit more than I felt it, certainly.It's like, wow, that's a\nlot of time wasted, days, orperhaps even weeks and months.And then there's the sleep\nloss that goes with anger.I think that's one of the things about\nsocial media and online communitiesthat's new and unique, is that it used\nto be when kids went home from schoolor we go home from work, something\nmight have happened there, but youdidn't have access to more incoming.People weren't calling you on the phone,\ntelling you things that you don't likeor talking about others in ways that\nyou don't like, whereas all you haveto do now is pick up social media.And if you're not really deliberate\nin how you interact with social mediaand on the internet and which news\narticles you read and which ones youscroll past, that can be accessible\nat two in the morning when you're upabout the thing that was angering you\nduring the day, that is new, right?And requires elevated levels of diligence.Paul Conti: Right.High levels of anger bring volatility\nand confusion, and that doesn'tserve anyone or anything well.Lower levels of anger can be healthy.I'm angry at that, and I want to\ntry and make it right, or I'm angryat that, and I'm going to have my\nsay in it, or I'm going to have myvote in it or whatever it may be.Lower levels of anger are okay.They can inform us, they\ncan guide our behaviors.But when we get to high levels of\nanger, it's volatility and confusion.The person ceases to then be effective.And here's an example.When you were telling me about how you\nfeel when you're doing the solo podcast.And how your agency and your gratitude\nare really in action, and you're feelingthe peace and you're delighted, and the\ngenerative drive is at the fore in you.And then I had said, what if we\nadd a little bit of anger, even,right, to kind of make the...And then your response was like, oh,\nit would all come offline, right?Because there you're doing something\nthat calls for, like, you to really beat your best, firing on all cylinders.So even a little bit of anger is too much.But it's a good example because\nit shows, like, you're able to dothis thing that is so good for you.You're living in the place.If you could have all of existence be\nlike you feel, then you would love it.You could bring it to all\nthe rest of your life.Like, that's the nirvana we're going\nfor, and you're actively living it,but we could throw it off and ruin it\nwith even a little bit of anger, right?So it's an example that models for us\nhow higher levels of anger cause problemsin situations that are not so rarefied,\nas that high levels of anger, maybesomebody blurting out, somebody attacking\nsomebody, somebody saying something theyshouldn't, somebody making a bad decision.Anger isn't good for us at high\nlevels, and we can decrease itby making ourselves healthier.Then we make less of it and we\ncontrol it better, and we keepourselves at the low to moderate\nlevels of anger, hopefully low.Again, no, anger is not good.High anger is not good.Let's try and live in the low range.Occasionally, something is very\ndistressing, we rise up to moderate.That's where we have\nanger in a healthy place.Andrew Huberman: When we set out on\nthis journey to explore what is mentalhealth, I had no expectation that you\nwould deliver to us this incredible map"

    "episode_summary": "This is episode 4 of a 4-part special series on mental health with Stanford and Harvard-trained psychiatrist Dr. Paul Conti, M.D. Dr. Conti explains what true self-care is and how our mental health benefits from specific self-care and introspection practices \u2014 much in the same way that our physical health benefits from certain exercise and nutrition habits. He describes how the foundation of mental health is an understanding of one\u2019s own mind and the specific questions to ask in order to explore the conscious and unconscious parts of ourselves. He describes how this process can be done either on our own, through journaling, meditation and structured thought, or in therapy with the help of a licensed professional. He also explains how unprocessed trauma can short-circuit the process and how to prevent that, and the role of friendships and other relational support systems in the journey of self-exploration for mental health. People of all ages and those with and without self-introspection and therapy experience ought to benefit from the information in this episode.\nFor show notes and additional resources, please visit hubermanlab.com.\nThank you to our sponsors\nAG1:\u00a0https://drinkag1.com/huberman\nBetterHelp: https://betterhelp.com/huberman\nWaking Up: https://wakingup.com/huberman\nMomentous:\u00a0https://livemomentous.com/huberman"
