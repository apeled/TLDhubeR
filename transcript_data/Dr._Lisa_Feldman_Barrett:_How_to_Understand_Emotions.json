            "text": "expressions andemotions because as you were explainingthe core components ofemotions I had to think back to to theclassic textbook images of the differentfaces associated with fear with delightwith confusion on and on we we will getto that and your opinions on thatscientifically informed opinions ofcourse but there is a bit of a myth thatthe emotion system and the facialexpression system run in both directionsforinstance people will say if you smileit's harder to feel sad oranxious I can't say that's been myexperience but I very well could bewrong so we know that when people'semotional states change their facialexpressions often will change right ifyou see someone crying on the street umversus somebody smiling really big youwe can make some assumptions about whatmight be going on at uh internally forthem but put simply is it true thatchanging one's facial expressioncan direct shifts in the brain and bodyperhaps that change our emotional statesif you'll permit me what I would say isthat your question is illposed so first of all it presumes thatthere's an emotionsystem and that there's a facialexpression system now clearly there's asystem for moving facial muscles okaybut a movement is not the same as anexpression a movement is a movement anexpression is an interpretation of themeaning of a movement not all movementsof the face areexpressions um and this is a you know aproblem it's a problem in science um init's often the case uh I think in myexperience in the science of emotion butelsewhere to that scientists in theirefforts to make their workum meaningful to people will try tointerpret their findings in in ways thatuh the average person would um findinteresting or the way that a physicianwould find interesting or a teacher orwhat have you to be able to use thisinformation but then they forget thatthey're actually making aninterpretation and they start to referto their observations with the labels ofinterpretation so facial movements arefacial movements people move their facesand that those movements have meaningbut they're not always to express aninternal state in fact one might thinkthat they're very rarely to um Expressan internal state so I don't know thatthere's a facial expression systemeither so that's there is certainly likeI said um there there's circuitry formoving a face but um but what thosemovements mean um is highly variable andso that would be my second point thatwhere I would say when you see someonecrying on the street you are not lookingonly at their face you might beaware um that you're focusing on theirface that might be the part of theentire sensory Ensemble that you arefocusing your attention on but yourbrain is taking in an entire ensemble ofsignals as you know it's taking in notjust the you know movements of the facethat tears or whatever it's taking inall of the the entire sensory array TheSounds the smells what's going on insideyour own body your brain is being umbombarded with signals from from all ofthose sources and when it's making anmeaning out of any signal it's doing itin an ensemble of signals so researchshows that baby'scries aren't acoustically specific towhen they're tired or hungry or right umthe you can I can show you a videowithout context and show you someonecrying and um you might make a judgmentyou might think make the stereotypicjudgment in the west oh that person issad and then we pan out and really youknow it's a little girl whose dad justcame home from Iraq or something rightso brains are always interpreting facesin context they're making guesses thisis something that I've talked aboutquite a bit that we don't read movementsin people we don't read emotions infacial Expressions we make inferencesabout the emotional meaning of facialmovements and we do it in an ensemble ofother signals the the context uh as youif you will and that's really what'swhat's happening so um do I think thatum that there is feedback from the faceto the brain sure I mean there'sfeedback from every muscle but there'sthis constant conversation between thebrain and the body um the brain issending motor commands the body is youknow has sensory surfaces which aresending signals back to the brain so ifthe face is influencing the brain it'sdoing so in a way that's not special itit's doing it in a way that that worksfor all other parts of your body too andIguess what I would say this kind oflong-winded answerbut over time your brain haslearned that certain patterns of signalovertime um recur and so if you're smilingif your brain is you know telling youryour facial muscles to move in aparticular way that looks like smilingum it's happening in a larger Ensembleof signals and then the brain ispredicting what's going to happen nextbecause it's learned over timewhat happens next so probabilisticallyso if you think about that as cause thensure but it's not as it's not thissimplistic kind of idea that an emotionis triggered um uh itcauses facial muscles to move in aparticular way and therefore if you justpose your face in in those in thatparticular Arrangement it that willsomehow feed back to the emotion systemand change that system because there areno there is no emotion system in yourbrain and the the causation just isn'tthat it's not that simplisticallymechanistic that makes sense to me I Iuh frankly never bought the idea thatjust smiling would make me feel happy umespecially if my internal state was notone of Happiness like fighting theinternal state also um in the early2000s I think it was there was a lot ofdiscussion about how positioning thebody in certain ways you know taking upmore space would allow people to feelmore powerful and they some of thesestudies um and uh argued that there wereeven hormonal shifts associated with umtaking up more space that wereassociated with feelings of empowermentand then when shrinking of oneself wasin associated with elevated cortisolStates and as I say all this I'm I Iwant to be clear that um do not take asimplistic view of the nervous system orendocrine system and I I didn't um Idon't think that you were implying thateither so want to make sure that anyonelistening or watching isn't thinkingthat uh for instance that cortisol isbad cortisol is wonderful and essentialyou just need it regulate properly orthat um the idea that the body andemotional states are are inextricablylinked makes a ton of sense to me butthe idea that you could just you knowgrab onto one of the nodes in the EM nowI have to be careful not say emotionsystem um like position of the body likebeing hunched over makes you depressedno that never made sense to me taking upmore space makes you feel more uhpowerful that doesn't it it can't bethat way and yet we were told for abouta decade through especially throughpopular press that this stuff was trueum and so what I love about your work isthat it includes a neuroanatomical apsychological a Network perspective thatthat there isn't one seat of emotionsand and so on um so if we could go alittle bit further into the facial"

            "text": "expression piece for a momentsure I was taught in my Psychology andNeuroscience textbooks because it wasright there in front of me that therewere some core categories of facialexpression that were Universal crosscultures that conveyed something aboutthe internal state of the person thatthe downward you know lips in the cornerand and some and maybe even a furrowingof the brow was associated with negativeveent States like sadness perhaps evendepression that the opposite of upwardturn corners of the mouth and wideningof the eyes was delight and excitementsome of that feels pretty true to myexperience but how do you and otherserious scientists of emotions view thatsomewhat classic literature now yeah soI'll just say that my ummy journey here my scientific Journeywas not one of um attempting tooverturn um a Century's worthof are we alled to swearbasically I mean it's just it's likeit's it's stereotyp it's basicallyWestern stereotypes enshrined asscientific uh fact and that sounds likea pretty harsh thing to say but I thinkI pretty much stand by that at thispointum but for me when I was a graduatestudent When I Was An undergraduate inuh in Psychology and in physiology andin anthropology you know I also had readthat Darwin said that there were thesedistinctive facial expressions that umwere coordinated with specific emotionalstates specific states of the nervoussystem this was Darwin's View and Iassumed it was correctum until I started to try to use thatinformation um in the lab and everythingfell apart you know so when you showsomeone in uh a laboratory like astudent or um somebody from thecommunity a face a disembodied facewhere their the person's eyes arewidened in the face and they're gaspinglike a stereotypic fearexpression most of the time they don'tknow what itis and so I would try to use these facesand um as stimuli and experiments andthey W they weren't working the way thatthey were supposed to work and therewere really going all the way back tothe beginning of psychology there werealways debates about whether or not thiswas actually accurate and there's areally interesting story about howDarwin came to this idea um which I cantell you about but it it's not becausehe cared about emotion and he wasbasically taking his own very Westernviews about emotion to make some claimsabout Evolution actually so um I havemore to say about that andabout why it's a problem to takeanything that anybody said even Darwinfrom you know 150 or so years ago orwhatever it is and treat it like it's amodern text you know he was writing at aparticular time for a particular purposeum and that doesn't necessarily meanthat whatever he wrote istrue um but I'll just tell you what theevidencesays um that there has been inPsychology a debate really viciousdebate actually for probably 50 yearsabout the nature of facial expressionsand whether they are Universal andwhether there's this onetoonecorrespondence between a particular faceand like a facial configuration in aparticular emotional state smiling inhappiness scowling in Anger wrinklingyour nose and disgust and so in2016 I think the association forpsychologicalscience um tasked me and some otherseniorscientists uh with attempting to write awhite paper a consensus paper on whatthe literature actually show so whatdoes the research actually show if youread all the research you know can youfind a pattern there does it actuallyreveal anything about whether or notfacial expressions are Universalparticularly for emotion um and the waythey do this they have a journal forthis purpose for taking a widely heldbelief that is highly debated andbringing together a panel of experts whodisagree with each other at the outsetand they have to work together to see ifthey can come to consensus overthedata and this is something that you knowpeople have tried in the past and I meanthey're really vicious people have beenvicious with each other over thisquestion so when we brought together a agroup of people so me several peoplerefused to serve senior scientistsrefused to serve on this panel but outof fear of losing their funding orsomething um you know that's a wholeother conversation aboutwhy SC certain scientists would not wantto engage W uh with um people whodisagree with them um that's aninteresting conversation to have but umI don't think it's as simple actually asjust they their careerist or they theycare about you know their money or orfunding or whatever that would be aneasy answer but I don't actually thinkthat's what's going on but that'sanother sort of but anyway so uh therewere five of us who got together um allsenior scientists all from differentfields some of us hadn't met each otherbefore we all knew of each other ofcourse and we met over Zoom for two anda half years this is preco becausepeople were all over the world right andwe we read over a thousand papers so soI was the only one in this group of thefive of us who my starting hypothesiswas that facial movements are meaningfulbut they're not there's no one-o-onecorrespondence between a particularfacial configuration like ascowl and anger not not just that itwould vary across cultures but that itvaries AC for you across situations Imean do you scowl every time you'reangry I don't scowl every time I'm angryin fact and I also scowl at times whenI'm not angryso and there are scientific reasons tothink that that the that a thecollection of facial expressions thatpeople make when they're angry or whenthey're sad or whatever would be highlyvariable so that was my startingposition and then the there were varyingfour guys so there was I just refer tothem as the guys because it was me andfour guys and the guys they all to someextent thought that facial expressionswere Universal but they had differingreasons and all for for forhypothesizing that and theyalso had different commitments degreesof commitment tothat position but we right off the batsort of agreed that we it didn't matterwho was right that was just not relevantthe only thing that mattered was that wecould come to the consensus over thedata and if we couldn't we had to reallypinpoint why like so what would be thecritical experiments that would have tobe done in order for us to come toconsensus over the data and we alsoagreed that um we had all kinds ofcontingency set up so you know you'vegot five senior people who are allrunning big labs and they're investingyou know upwards of three years workingon a paper so if we can't come toconsensus what are we going to do are wegoing to write one paper and sort ofwrite about the process or are we goingto write separate papers or you know butwe we had all these contingencies laidout but the key here I think is that weagreed that we were not going to beadversarial about it because it didn'tmatter who was right and in fact ifsomebody had to admit they were wrongand someone was going to have to admitthey were wrong I mean it turns out allof us were wrong about something but itwe were going to be like supportive ofeach other and and really encourage eachother um because you know being wrong isno one likes to be wrong but forscientists to admit they're wrong ishard and it's something that we shouldencourage each other to do I think moreand and morepublicly and I think the people who dothat are really Brave and so that was myposition and they all agreed and thelong story short here isthat two and a half years a thousandpapers later we all very reasonably cameto consensus that there was no evidencefor facial expressions of emotion beingUniversal and that instead what is whatthere's clear evidence of is um thatfacial expressions the way that peoplemove their faces in in in moments ofexpression is highly variablemeaning sometimes in Anger you scowlmeta analyses so statistical summariesof many many many studies even in thewest show that peoplescowl about 35% of the time when they'reangry which is more than chance so itget you a good publication in you knowthe proceedings of the NationalAcademy but that means 65 % of thetime people are moving their faces inother meaningful ways that's notscowling so if you actually used ascowl um or even you know a scowl inblood pressure or you know just maybenot one signal but like a couple signalsbut you would be wrong more than halfthe time you would miss more than halfthe cases and even moreimportantly I think that that's thereliability question so there's lowreliability for um the thecorrespondence between a scowl and angerit's above chance so scowling is oneexpression of anger but it's certainlynot the dominant one and there is nodominant one it's just highly variabledepending on the situation that you'rein so sometimes when I'm angry I sitquietly and plot the demise of my enemyyou know sometimes I smile in AngerSometimes I Cry in Anger it reallydepends on thesituation um but more importantly halfof the scowls that people make are notrelated toanger that means that thespecificity isagain higher thanchance but not that much higher thanchance so if you see someonescowling the chances are that they mightnot be angry they might be concentratingreally hard or they might have gas Imean there are a lot of reasons whypeople make a SC owl um and we foundthis for every emotion category that hadever been studied and I want you tonotice what I just did there I'm not I'm"

            "text": "no longer referring to an emotion as ifit's an entity or a thing so anger isn'tone thing it's a category of things agrouping of things and if I'm notmistaken it includes verbs right thatlike anger as a set of verb actions inthe in the brain and body yes it's aprocess it's not an event processexactly it's not a noun it's a verb andit's a and it's a process but the pointis that um it's it's a highly variablegrouping ofinstances if you're if you are talkingabout all instances of anger allinstances of anger that you have everexperienced or witnessed um is a highlyvariable grouping of instances That Varythat they that doesn't mean they'rerandom but what the body does in Angerdepends on what the physical movementswill be in anger and that depends on thesituation that you're in and what yourgoal is and um and there are ways totalk about that in Neuroscience termswhich are a little more precise but theimportant thing to understand here Ithink is that we're only talking aboutWestern cultures now the minute that yougo outside of the West to or even to theeast I mean so you know there are othercultures you know that have been studiedum like uh China and cultures in Chinain Japan in Korea they they all haveaccess to knowledge about Westerncultural practices a norm so whathappens when you go to you know toremote cultures which um have much lessaccess so they it's not like they haveno access because we live in aglobalized world so even huntergatherers in Tanzania the hza haveaccess to Western practices and Normsbut much less much less and we did dothat and and um and all bets are offthere I mean most of the time they don'teven they don't even understand orexperience facial movements as havinganything to do with emotion so if theysaw an emoji of a smiley face would theyjust assume it was a couple they mightthink it's a face there because as weboth know there's some fairly hardwiredbrain circuitry for the the two eyes anda and a line beneath it and something inthe middle that's pseudo nose thatorganization of just spatial featurescues up face for both for most pratesit's really interesting that you saythat because yes of course that's truebut it's not there at Birth what's thereat Birth is a preference for thatconfiguration right so it's it's likethere's some and we could talk about whythat's there it's actually verycontroversial but um but what babieswhat newborns Orient to they Orient tothat or they Orient to thatconfiguration but it doesn't have to bea face and then very quickly they startlearning faces because they're exposedto fa I mean really the first threemonths of life is almost like a massivecontinuous tutorial on what faces arebecause they're you know being fed andand everyone's in your face saw a babylast night and you see the baby friendsof have a unbelievably cute baby withthe big cheeks and you want and there'sthis desire to see the baby smile rightso you do the things that and if thatthe baby shows some sort of facialexpression that makes it seem like it'sa little bit um like resist in whatyou're doing you you stop doing it youchange up your strategy and then whenbaby cracks a smile like now I'm goingto assume that the baby may or may nothave been happy inside um that littlebaby head um but when they do there's areciprocity then we smile there's atemplate that that's very robust rightbut I want you to notice though that sofirst of all I'm not saying that um thatrecognizing faces a face as a face isnot hardwired it is but it's hardwiredby not by genes alone right and in factthere's a really wonderful book callednot by genes alone basically there'scultural inheritance we have the kind ofnature that requires nurture we have thekind of genes that require EarlyLearning we have we need wiringinstructions from the world to get therest of the information that we need tobe competent culturally competent in ourin our in our lives and that starts atBirth it probably starts before birtheven um but um in the third trimesterthere's some evidence of learning fetallearning even in the third trimester soum the point is not that people aren'thardwired for viewing faces orrecognizing faces it's just where doesthat hard wirring come from it's not bygenes alone genes aren't the blueprintthe brain is expecting certain inputsfrom the world and it needs that becauseinfant brains are wiring themselves totheir world and part of that world ispeople making faces at them and smilingand those people happen to also be theones who are maintaining who aremaintaining that baby's nervous system Imean there is reward learning right orreinforcement learning right off the batbecause these are the people who keepyou comfortable they are the ones whofeed you they're the ones who help youget to sleep and so on and so forth andso you're going to be very verysensitive to changes in thecontingencies of their behavior yourbrain as a pattern learner is just goingto learn those patterns if we know thatsmiling is more you know smiling is acue for happiness it's because we'velearned it and that doesn't mean thatthat learning isn't hardwired it justmeans that it that

            "text": "ask which is um it's based on somethingthat I think is in very much agreementwith what you're saying a previous gueston this podcast I think it was our firstguest episode Dr Carl di Roth colleagueof mine at Stanford incrediblebioengineer um really you know0.01% in his you know category ofscience as well as a practicing uhpsychiatrist said something which reallystuck with me over the years which Ionce heard him say you know we don'treally know how other people feel at allin fact most of the time we don't evenknow how we feel and that prompted thequestion for me about how good or poorare we at gauging our own emotionalstates and in particular at labelingthem both to others and for ourselvesand and so here's the the directquestion is language sufficient tocapture this incredibly complex thingthat we're calling emotions so forinstance the other day I was in New Yorkwith my sister then she left I went outfor a bit I was having a pretty good dayand then I returned to the place where Iwas staying and I was hit with thisfeeling of intense loneliness and Idon't know why and then I had a bunch ofideas about how that related to growingup and but I was going to see friendsthe next day and I'm an adult and so Icould use some top down regulation andsay oh you know maybe I'm a little tiredor I didn't because I hadn't slept aswell the night before I've been prettyrested recently and then I actuallywrote in my journal I I said you knowmaybe most of feeling good is beingpretty well rested and not in anyphysical pain that's a big part offeeling good is the absence of fatigueand the absence of physicalpain and and then I thought wow that'sjust so basic that's like two bill buingblocks is clearly insufficient but thenI couldn't think of a word to adequatelydescribe the emotion that came about anhour later when I was feeling a littlebit better but not completely better sowas I lonely not really not anymore wasI sad not really but you know as I hadheaded out into the city I was thinkingI don't really have a word for how Ifeel I'm sort of okay not great not lowyou know and so I think that we haveemotional labels I certainly do for Peakyou know these Peak emotional statessuper happy I loved the time with mysister we do this every year this was aparticularly good year for us um to dothis and and it went really well we weretexting back and forth how great it wasI certainly know what it feels like tobe really down in the in the pits I'vegot language for that but then there'sthis huge range in between and so Iguess the simple question is should weeven trust language as a wayto understand how we're feeling or arethere additional if not better signalsthat we should perhaps learn toelaborate um our understanding ofemotionswith so I'm going to give you a a simpleanswer and then I'm going to give you amore complicated answer right so thesimple answer is no language is notsufficient period I think the way thatyou have well I should say one languageis not sufficient so English is notsufficient and probably French on itsown is not sufficient and probablySwahili on its own is not sufficientalthough it's very interesting that thethe states that we Mark with words ineach culture some of them overlap but alot of them don't and it's very veryuseful to have labels of emotionConcepts from other cultures that thatcapture configurations or a state thatwe we don't really Mark we don't Markthose and and sort of distinctively pullthem out as as different from otherstates I'd love to know what some ofthose are oh there there um I shouldhave brought them with me I mean therethere are some like there's one there'sa German word which I can't remember thename of the word but it's like um theexperience of someone having a face thatdeserves a punch I'm sure someone willtell us in the comments someone someonewho knows German or spend time thereplease put that word in in the commentsbut don't don't punch any another onethat's my favorite is um um liot whichis is um it's a Polynesian um headhunting um uh emotion word and itmeans um exuberant aggression in agroup like soccer or or headhunting right where you're basically umor I should say also um in the militaryso when I was listening to m one day Acouple of years ago must have been morethan that because it's in my book so itwas probably more than seven years agoI was listening to these guys talk theseformer um um military uh Personnel talkabout being um deployed in a war wherethey're with their buddies andthey're they're basically hunting theenemy and theyfeel exuberant like they're you know andand they're it's not that they're happybut they're it's Pleasant and it's veryintense very high arousal you know andin the moment it it seemed right andthen they come back um you know and theyask themselves like they come back andso they're now you know theirdeployments ended now they're back homeand they're like am I a psychopath likeI enjoy killing people what is thisabout and I was thinking no no you justexperienced liot and if you had a wordfor it you would understand that it's agroupy feeling where you're all in ittogether and it's really intense and youknow they were experiencing the um theintensity of of um having their life onthe line and and being responsible fortheir for their brothers you know andsisters in in in their troop you know soum the the what they would realize isit's a perfectly it's perfectly withinthe range of normal human variation it'sjust that in English we don't have aword for it really but there are wordsthere are Concepts in other languagesright or the other one that I like iscalled gigle which is where when you seea baby who's really cute and you justwant to like oh you yesterday eveningsquee oh my God that kid was so cutethose little cheeks are just likejumping at you and and the parents aredelightful people too and they was justfacing out cuz they had one of thoseoutward facing baby things and it's justsort of like yeah it's and I thinkleit's called it's gigle gigle oh keigleis from the other episode that we did onwell it also has to do with babies butyeah in a different way um or there'sone in I think there's a Japaneseword for the despair that you feel whenyou got a badhaircut really yeah cuz it's I mean it'sreally is a different kind of feelingthan you know because you got to likewait for it to grow up you know whateveranyways the point being that amazingwords for us Mark particular States andthey're not all the they're not alwaysthe states that other people in othercultures care about but I there's a butthe even again the phrasing of your"

developedhow it structured right Anatomy to me isvery important some of my besthypotheses come from just learning theanatomy and realizing oh well there's aconnection there that's direct that meanthat should mean something you know Imean um I could give you lots ofexamples of um uh where we've had we'vemade discoveries solely because wenoticed an an a set of anatomicalconnections and were're really curiousabout what they might be involved withbut if you start with that premise thenyou think about the brain in I thinkabout the brain a really different wayright so I don't think about the brainas a stimulus drivenorgan um I think about it more like thisthat the the brain isum first of all the brain is not runninga model or or making inferences aboutthe worldall the brain knows is are signals fromthe sensory surfaces of its body so yourbrain is modeling your retina and it'smodeling your ca and it's modeling thesensory surfaces of theskin and sure signals you know are youknow hit those surfaces and thosesurfaces transduce those signals andsend them up to thebrain but the brain only knows the bodyand anything it knows about the world itknows about the world through the bodythrough the sensory surfaces of the bodyso that's the first for me really bigimportant point the second importantpoint is that I think about the brain asbeing trapped in a dark silentbox called your skull you know and it'sso weird saying these things to youyou're so much you know you're likeyou're this really esteemed likeneuroscientist in here I am explainingto you how I think the brain works it'sjust very you know what's important forour audience but it's also important forme even though yes I know I know thesefacts but it's I believe it's always uhinformative to go back to thefundamentals because we forget you knowactually I would say that the uh someoneonce described um the I'll call him thegreat because he's a great visualneuroscientist uh visual neuroscientistTony maavin who founded the departmentof of neuroscience at NYU once said youknow a real intellectual is somebodythat can appreciate and work with atopic at multiple levelsit's not and oftentimes the more expertiis associated with more focus on detailso I love returning to the core Basicsso I I think it's wonderful pleaseplease continue so I think about thebrains being trapped in this box and umit's receiving signals continuously fromthe sensory surfaces of the body butthose signals are the outcomes of someset of changes and the brain doesn'tknow what the changes are it doesn'tknow the causes of those signals it justknows the outcomes it knows the signalsthat's what it's receivingand so it has to guess at what thecauses of those signals are in order tostayaliveum and so that's in philosophy called aninverse problem so the brain just has amassive continuous inverse problem thatit has to deal with all the time like itcan't have it doesn't have access to allthe information no it's just a guessingmachine it's a guessing machine so forexample um you know if you hear a loudbang what is that loud bang could be acar door slamming it could be thunder itcould be a car backfiring it could be agunshot the brain doesn't know it has toguess and it's not making a guess likeuh intellectual guess the Guess is amotor plan it's a plan for changing theinternal state of the body in order tosupport motor skeletal motor movementsdo I do I need to run do I need to shutthe window do I need to get an umbrellado I you know do I need to hold mybreath because the car is backfired youknow what do I need to do so where doesthat plan comefrom well it comes from past experiencethe experience that's been wired intothebrain um what the I think that theevidence suggests that what the brain isdoing isbasically reinstatingbits and pieces of past experience soremembering although we don't experienceourselves as remembering but basicallyit's reimplementing ensembles ofsignals from the past that are similarto the present in someway now a bunch of things which aresimilar to eachother in Psychology is acategory so what the brain is doing isit's creating a it's constructing acategory and in fact we think about thebrain as a continuous categoryConstructor it's constructing a categoryof possible Futures possible outcomespossible motorplansand how does it know which is the rightone because it's not just picking onethere's going to be some sample thatit's re it's re-implementing but howdoes it know which one which is theright one because there can only be onewell I feel like in the example of aloud noisewhat I immediately thought of as youwere describing that is that my systemwould become aware of it I would becomeaware of it but then it's a question ofis there another loud noise how closelyare those loud noises spaced is itgetting louder or less loud and then andso a bunch of categories it it's like abookshelf with an infinite number ofbooks but then with the second loudnoise now it's just you know one uh wingof the library and then with the thenext thing that happens and the contextit starts narrowing and then pretty soonyou get presented with the book thatsays you know the roof is about to cavein sure and and I think your your POyour your analogy there is pointing outtwo things one is that um really why whythe what the brain is attempting to dois to reduceuncertainty because uncertainty is superexpensive now sometimes we likedeliberately you know cultivateuncertainty right like we do not youknow we deliberately try to learn thingswe don't you know that we don't know wewe you know put ourselves novelsituations you know we seek novelty andbecause it's fun and interesting andwhatever sure but imagine every singlewaking moment of your life was like thatwhere you didn't know you couldn'tnarrow things down from the library tothe wing to the Bookshelf to the youknow the to the the particular shelf onthat bookshelf to yeah you terrifyingyeah it would be that's the label Iwould give it it would be terrifying cuzI couldn't plan anything or do anythingbecause all possibility are open rightit's and it's just actuallymetabolicallyunsustainable and you know there aresome there are some brains that arewired in a way that they don't predictvery well they don't create thesecategories very well and so they'rethey're dealingwith in really unbelievable amounts ofuncertainty so that's one thing I is butthat part of what's the goal here if youcould say there's a goal is to reduceuncertainty and I'm going to get whythis has anything to do with emotion ina minute but I I just need to set up theground rules or the assumptions uh youknow of what I'm what I'm working withhere so the other thing though that youpointed out which I think is reallyimportant is that the um none of this isstatic it's all evolving over time rightthe signals are evolving over time soboth the signals that are constantlyhitting the sensory surfaces of the bodyand making their way to the brain butalso the intrinsic signals in the brainit's all changing over time so when wetalk about context that's important howis the brain making a decision aboutsimilarity like what are the featuresthat are similar it's it's not just at asingle snapshot in time it's alwayshappening dynamically over time rightand most of the timethough you don't ask your you don't waitto hear a second sound you don't you'renot deliberately attempting to figureout what the sound is your brain is justsorting it out right and it's sorting ItOut by narrowing down the possibilitiesand there are some selection mechanismsin the brain that help it guess betterbut also the signals coming from theworld um are are also helping to selectwhichpossibility um is the right one I'd liketo take a quick break and acknowledge"

everything's astimulus to move and to end and thensome of the moreseasoned soldiers are literally havingbullets whizzing by their head andpeople are dropping Dead all around themand they're moving forward steeli andstable and upright and in part we lookat that and and say okay they'recourageous they're seasoned maybethey're desensitized in certain ways butactually it fits much better with theidea based on what you're saying it fitsmuch better with the idea that um theyhave intimate knowledge both consciousand unconscious knowledge that somethingright next to them is a threat but not athreat worth responding to right exactlybut if it were headed straight for themthey would quite quite understand what Iwould say it's is that it's um it's notuh you know I keep referring to thingsas signals and really I'm just I'mthat's like my generic word for aquantity of energy of some sort you knowbut your brain my brain every brain isconstantly making signal noise distinctyou know like distinctions do I need tocare about this do I do I not need tocare about this right and we have waysof learning and we also have ways ofqueuing each other so um you know humansuse eye gaze to cue each other aboutwhat is signal and what is noise rightso if you and I were sitting or let'ssay we were at a coffee shop and we werein a part of town that i' had never beento before and we were sitting havingcoffee and you know a loud siren went byif you turned and looked i' wouldprobably turn and look because you justcued me that that was something I needto care about if you ignored it I'dprobably ignore it because you just cuedme that I I didn't need to worry aboutit I didn't need to care and we'reconstantly doing that with each otherand we also do it with little babies andwith kids and that's how we teachchildren this is signal this is noisethis you need to worry about this youcan ignore and so yeah your yourdescription is perfect so what does thishave to do any of this have to do withemotion in order to answer that part ofthe question I I I want tosay so okay you've got these signals thebrain is like has these electricalsignals going on we'll just ignore thehormonal signals for the moment becausethat's complic you know one iscomplicated so it's got all theseelectrical signals going on it's whenit's remembering something it's justbasically reinstating a pattern ofsignals and it's got these signalscoming in um from the sensory servfacesokay so what's so what is the braindoing it's a signal processor so what isit I don't mean a computer I mean asignal processor in the engineeringsense so what's it what is it doingwithout getting into all the Dynamicsof prediction and you know whatever whatthe brain is doing is it's um it'sassembling a set offeatures it's some of the features thatit's assembling are very close in detailto the sensory surfaces of the body soin primary visual cortex there's aretinotopic map the details there arevery very low level like a line an edgeyou know same thing in primary auditorycortex right it's tonotopic so there aretonesbut it's very very very lowlevel detailsand we might there are many many manymany of these little features so wewould say there there's a it's a highdimensional array lots and lots and lotsand lots of features and then and let'sjust talk about one structure just thecerebral cortex let's not worry aboutjust but what I'm about to say isbasically true of really the rest of thebrain as well if you take the cortex offthe surface uh the cortical sheet offthe that wavy you know cortical sheetyou take it off the rest of the brainthe subcortical parts and you stretch itout like a napkin you can see there's acompression gradient there in thearchitecture of the neurons so at theprimary sensory areas there are thesetiny little paramal neurons that arerepresenting these little these verylow-level features and they feed intobigger neurons which feed into biggerneurons which feed into more biggerneurons so what's happening is you'vegot this very detailed arraybeing compressed in its dimensionalityuntil you get to the middle of the brainat the front where there are many fewerneurons but they're bigger and they havemany more connections so it's adimensionality reduction that'shappening so just to make sure Iunderstand um correctly and that theaudience understands the physical worldobviously is um transformed by oursensory apparati the retina the ca thethe sensing neurons in our skinumal things mechan pressure phon soundwaves okay that's translated into neuralcode which is chemical and electricalyeah and and those sensory inputs areare fairly vast and you call highdimension high dimensionality so lots ofdifferent orientations of lines lot evenyou know even though it originates withjust three uh cone photop pigments lotsof opportunity for encoding differentshades of color contrast okay and all ofthat so you have lots of little neuronsto represent all the possibilities ofthe physical world that are occurring MHbut as that information is passedfurther up along EXC I have to becareful with the use of hierarchiesbecause that's controversial nowadaysnot for political reasons but foraccuracy reasons um as that informationis passed along there's more umconvergence onto a smaller number oflarger neurons so these are neurons thathave access to a lot of information butin coarser form right so there are lowyou know it's like like compressing anMP3 like how an MP3 compressesinformation for example so the cortex isrepresentingfeatures so and I represent I'm justusing that in a generic way becausethat's also controversial about exactlyhow is the okay but yeah but it worksbut for now I'm using it just in ageneric way so you go from lines andedges to a shape like a round shape to aface to a right so you're you'rebasically you're you're um you're goingwhat's happening is there aresummaries of summaries of summaries ofsummies I love that I hope everyonehears that because I've been in thisfield of Neuroscience a long time as youmove along the neur axis from thesensory epithelium now it sounds veryvery Gomen clish but from the surface ofthe skin inward you're getting summariesyeah they send more and more summaries Ithink that's so important I that's athat's a like a gazillion dollarstatement for understanding of thenervous system so but each of thosepoints correspond to some mental featurelike a line or an edge or a circle or asquare or a face or right but but nowthen you when you when you're in themidline at the front what are thosefeatures well those features are thingslike they are they are multimodalsummaries meaning they are summaries ofthe sights and sounds and smells andright but they and they are lowerdimensional meaning they are they'recoarser so there are things like threatrewardpleasure I mean really abstract that'swhat abstract means it doesn't mean thatthose representations have no sensory ormotor meaning it means that threat forexample asummary can have many different patternsassociated with it and the brain istreating them all as equivalent thisthis to me again feels so so importantfor people to understand because um asI'm hearing this and this word summariesis just ringing in my mind it's soimportant because one of the corecomponents of my experience of myemotions because that's all I can reallysay for sure mysubjective interpretation and labelingof my own emotions is that they arepretty broad bins like I described earpretty broad bins and so that that'swhere I was exactly where I was goingso what about the word anger where isthat represented like well that's athat's a one of these multimodalabstractions in fact anger is just acouple of phones it's a couple of soundsbut those sounds the sound of angercorresponds over thousands of instancesthat you've learned in your life to verydifferent patterns of sensory motorfeatures that's right because what'sgoing on in yourbody during anger can vary what the wayyou move your face in Anger can varydepending on the situation what you seesomeone else doing in Anger can vary andso the word anger or any word isactually just a multi Al summary of manymany many many instances which are intheir sensory and motor features thesensory and motor meaning very differentand and it seems to me are highlyconstrained by Developmental andcultural experience absolutely becausejust today I learned that there's a wordin Japan for the feeling that one has ofhaving gotten a haircut they don't likethere's a word in Germanythat pertains to the feeling of wantingto punch someone specifically because ofthe look on their face well really it'smore like you like you they to you itfeels like they're asking to be punchedin the face even so you added yet moredimensionality to it so upon learningjust those things just today there isadditional dimensionality brought insuch that if I were to ever um want topunch somebody in the face simplybecause of the look on theirface that I wouldn't NE necessarilylabel that as anger alone it now hasanother dimension to it and so I I thinkI'm finally I think I'm finally startingto understand how the Developmental andthe cultural influences plus the factthat language is a pretty crudedescriptor for this neural process thatyou're describing oh absolutelyabsolutely but okay so but but beforeyou use the word granularity and so I'm"

sign an emoji you're hetingsomething you're giving a thumbs up or athumbs down so I almost feel like wewe're trying to uh we we're regressingto a state where we're kind of like aninfant trying to figure out like whatthe hell is going on and we're sayingyou know what you get like sixcategories of response when in realityum we should probably be expanding thenumber of different responses that wecan have in order to accurately matchthe way that our nervous system actuallyworks yes exactly there are manydifferent things we could talk aboutwith respect to the summary that youjust gave which I I think is completelyaccurate so what I would say is that ifyou look through even just the last Idon't know hundred or so years like the19th you know 19th 20th centuries maybeyou can see that the complexity of theof people'sresponses expands and contracts right sofor example this is something that I'vewritten really speculatively aboutum but one of the things that I foundreally interesting um is that you knowauthoritarianism authoritarian thinkingis the reduction of complexity to somethings that are really really simplelike you're getting rid of all thecomplexity to you know basically thesevery very coarse low dimensionaljudgments and Things become black andwhite um it's the avoid ofcomplexity um so that there can besimple single answers to things and ithappens in human culture at times andthen then there's an expansion ofcomplexity at times too so what predictsthat like what is it in the humannervous system or our Collective humannervous you know like we're we're just abunch of brains attached to bodiesinteracting with other brains and bodiesright so like what is it that causesthese um ripples of and and I have somethoughts about that that are reallyreally reallyspeculative um but I think the otherthing that's that's really important isthat we've talked about we'll go back toour our cortical sheet that we've and bythe way this is just one compressiongradient in the brain there are otherstoo right um there are at least fourothers that I can think of um so this isjust one but all compression gradientswork the same way which is that nowwe've talked about going from thelow-level details um compressing tothese multimodal summaries these reallylike simple um features that are rightbut thatcompression is what Engineers would calllossy meaning you lose theinformation you lose theinformation so when you go from linesand edges to a face those neurons theyjust know the face they don't have theylose what they've thrown away thedetails they've thrown away thosedetails are gone for those neurons thatare representing a face they don't haveaccess to that they don't have access toit you know so we said well the brain ismaking a guess it's making a guess aboutwhat these what this big very veryhigh-dimensional you know soup ofsignals in the world and in the bodylike what do they meanright when the brain makes a guess itstarts with the compressed lowdimensional sign it starts with thefeatures like anger or like threat or itstarts with these summaries and then ithas to infer or guess at every synapsethere's a guess that's being made aboutwhat the details are at the next levelbecause what's happening is the guess isbasically the brain going from thesereally General things to these veryspecific sensory motor patterns ithappens along the cortical sheet ithappens also down the Nur axis down thener you know from the cortex to themidbrain to the brain stem to the spinalcord you have to go from arepresentation of you know run to theactual physical movements of musclesspindles and you know angles of jointsand things like that so what you'redoing is you're going in the otherdirection you're adding detail you'reparticularizing and the brain isguessing it's guessing well if it'susing anger as the general feature wellwhich which instance of anger is it andwhat are the specifics that are going tohappen and and what are the WT andforgive me but and what are the Adaptivesteps that I might take or not takebecause um I'm quoting a lot today soforgive me but in the words of the greatsharington Nobel prize winningphysiologist the final common pathway ismovement is movement and that's and andmovement is nuanced right humans I Isuppose have among the greatest varietyof different speeds and types ofmovement I think about parkour orgymnastics think about then what like aa cheetah can do cheetah are impressivea gymnist is truly impressive in termsof the range of movements and speeds Etcin any event the ultimate choice of thenervous system has to make is whether ornot tomove which direction how fast or staystill move move back and and I just I'lljust add because I'm I'm hoping thatyou'll expand on this um it's been saidbefore that ultimately the nervoussystem is trying to make decisions aboutyum yuck or me like like am I going tomove towards something am I going tomove away from it or am I just going tostay put well that's only that's only atthe that that's a very I would say thatthose are very low dimensional featuresthose are those compressed features butthat's not the only thing the brain hasto decide that's just a misnomer wellgood that I can get out of this littlepickle that I just put myself in bysaying that I didn't say that now Iwon't quote who did because he's a veryfamous neuroscientist but he tried toreduce it all he's at Caltech it um he'snot somebody who studies emotion hestudies the visual system but he saidthat you know that that there's a thatthe the neural circuits maybe it'sbecause he studies mice are areessentially bended into um yum yuck andmeh outputs and and i' I've always likedit on the one hand cuz threes work andit's simple but rarely is the way thatwe describe things the way it actuallyworks so we would you know in instudying humans we would say well that'saffect affect that's mood or you knowit's just like is it is it um should Imove towards it is it Pleasant should Imove away from it is it unpleasant oryou know is it irrelevant basically Idon't care okay think about when you'refeeling horrible you just feel you feelyou just feel you feel bad what do youdo you don't know what you don't knowbecause you don't have a plan of actionand that's ultimately that is what thosethose compressed like summary featuresthose very low coarse features they haveto be decompressed into detailsotherwise you don't know what to do soultimately what the brain is doing isit's sampling from thepast basedon similarity to the present to plan anaction and when I say action I don'tjust mean skeletal motor action likemoving a limb it you the first actionsthat are planned are the actions ofcoordinating the heart and the lungs andyou know all of the internal actionsthat are required to support the motorthe skeletal motor movements so yourbrain is making uh is categorizing andit's making a it's it's creating acategory and it's there are optionsthere those options the motor plansbegin with should the heart beat fastershould it beat slower does bloodpressure need to go up should the youknow should the blood vessels constrictor should they dilate um should thebreathing be deeper or more shallow Imean those are the first plans that getmade and then milliseconds later thereare the skeletal motor plans and thenyour experience of the

emerge outof this system basically and andabsolutely um you described it farbetter than I could and and and anchorthat to this concept of movement likethe movement is the final common pathwith the understanding that the movementsystem and forgive me but that we havesystems in the brain and body that allowus to move that's for sure systemsplural that they run in both directionsin other words how we feel what wefeel our emotions has some bearing onthe movements that are more or lesslikely for us in a given context and ourmovements clearly can also influence theway that we feel internally well it'swell I mean so if um if we just look athow things are happening here's here'swhat the anatomy tells us that when thebrain makes a guess that guess starts asa motor plan starts as a visceral motorplan and a skeletal motor plan so heartrate changes breathing changes bloodpressure changes and potentiallyskeletal muscle movement right andliteral copyliteral copies efferent copies of thosesignals are sent to they propagate tothe sensory areas telling the braintelling those neurons this is the lasttime we made this in this context whenthis other stuff just happened the likethis temporal context right the and wemade these movements here is what we sawnext here is what we felt next here'swhat we smelled next so yeah I think ofthis so the image that Pops in my mindand we should explain to people whatefference copy is um in neuroscience andneuro Anatomy uh the connection to astructure is called an aarant with an Aand the connections out from a structureare called the eer but the way I was sayit doesn't even matter it's justbasically the point here is that in ourexperience in our in the way the brainyour brain conjures an experience okayand and that experience is that you feelsomething first you see something youfeel something you act that's not what'shappening what's happening is your brainis preparing the action first and thefeeling what and your experience comesfrom that action preparation so it's acopy it's like literally you have axonsthat are sending motor signals down thethe you know brain stem to the spinalcord and literal copies of those axonslike those axons have branches thatcollateral branches that just send axonsother places the same signal that isbeing sent to your spinal cord to movestuff in your body that same signal isbeing sent to other neurons in the brainas predictions of the sensations thatare going to happen in a second from nowa moment from now probably faster than asecond but you know in a couplemilliseconds if you move and so yes itis the case that what you feel is linkedto what you do and what you do is linkedto what you feel but not in this simplemechanistic way that thatneuroscientists and psychologists havebeen usingforever you it's not like you are youare you you're probed by a stimulus youyou see something you hear something andthen you process it and evaluate it andthen you react to it no that's notwhat's happening what's actuallyhappening under the hood is that basedon how things are right now your brainmakes a guess or some guesses and thoseguesses start as motorplans and the consequence of those motorplans are predicted Sensations and thenof course sensory signals are comingfrom the sensory surfaces and they s andhere's the really here's to me thereally the most mind-boggling thingabout this wholeexplanation if your Sensory neurons inyour sensory areas are already sothey're firing the the the the actionpotentials the spiking has changed basedon these prepared motor movements theseare sensorypredictions and you know when I givetalks and on my website I have some coolexamples of of how this works you canexperience it yourself you you knowstart to experience uh you know you hearthings that aren't there you you feelvibrations in your chest that aren'tthere because your brain is predictingit's predicting theseSensations so let's say the sensationscome the the sensory signals I shouldsay let me so the sensory signals fromthe sensory surfaces of the body make itto thebrain if you have if your neurons arealready firing in a way to anticipatethose signals those signals just confirmthe firing and then they're done theydon't make it any further into thebrain so when you're predictingwell your experience is constructedcompletely by your brain the signalsfrom the sensory surfaces are there justto confirm irmor to change the signals so if there'sthings you didn'tanticipate then those um errors ofprediction those are the signals thatare propagated and become compressed andstuff and we have a special name forthat in science we call it learning youknow Andy Clark is a philosopher whowrites a lot about prediction predictingbrain and and so on and he talks aboutnormal uh everyday experience as being acontrolledhallucination I think that's true yeah Isubscribe to that um it's a fairlyadaptive in most circumstancescontrolled hallucination but but it hasits limitations and it I mean what wewere talking about um if I could be asomewhat of a summary neuron you cantell me if my summary is too coarse umis that first of all that the neuralsystems and the Brain let's just call itthe nervous system because we're talkingabout brain and body are incrediblyDynamic there's a bunch of inputs thoseinputs gets are incredibly elaboratethey get summarized the summary preparesthe body for a certain action that's amotor commands preo commands and thensome action may or may not be taken butalready as soon as an action is taken ornot taken the whole state of the neuralsystem is different it's changed as aconsequence of just of what justhappened now of course when people hearthat and when I hear that indeed I Ifeel like wow it's a tough system tostudy because these are dynamical neuralsystems and and we have the technologyto put people in functional scanners andlook at what lights up so to speak wehave the capacity to ask people how theyfeel based on questionnaires but you canimagine that's incredibly crude so thenyou give them liyer scales of you knowrate from 1 to 10 how happy or sad youare and so you're adding some some depthand dimensionality to it but it'sincredibly crude it's nothing like realexperience and if somebody's more verballess verbal maybe they somaticize moreor less I mean an example comes to mindthat you know occasionally you learnfrom social media which often I learnfrom social media and someone once saidI don't think in thoughts I think infeels and I thought okay great you'reprobably also from Northern Californiaand I said wait Andrew stop being sojudgmental what do you mean and I askedand they said I experience emotions intheir mind first as a as a bodily Statethen the label comes much later that'snot how it works for me it feels fairlymore integrated brain and body for mebut other people started chiming in no Ithink of emotion I experience emotionsclearly as a verbal label it's all intheir head and so you start to realizethat we might all be encoding The WorldSlightly differently or very differentlyand it's changing in time so then thequestion becomes you know how what are"

wellyou're you're well you're more thanqualified to answer the question I'mabout to ask which is to me there is agreat conflict of information in thepsychology Psychiatry and let's justcall it wellness and mental health spacewhich is when we are feeling lousy likenot good let's put veilance on it justlousy I don't want in a state that wewe're having an emotion that we don'twant tohave there's an entire category ofinformation that says you need to feelyour feelings you need to feel yourfeelings you need to acknowledge thatthey're there you need to go into thefeeling maybe even full catharsis youneed to amplify the feelings until theyquote unquote leave your body after allSteve Job was into scream therapy andhelped himun his anger who knows you getthese examples he's probably the worstexample because it seemed like he wasangry a lot from what I hear but thenthere's another category of thoughtwhich is no you need to use your abilityto top down control inhibition of thecortex on Lower structures again I'mdeliberately using crude language hereto say wait you know this is an emotionemotions pass this is not real this isjust a limited set of uh Highdimensionality stuff that's beensummarized and you know what like Idon't need to feel this way I can makemyself feel differently maybe I'll gofor a run in fact I always feel betterafter I go for a run so even thisquestion as simple as should we feel ourourfeelings or should we not feel ourfeelings and of course you would hopethat this would be answeredappropriately such that people don't goharm other people or themselves but butbut assuming that they're not going toharm other people eles verbally orphysically then you really get yourselfinto a bit of a pickle like we don'tunderstand what to do withemotions ours or other people's becauseclearly we don't understand emotions perse so I would say I'm going to answeryour question and then I want to alsopick it the word the I want to pick itanassumption um because it it's come upactually a couple of times and there'ssomething super important in yourdescriptions that I just want to pullout for for the listeners because Ithink it's really important and you'redoing it very naturally but I think somepeople it would be it just Bearscommenting on so let me just deal withthe question of should we feel ourfeelings or use our words you know wesay to little kids use your words likedon't throw a tantrum right um but thenthere was also this other feeling ohjust feel it's important to feel and youdon't want to get it have it be pent upand you or use your body and like andlike hit a pillow I mean there's screamtherapy bite the pillow SC pill tear thepillow's you can p $5,000 for a weekofing this and they'll tell you you'regoing to feel better at the end so theanswer there is it's the wrong questionlike flexibility is important foreverything always right so um first ofall you don't have you don't haveemotions in your body your body doesn'tkeep the score you know yeah great booktitle because it's super catchy but withall due respect to I think the importantwork of Vander I think it oversimplifiedand led people to believe that theirback pain wastrauma and that all trauma is somatizedand it's not no it's not but I I wouldgo further and say like first of allyour body does keep the score your brainkeeps the score your body is thescorecard that's super important and hehas done really important work but hisexplanations for why things work isscientific ific Alincorrect it just is because we don'tfeel things in our bodies we everythingwe feel we feel in our brains we don'tsee in our eyes we see in our brains ofcourse we need our eyes but we don't seein our eyes just like if you you knowpinch your your hand with you know takeskin and pinch between you know two twofingers the skin you don't feel thatactually in your hand you feel it inyour brain that's the magic of the brainin a sense so what I would say is itum uh it depends on the situation andwhat your goalis um sometimes it is useful to use yourwords and sometimes it is useful to gofor arun it just depends on what your goal iswell in both those cases you're you'reuh that you gave both those examplesexcuse me you're um it's a way ofShifting off the emotion I guess whatI'm asking is well sometimes you don'twant to shift off the emotion sometimesthe mo sometimes the wisest thing to dois live in the emotion that is you knowsometimes uhdiscomfort sometimes when somethingfeels bad it doesn't mean something iswrong it just might mean that you'redoing something hard well earlier Iwrote when you talking about the thebroad categorization of emotions I Iwrote down you know simple as good whenit feels good you're like I just feelreally great but then when things feellousy that's where Nuance could bebeneficial yeah AB absolutely becausewe're because emotions are recipes forAction when you go from be feeling badto feeling angery or sad it's a recipefor action and I would also say and thisjust this is an analogy but I I sort ofI stand by it um you know uh when I wasum I had major back surgery a coupleyears ago and I know something aboutchronic pain it's not my area of studybut I know something about it becauseI've I've and reanalyze some some datasets and I've read a lot so I'm not anexpert but you know I have ideas and Ithought to myself well I just I don'twant to end up with chronic back pain sowhat I did was I made sure after I gotthrough the first couple of weeks whereI really needed oxycodone so that Icould walk you know I was up and walkingthe same day I had surgery if you couldcall it walking it sort of a euphemismfor like hobbling around on a with awalker but um I made sure that I feltthepain that is I dosed myself withdiscomfort quite deliberately because Iwanted to make sure that I'm I'm I'msorry for using you know cartisianlanguage I don't know how else to saythis I I wanted my brain to be taking inthe prediction error I wanted my brainto to feel the to to I wanted to focusattention on the changing dis you know sthe the changing discomfort over timebecause it meant that my body washealing as the discomfort got less butmy brain would never feel thatdiscomfort changing if I uh tookpainkillersand because the prediction error thethings that the brain doesn't predictare teaching signals and I think it'strue also in your life like sometimesyou want to feel it because you you wantto feel the discomfort because it'sinstructive about something andsometimes it's not and that's maybethat's not really an answer but the onlyway that you can figure that out foryourself is to do it sometimes if you'realways getting rid of discomfort younever know when it's useful and it isuseful sometimes but now I want to getto this point that I

muchbigger event than just these features ofexperience which are all features ofConsciousness which are always therethey're always there and in infact in ourculture we we pathologize people whenthey just experience their bodies asphysical Sensations and not as emotionslike we say oh that person is Somsomatizing or somatizing they're notthey should they're really they're theyshould be experiencing emotion butreally they're you know experiencing astomach ache and that's bad but that'sactually a judgment call that isprobably sometimes wrong sometimes it'sprobably better to experience a stomachache sometimes it's more productive partof being emotionally intelligent isknowing when not to construct anemotion you know like uh right before Cothe coid pandemic was announcedofficially I was in New Zealand givingtalks and mydaughter who was who was in college atthat time wasflying uh literally likeI think less than a week before thepandemic was announced she got on aplane and she flew to New Zealand tomeet me because it was spring break andI always would bring her with me onspringbreak and in that and I remember reallyvividly I was in New Zealand there wasonly one case one case of coid in NewZealand at that point and I I got on thephone to my husband and Isaid I'm experiencing a very high levelof arousal and it's it's very veryunpleasant now my husband knows me verywell and he said yeah there's a lot ofuncertainty and I said I know now hedidn't say to me well you're anxious andyou just don't really know it I becauseI wasn't anxious I was feelinguncertain and as you know or maybepeople are know that when there's a lotof uncertainty there's also a lot ofarousal because the brain is attemptingto learn and the neurom modulators thatare important for learning new thingshappen to also cause uh a subjectivesense of arousal and some they actuallyalso modulate your autonomic nervoussystem so your heart can beat faster andwhatever and our go-to explanation forwhat that is is to experience thatarousal as anxiety but I was uncertainand remember that how your brain thestory it's telling itself the categoryit's making is a plan for action wellwhat do you do in anxiety and fear youfreeze or you run away what do you do inuncertainty you forage for informationyou tolerate the discomfort and youforage for information which is what Iwas doing when I called and said whatshould we do should I meet her at theairport and turn around and come back orshould we have a vacation like I don'treally know um and you know what I endedup doing was foraging for informationfor another couple days and then made aSplit Second decision in the air when wewere flying from one Island to the otherand we just re-rooted us and we wenthome and then the borders closed liketwo days later you know but my point isthat it this is not just youknowuh psychological mumbo jumbo you cantrain yourself toexperience your heart pounding in yourchest as determination what when mydaughter this is all in how emotions aremade these examples but they're true Imean my daughter this is the this book Iwrote a couple years ago when mydaughter was 12 years old she wastesting for a black belt in karate shewas 5 feet tall not even and she wastesting against these like massivelylarge adolescent boys okay who were likea foot taller than her and her Senseiwho was a 10th degree black belt didn'tsay to her don't be afraidhe said get your butterflies flying information and I was like in raptured Iwas like oh my God this guy is totallybrilliant that is thebest you know meaning to give toarousal that changes the meaning of itwhat you do when you create an emotionis you're giving meaning to thoseaffectivefeelings and you have have morecontrol than you might think in how youdo that you can do it by changing thephysical state that gives rise to thosefeelings but you can also change it bylearning more how to make morecategories and how to make them morefluidly um so that you do somethingdifferentand the it's not that things willnecessarily feel any more unpleasant orany less or or any more pleasant it'sthatthe feeling becomes a source of wisdomit's a cue to do somethingdifferent this is a case uh where Iabsolutely believe that uh knowledgeabout how emotions and affect and statesof the brain and body work which is whatyou're beautifully describing for peopletoday is extremely useful in and ofitself and I think um and I it's afrankly it's a it's a refreshing andwelcome departure from a lot of theconversations that we normally have onthis podcast where you know we talk alot about protocols we talk about toolsright things that people can do waysthey can implement the knowledge andhere this is certainly one of thosecases as well but um it's a beautifulone and a very um important onewhere the knowledge itself just theknowledge of additional words fordifferent states uh I love the exampleexample of butter putting butterfliesinto formation because it it inherent tothat is that you're not trying to getrid of the Butterflies quite theopposite yeah um you're deploying themin certain ways and there's an actionstep and a psychological step there ofcourse that's required but that it isn'tum you know view morning sunlight for anaverage of 10 minutes to set yourcircadian rhythm which is something thatI say over and over again I'll go intothe grave saying that they'll probablyput a window over my grave so sunlightcan get in at this point but which wouldbe fine with me but in any case umknowledge is power is something that wehear but it's not always true often it'sknowledge is power but you need to do XY and Z in a certain order but here whatyou've provided and you you'recontinuing to provide is knowledge thatpeople can usethat real estate within their brain I'mdeliberately not giving it a name umbecause it's it's distributed realestate that allows them to take anunpleasant feeling and work with it umthat it has more dimensionality than we"

            "text": "probablyrealize um that's becoming clear to methat rarely if ever is there lessdimensionality um you can always give itmore dimensionality by just shiftingyour attention and you can practice thisreally so you know like there's a storythat I tell about when I the brief uhmoment when I tried to learn how topaint you know and so uh there's anobject like a cup and you have thisthree-dimensional object and you want torender it on a two-dimensional canvas soyou could just try to draw the cup andthen what you get is a pretty shittylooking you know cup um but what what arealist painter will teach you to do isto take the cup and to break it apartinto pieces of light and then what youtry to paint are the pieces of light soyou're transferring your first whatyou're doing is you're taking this verylow dimensional coarse object called acup and you're breaking it into tinylittle pieces of light which is what thevisual system does which is what thevisual system does and so what you'redoing is you're categorizing itdifferently in order to emphasize thefeatures that are more High dimensionalthat are in there right they're in therein in the brain but you can but whatyou're doing essentially is you'reyou're having the brain your brain isapplying attention to basically um focusmore on those details and then youtransfer the details on to thetwo-dimensional canvas and what you getis a pretty decent lookingthree-dimensional Cup on atwo-dimensional canvas aming un unlessyou're me and and then it still looksshitty uh you know and so maybe I'llI'll take it up again sometime uh in thefuture but my point is that you can dothat with your own sensory condition ofyour body in Emotion you candeliberately focus on what your heart isdoing to the to your the best of yourability that you can sense it right oryou can deliberately Focus on yourbreathing or you could deliberatelyfocus on what your muscles are how theyhow tense they feel you can you canchange the dimensionality of yourexperience by the shifting of yourattention I love it and uh forgive mefor giving another example but I thinkit's one that will resonate with both ofus and hopefully with our listeners aswell which is um the great Oliver Sachsneurologist and author um talked aboutand wrote about you know he'd work withthese patients that were either hadlocked in syndrome or severe autism orsevere tourettes or Parkinson's and youknow most people would even clinicianswho specialize in those areas would lookat those people and say that they'reliving in a diminished world it's it'sthey lack capacities that other peoplehave and um and it's all about the a theabsence of certain abilities and uh andthen what he did eventually wasincredible he loved animals so he wouldspend time thinking about what would belike for instance to be a bat hanging inthe corner of a room and experience theroom not through vision but mainlythrough echolocation and he would spenda lot of time thinking about that healso did a lot of drugs at one point inhis career and then stopped because theywere very destructive drugs not justpsychedelics but also methamphetamine soyes he has that but he eventuallychanged his practice to trying toexperience human emotion but first thinkabout animal sensory experience MH andand he would do that for lots ofdifferent types of animals octopus andbats and all these different things andthen it allowed him in his words itallowed him to then interact withpatients in a way where he could feelmaybe even empathize a little bit withhow they experienced life and then hewould write books about it in a way andhere I'm borrowing someone else's wordsthat storied these people into almostgreater Larger than Life characters andnow of course he wasn't trying todetract from their suffering but he wastrying to give people an understandingof what that suffering was like throughtheir actual experience and he did it inmy opinion and the opinion of many otherpeople a masterful job in doing and andit but it came through much in the sameway that your art teacher said you knowpay attention to the way the the thechanges in light across the the theobject as opposed to trying to draw drawthe object themselves that when we sothe the takeaway here that I I thinkwe're arriving at is that that you'veprovided is thatif we take a if we add dimensionality toour description of or experience of thesensory inputs and there's a ton of itto reach to and we maybe even come upwith some new internal labels orlanguage based labels that we canexperience the world in much richer andmuch more adaptive ways absolutely and II love I love your stories and I lovethis story in particular about Oliversax because um it resonates with myexperience when I was reading um Edyong's new book oh um first he wrote Wecontain multitudes which I think oneaiter and then um uh what is the recentone with animals an immense World animmense world and what I what I wasthinking was youknow it's a first of all it's amasterful masterful masterful book I Iwish I had written that book I I wrotehim a fan letter I was like this is suchan amazing book it's an amazing book umbut because he help helpsyouexperience so what what I want to say isthis that there are all these animalsthat have different sensory surfacesthan we do and they can detect signalsin the world that are that we that arenot relevant to us because we don't havesensory surfaces forthem and it reminds you first of allthat what you experience as reality isreally not in the world alone and it'snot in your head alone it is in thetrans action between the two you knowyour the neurons in your brain in inyour nervous system are also part of thereality and so reality is thetransaction reality are the are thefeatures that are the transactionbetween signals in the world and signalsin your brainand the parts of the world that someother animals experience that we willnever experience they're not really partof our reality because they don'tinteract with any of the anything thatwe have but for those animals it's partof their Niche it's part of their youknow Niche is just the word for theparts of the world that matter to youbasically and I was thinking that ifpeople read this book and you know maybeit will help them have empathy for otherpeople who don't have Minds like theirsand who don't experience the world inthe way that they do your description ofwhat what um Oliver sax his what his umhis actions were and his schools it didoccur to me that this book by Edy wouldbe a greattool for helping people to understandthat the way that they experience theworld it might be different than howother people experience the world andeven a little bit of a window on that itwould be a good thing so I'd like to askyou more about this word"

            "text": "affect and then I'd like to discuss howthings that we do or don't do might beuseful for putting us in Broadcategories of affect so that we mightexperience particular arrays of emotionsum so this is my attempt to understandaffect in an effort to think about someactionable itemsabsolutely I love the word affect theway you described it setting up apotential or a series of potentialitiesfor different emotions to occur you knowI make it a point to get sunlight in myeye in the morning to try and wake up mybrain and body because indeed it doesthat um uh broadly speaking I make aneffort to get good sleep at nightbecause that makes everything betterabsolutely and when I'm not sleepingwell or enough it makes everything worsethis is non-clinical non- nuancedlanguage but I think most people whenthey hear affect and if they think aboutthe examples I just gave kind ofunderstand like yeah like when a kid istired young kid they get cranky whenwe're sleep deprived we get crankyindeed there are times when I'm sleepdeprived and Little Things Great on methey like a splinter just feels superannoying and maybe even painful but whenI'm well rested things are going betterit's not that bad so tell tell us moreabout affect because I think it's areally important Anchor Point for us tounderstand emotions in ourselves andother peopleneuroscientiststhinkabout the sensory systems for touch andproception which we call somatasensation as being in the service ofmotor move skeletal motor movements youreally the our sense of touch and evenVision actually also works this way umand he and actually audition does toothese senses actually serve in um thebrain's ability to um control themovements of the body and the same thingistrue uh for the um regulating thesystems of the body so brains one oftheir fundamental jobs are to coordinateand um regulate the systems inside yourbody your heart your lungs your gut youknow all the moving parts and theinformation the the sensory signals thatthat those um organs and and tissues andso on send back to thebrainum as I said before those sensorysignals are important to the brain'sability to regulate the body but wedon't feel themdirectly we usually experience them asaffective feelings these very simplephysical sorts of feelings and then weelaborate them in various ways they theyreally when they get very intense thatthose are the moments when the braincreates a creates a motion out ofthemso the brain's regulation of the bodythe predictive regulation of the body isthe technical term is allostasis butwhen I'm explaining this to the public Iuse a metaphor and you know allmetaphors are wrong but some metaphorsare less wrong and useful so themetaphor that I use is um your brain isrunning a budget for your body and it'snot budgeting money it's budgetingglucose and salt and oxygen and waterand all the nutrients that you need tostay alive and well and so you can thinkabout withdrawals from that budget likeburning glucose or using up oxygen umyou can think about deposits likesleeping and eating um you can thinkabout you knowsavings um so when you're with a friendwho you trust and you know everythingyou do actually is just slightly lessmetabolically expensive right and youcan also think about taxes um like ifyou are stressed socially stressedwithin two hours of eating a meal thatsame meal will costyou aund the equivalent of 104 morecalories in the inefficiency that youwill metabolize it because of thatstress um meaning you'll burn moreenergy you'll be moreinefficient in metabolizing the food soit's as if you had eaten 104 morecalories oh so I had exactly backwardsand so over the course of a year that's11 pounds so when we say that people aretaxing on us yeah we like it's literallytrue their language Works their languageworks so the way I describe it is thatyou can think about affect as a quickand dirty summary of the state of yourbody butbudget if things are going reasonablywell then you'll feel okay you mighteven feelPleasant if you're running a deficit inyour body budget then you're going tofeel fatigued or ordistressed and that doesn't meansomething is necessarily wrong like forexample when you exercise you get to acertain point where you've reached yourventilatory load usually it's like youknow 20 minutes in or 10 minutes in orwhatever depending on how hard you'reworking and you start to feel unpleasantand fatigued but that doesn't mean thatsomething's wrong that just means thatyou're working really hard and you haveto push through it and then you knowwhen you you know drink water and youknow you eat afterwards and replenishand then you're fine right in factyou're better it's it's a a way of umbuilding a better stronger futureyou so affect is basically you know whenwhen things when you're feeling reallyworked up it probably means thatsomething's uncertainsomewhere so I just think about these aslike quick and dirty ways of thinkingabout your your what your what Youraffect means and um and then oftentimesas we've said before emotion regulationthat is controlling emotion reallyactually is not so much about changingthe meaning of affect it's changing theaffect um and um so it's useful tounderstand that affect is tied to thestate of your body or actually what it'stied to is your brain's beliefs aboutthe state of your body your brain ismodeling the state of the body andthat's interception that's the technicalword interception is not your awarenessof your body it's your brain's modelingof your body what your brain believes tobe true about the metabolic state ofyour body and that's how I think aboutaffect that's how I think about my own"

yes and I'veheard you say before that we areessentially amino acid forging machinesso I noticed you said protein you didn'tsay you need a bagel you said protein umwe could go down that rabbit hole maybemaybe we do maybe we don't but I want touse this also just as a quickopportunity to say as you're saying allthis one can immediately understand whyalcohol and drugs of abuse are both socompelling yeah right you're not feelingwell so take a you're feeling tired takea stimulant that releases dopamine andepinephrine but you're taxing youralready taxed body budget yes in a waythat then puts you in a more depletedState later or alcohol like you feellousy alcohol never did this for me butfriends I have who are recoveredalcoholics will tell me that it was likea magic Elixir it made them feel rightthat's their language but then of coursethere's a price to pay later becausethen it drops your Baseline below whereit was initially absolutely100% but I just also want to say that sois serotonin like so are so is so aressrismaybe and when I say maybe what I meanby that is if you you really have ametabolic problem like say something'swrong with your mitochondria or you'rerecovering from an illness and you knowthat or or there's just some metabolicproblem in yourbody that metabolic problem isreal if you start to feel unpleasant youwill I mean feel unpleasant it will feelyour mood will benegative if you start taking serot ifyou start taking ssris which will leavemore serotonin in the synapses your uhneurons before it's re it's taken upagain that will juice the system youwill be able to spend you'll be able tomove you'll feel like you have moreenergy for a while but your nervoussystem is is a complex system and soit's going to make adjustmentselsewhere to try to deal with thatbudgeting problem so exactly whathappens when you take drugs of abuse andwhat happens on the short term canhappen for some people with ssris on thelonger term where at first it starts towork and then it stops stops working andyou start to gain weight and you knowand your because your metabolism isslowing because your brain is attemptingto deal with that with that budgetingproblem so it really matters what theyou know what the source is it could bethat your brain believes you have abudgeting problem but there really isn'tone it could be that there really is onethese things matter to how you treat itone thing uh to um just mentioned aboutssris and I unfortunately for reasons ofconfidentiality I can't cite The Sourceon this but let me just say thatsomebody who's highly informed in the inthe landscape of of pharmaceuticaltreatments for um psychiatric challengeshas told me that there's an emergingTheory among psychiatrists is kind of acollective emerging theory that um oneof the reasons why nowadays you hearabout so-called treatment resistantdepression but you did not hear aboutso-called treatment resistant depressionprior to the Advent of ssris is thatthere's a growing body of thought in thepsychiatric community that SSR eyes mayover time as you're pointing out depletethe very neural systems that subserveenhanced mood so it's it's differentthan a drug of abuse that gives you avery acute effect like methamphetamineor cocaine or alcohol but that over timeyou may actually be pulling the veryneural circuits and neurochemicals thatwould allow for positive affect deeperand deeper into the trenches um so tospeak and so there's a growing number ofpeople who simply don't respond to thedrugs any longer or other treatmentsright so I wasn't trying to say themechanism is the same I was basicallysaying the theme is the same and I'magreeing with you what happens over theshort term with drugs of abuse happensover the longer term with for somepeople with ssris because it hasn't beenrecognized yet that the that at thebasis depression is a metabolic problemand when you have a metabolic problemlike diabetes or obesity or like uh orum heart disease it's not that thatcauses depression it's that there's acommon problem which is that somewherein this very complex system of yourmetabolism there's there there's a dragand it produces negative mood and that'show you experience it sometimes it'sgood not to turn it's productive not toturn uh that negative affect into to anemotion sometimes you know sometimes acigar is just a cigar sometimes you justneed to deal with the affec of Problemby dealing with the physical yourphysical state and that's the tricky bitis knowing when is affect telling yousomething is wrong with the world andwhen is it telling you that there'ssomething wrong with your physical statethat you need to attend to I thinkeverything to me at least starts with agood night's sleep on a consistent basisand and every psychiatric Challenge andindeed suicide itself um is seems to beassociated with and often preceded bychallenges in sleeping changes in in incircadian rhythm so I think um that'swhy to me sleep is the foundation ofmental health and physical health yepabsolutely and so when I tell peoplewhen they say well what can I do I waslike well if there's only if there'sonly one thing that you could pick Iwould say get get a good night's sleepon a regular basis if you could pick twomore I would say eat healthfully likestop eating pseudo food don't get mewrong like I love french fries I lovefrench fries they're like that's likeGod's most perfect food I mean reallybut eat healthfully like eat real foodand get exercise and if you do thosethree things I know I sound like amother and so feel free to roll youreyes at me but as a neuroscientist thoseare the actually before you start withall the you know mentalizing Jedi tricksyou could just start with this and thatwould actually take you pretty far andand um and that will resonate very wellwith our audience um the basics of sleepexercise food sunlight and socialconnection are the ones that we justanchor those five are the ones that thatwe just keep returning to over and overagain and I think people will say ohit's just simple uh motherly advice butI would I think that those five thingseven just the one thing around sleepthere's some work that's required to getthat done so it's not as simple thecategories are simple but the workthat's required to get great sleep asoften as one can on a consistent basisif you're raising kids have a careerlive in the world um there's a lot thereand so that's where I think there'sthere's a there's an elaboration of ofthings and one needs to learn to be beflexible like when you're traveling howdo you do that when you know friends arevisiting how do you do that whenweather's off and so on the therelationship piece is something I wasjust going to I was just going to say"

            "text": "I'm so glad you mentioned that I'm soglad you mentioned that because You'said before and and this was another oneof those moments I listen to you I'velistened to as many of your podcasts asI possibly can but I think it was thefirst or the second one with Lex fredmanum where you said you know we areregulating each other's nervous systemsI will never forget that and youknow I imagine that you married yourhusband for a number of differentreasons but um when people pair up withromantic partners with friends withco-workers the ideal situation is one inwhich we are not tackedwhere maybe even people and just beingaround them or just knowing that theyare in our lives provides a sort ofdeposit to yeah it's a savings itprovides a saing for sure and and Ithink that's a lot of what emotionalresonance to put kind of Pop language onit is is all about who who feels good tobe around who doesn't feel good to bearound I would say the best thing for ahuman nervous system is another humanand the worst thing for a human nervoussystemis also another human and so you reallywant to be around the people who makeyou the best the best version ofyourself that you could be and thatdoesn't mean that you always get asavings like sometimes you're sometimesyou're taking care of that person and soyou're you're absorbing some of thetheir burden right and vice versa but Iwouldsay the research on you know socialisolation and loneliness and so on showsus that that you know well along withresearch on synchrony and there's just awhole bunch of research to to suggestthat um we are the caretakers of eachother's nervous systems and it doesn'tmatter what your opinion is like itdoesn't you know it just but we justthat's how we evolved as a species andso you get todecide what kind of a person are yougoing to be you know are you going to beuh are you going to be a savings or areyou going to be a tax and in general itseems that people who decide thatthey're going to be a savingsum tend to because people gravitatetowards that and want more of that yeahand hopefully would provide that also Imean I think the reciprocity piece herefeels really really strong well that's areally interesting thing about um aboutthe synchrony work right so there's workthat if you research that if you putpeople together who don't even know eachother but if they if they like eachother and they they have a sense oftrust even after a couple of minutesthey start to synchronize their physicalsignals their heart rate starts tosynchronize their movements start to syntheir heart rate probably synchronizesbecause their breathing starts tosynchronize right and it's reallyinteresting to see what you what youtypically see is that who is pacing andwho is leading like one person is theleader and then the other person is thePacer um and I got that language fromwhen I learned hypnosis by the way andum but it switches back and forth likewho's the leader like in a in a good ina in a what would we say good like in ain an interaction that looks productiveit it's switching all the time who iswho who is pacing and who is leadingit's not that always one person is is umis in charge so to speak physiologicallyspeaking we did a series recently onMental Health with Paul kti who's a umpsychiatrist and the word narcissismcame up a few times because people havea lot of questions about that you knowand he um emphasized that narcissistsare not confident they they operate froma place of of a deficit of pleasure It'snever enough and an intense Envyalthough that's not how they present andthey're often usually not aware of itthemselves but it's what leads healthypeople to feel as if the interactionswith those people narcissists often canbe very compelling in the moment butthey feel very taxed afterwards and kindof confused by what happened and itsounds like it uh ties back to this lackof synchrony um on the positive side ofthings um it's also clear from what youjust said that when people regulate eachother's nervous systems in a way wherepeople are making little deposits andproviding savings for each other ormaybe things are just neutral that umthose nervous systems are then in aposition to like pay attention to otherthings too and and and not just try andwork out the Dynamics oh for sure oh andthat's very true at work so there'sresearch showing that um especially inthe creativity you know sectorInnovation sector of the economy thebest predictor of performance on the jobis the extent to which people feel Imean after you account for sleep and andyou know watering and sleeping andfeeding right like the that um the bestpredictor is the amount of trust thatyou have in your team and in yourmanagers because if the world ispredictable it could still be thingscould be hard even when things areunpredictable you have people you knowwho have your back and so basically whatyou're doing is you're you're um they'remaking you know deposits or savingsthey're causing Savings in each other'sbody budgets so their their resourcescan be spent on the harder things whichis you know failing and you know callhaving to pick yourself back up and tryagain which is you know partly what youdo when you're an innovator so I thinkthat there's also research to show thatin your personal life when you do randomacts of kindness for people or whenyou're kind in general you derive also abody budgeting benefit from that um youknow so for a while had a friend who umwe would meet each other for lunch oncea month and you know we would take turnspaying I mean we could both pay forourselves but we kind of got a doublehit you know he paid for me one monthand then I would pay for him one monthand then you know so we get the doublehit of uh you know being kind to someoneelse and uh you know and also they gotthe you know benefit of someone beingkind to them and I'll just say I thinkkindness is a I don't know that we haveso many conversations about that in ourculture right now but I think kindnessis very very underrated and should beyou know like when I'm when my when Ifeel like I bake bread for myneighbor who's in his 70s him and hiswife that's what I do when I you knowwhen I'm not feeling good and you knowif I I mean after I've taken care of thephysical the possible uh physical causeis I and then I feel great because he'salwaysso he's always so grateful and and thenI felt like I made his day better andthen also he helps me in other ways likewith my garden and stuff because he'sjust like a Master Gardener and so Ifeel like we have this relationshipwhere we help each other and I know itsounds really sappybut and even though all the researchbacks up what I'm saying I it doesn'tquite describe the feeling of whensomeone is just really happy because youjust gave them a little surprise andthey're you know like that's that'sthere's just some juice in that Ithink in some culture out there there'sa word for that and someone will tell usI'm sure there is I'm sure there is wellI have to say um I've thoroughly enjoyedthis conversation oh me too I I've beenlooking forward to it for a long timeand you've provided us with a reallyBroadArc but also a deep dive into not justhow emotions are made not just aboutaffect but as you mentioned earlier youknow really how the nervous system worksand I I'm certain in fact that ouraudience is taking this in and realizingthat that knowledge is incrediblypowerful the the addition of nuance bothto language and to sort ofself-reflection States um as extremelyvaluable often times when one gets intointo a conversation that has some levelof reductionism and you get into gnomenclature and things like that it canreally pull away from the the real lifeexperience of something but this isexactly the opposite what you've donefor us today is you've provided such arich array of information that addsrichness and depth to the real lifeexperience and um and that is reallyinvaluable so on behalf of myself andall the listeners and the peoplewatching this I want to say thank youfor for today's discussion thank you forthe books you've written which we'veprovided links to in the show notecaptions thanks for showing up on socialmedia despite the um the the thechallenges that exist there sometimesyou always handle yourself uh so wellthere and we'll refer people to your uhexcellent social media accounts as welland and just for all the work thatyou're doing and that your laboratoryand you're now director of variousthings and related to Ai and more andwe'll talk about this hopefully infuture episodes but uh just a reallyenormous thank you thank you thank youfor joining me for today's discussion"

    "episode_summary": "In this episode, my guest is Dr. Lisa Feldman Barrett, Ph.D., a Distinguished Professor of Psychology at Northeastern University who is a world expert in the science of emotions. She explains what emotions are and how the brain represents and integrates signals from our body and the environment around us to create our unique emotional states. We discuss the relationship between emotions and language, how our specificity of language impacts our emotional processing, the role of facial expressions in emotions, and how emotions relate to sleep, movement, nutrition and the building and reinforcement of social bonds. We also discuss actionable tools for how to regulate feelings of uncertainty and tools to better understand the emotional states of others. This episode ought to be of interest to anyone curious about the neuroscience and psychology underlying emotions and for those who seek to better understand themselves and relate to others and the world in richer, more adaptive ways.\nFor show notes, including referenced articles and additional resources, please visit hubermanlab.com.\nThank you to our sponsors\nAG1: https://drinkag1.com/huberman\nEight Sleep: https://eightsleep.com/huberman\nLevels: https://levels.link/huberman\nInsideTracker: https://insidetracker.com/huberman\nMomentous: https://livemomentous.com/huberman"
