            "text": "start off I just want to take a stepback and acknowledge something that isabsolutely remarkable about music whichisif you think about languageI could describe to you a glass I coulddescribe to you an apple I coulddescribe to you a story I could describeto you a face I could describe to youany number of different things and youcould do the same for me language isessentially infinite in the number ofthings that it can explain and the waysthat it can explain itand yet if you think about music musicprovided there are no lyrics in thatmusic can't explain how a glass isshaped it can't even tell you thatthere's a glass present in the room oron a table it can't tell you what a facelooks like it can't tell you what thatperson who owns that face did or isdoing so in some ways you might thinkwow music is fairly diminished in termsof its qualitative depth compared tolanguageand yet if you take a step back andthink about what music can do it'sastonishing and it actually overwhelmsWhat language can do what can music dowell even in the absence of any lyricsany words put to music music candescribe an emotion in fact music candescribe numerous types of emotions andthey can do it with a lot of nuance sonot just displaying for us happy or sadbut rather different degrees ofHappiness different degrees of Sadnessmusic can be used to convey a sense oflonging a sense of nostalgia a sense ofdelight a sense of awe and on and on sowhereas music can't describe nouns verywell it can beautifully describeemotionsand not only can music describe emotionswith a tremendous degree of nuance musiccan evoke emotions with a tremendousdegree of nuancenow this is spectacular and it's notonly spectacular it is important becauseas we move through today's episodeyou'll soon come to realize that it'svery likelyand indeed we have a lot of scientificevidence to support the fact that musicevolved prior to spoken languagemoreover it's very likely that singingevolved prior to spoken language andthat music singing and dance togetherevolved prior to language making musicas well as singing and dance but reallyjust music even on its own in theabsence of any lyrics or any bodilymovement as the fundamental form ofhuman communication indeed music canevoke empathy again we're talking aboutmusic in the absence of any lyrics WhenI Say music can evoke empathy I'm nottalking about the sort of empathy whereyou look at somebody and Nod andunderstand so-called cognitive empathywhich is important by the way inrelational Dynamics or emotional empathywhere you're actually feeling what theother person is feeling but of courseyou never really know what somebody elseis feeling how could you you can onlyhave a sense of what they might befeelingand you have a sense of what you'refeeling but let's be honest um as one ofour prior guests on the huberman Labpodcast Dr Carl dyseroff so aptly notedrarely do we ever understand how anyoneelse truly feels because indeed rarelydo we ever understand how we ourselvestruly feel and certainly with languageit's very hard to explain our feelingswith words in a way that can convey theway that we feel with the kind of nuancethat represents our own reality even ina state of extreme happiness or extremesadness words fall short of explaininghow we feel inside and yet as Imentioned earlier music not only candescribe emotions it can evoke emotionswithin us and in doing so it can evokeemotions that give us a sense of empathyfor the person playing the music orsimply for others in the world and musiccan do that so powerfully because notonly does music come in through our earsand we'll talk about the process of howsound is converted into what we perceiveas music in a little bit because indeedit comes in through our ears and we canhear that music of course but the nervecells the neurons in your brain as wellas the nerve cells in your bodycan become activated by music in a waythat the firing of those neuronsliterally the frequency of those neuralimpulses comes to match the frequency ofthe sounds that you're hearing in youroutside environment in other words whenyou listen to music not only is thatmusic coming into your body through yoursense organs your your hearing but yourbody itself is an instrument playingthat music from within so for instanceif you listen to a piece of music thathas a lightness to it that evokes asense in you of the Turning of theseasons from Winter to Spring andsomething that's common in certainclassical music but other forms of musicas wellwhen you hear that music indeed it'scoming in through your ears but also thefiring of the neurons in your brain andbody responding to those particularfrequencies of sound is such that yourbody itself is an instrument playingthat sense of the Turning of the seasonsfrom Winter to Spring within you whichis why your body starts to feel liftedin some cases or it starts to feel alightness in some cases and an entireset of emotions starts to be recruitedthat at least for you resemble theTurning of the seasons from Winter tospring now that may sound rather complexbut we're going to break that processdown into its component parts but what Iessentially just said is that when youlisten to music not only are you hearingthat music but your body that is yourneurons and indeed your hormones as wellthings like oxytocin and some otherhormones in your brain and body thatwe'll discuss are contributing to asymphony of emotion from within yourbody and brain okay so while music can'texplain objects it can't describe them"

            "text": "it can explain in a very nuanced waysemotions and it can evoke emotionswithin us now if that's not amazingenough music can not only describe andevoke emotions it can also imply intentthink for instance about drumming thatyou would hear off in the distance andwe're not talking aboutwe're talking drumming of this sortand perhaps the Cadence of that drummingchanges such that as it's approaching itgets more and more frequentwhat is the intent being implied well weknow from numerous studies and you knowfrom numerous movies that you've seenand heard that that sort of lowfrequency drumming of increasing Cadenceas it approaches is implying the intentof aggression or Waror at least is implying that somethingserious is going to happen now contrastthat with a different frequency of soundplayed at a higher case donenowthe second set of tonesare far less clear in terms of what theymean what their intent is but if wecontrast them with let's just call themwhat they're typically called the wardrums or the drums that that convey asense of aggressive intentwhat we create then is a juxtapositionof two different emotional states in youperhaps or maybe you don't respond tothose with any robust emotional shiftbut we are conveying two separate ordistinct sets of intentnow of course spoken language can conveyintent I could say for instance you knowI'm going to help you how can I help youtoday or I could say I'm gonna hurt youright of course with spoken language youcould do that and you could change theintonation of that language you changethe frequency so if I were to say I'mgoing to hurt you it's very differentthan if I say I'm gonna hurt you okay orif I put it as a question I'm gonna hurtyou okay so with language of coursethere's also the opportunity for a lotof nuance depending on where theinflections where the accents are on aparticular phrase even a particular wordbut with music as you recallwhen we convey a sense of intent we arealso conveying that sense of intentthrough the body of The Listener notjust bringing it in through their earsand so when we do that what we do is westart to recruit a huge number of neuralcircuits that are involved not just inunderstanding or a sense of empathy foran emotion but rather that can recruitmovement or what we call pre-motorcircuits in the body pre-motor circuitsare the neurons that start to firebefore a particular pattern of action isgenerated and so when we hear music thatconveys emotion that evokes emotion andespecially when we hear music thatconveys a sense of intent from theoutside we too start to feel as if weneed to move or respond to that music ina particular way now what I justdescribed to you is not something that'slearned in fact it is innate how do weknow that well there are some beautifulstudies that have explored how babiesrespond to music indeed how babiesrespond to specific types of musicspecific frequencies of sound spacingbetween particular notes and on and onit's been demonstrated for instance thatbabies as young as three months oldrespond to music very differently thanthey respond to just other forms ofsound scrambled in time now of coursebabies that are three months old aren'tspeaking so you could ask them does thatsound like music how does it make youfeel Etc they're not going to answer atleast not with any coherence becausethey don't have spoken language yet butdespite their absence of language weknow that babies as young as threemonths old respond to music because theydo so with rhythmic movements of theirbodily Limbs and actually their torso aswell now a little bit later we willtouch on this issue of what types ofmusic evoke movement of the Torso versusmovement of the limbs versus movement ofthe Torso and limbs no I'm not going todance for you during this podcasthowever there's a really interestingstory there that relates to howprimitive or evolved the motor neuronsthe neurons that actually move themusculature are and how primitive orevolved the music that one listens to isbut just to give you a sense of wherethat's headedin this study where they examined theresponses of very young babies to musicwhat they found is that certainfrequencies of sound evoked movements inthose babies that were rhythmic where itwas mostly their torso moving back andforth and maybe their head a little bitwhereas other patterns of sounddifferent frequencies in differentArrangementsevoked movement of their limbs more thantheir torso and still other patterns ofsounds evoked movement of their torsoLimbs and head in other words babiesdancing and if you've ever been to awedding or a party or been out dancingyou will see people who include moretorso versus limb versus limb and torsomovement when they dance and yes ofcourse some of this relates toProficiency in dancing Comfort on theDance FloorEtc but there are some Universal rulesout there about how certain frequenciesand patterns of sound AKA musicevokes different types of bodilymovements so starting from a very youngage prior to any instruction in terms ofhow to danceor what music is babies are dancing tomusic and that highlights an importantpoint that we will return to again andagain throughout today's episode whichis that the systems of the brain thatrespond specifically to movement notjust sound but specifically to musicalsounds are intimately tied to the neuralcircuits of the body that generatemovement and this is especiallyimportant to understand when we get intoour discussion about music and our senseof motivation okay so the list ofincredible things that music can evoke"

            "text": "within us by way of how it activates ournervous system and body is starting togrow we've talked about how music canconvey emotion how music can evokeemotion and how music can convey a senseof intent as well now as how music cangenerate action within us this is apretty spectacular list if you thinkabout itin additionmusic causes changes within our bodilyphysiology that extends beyond thenervous system although it has arelationship to the nervous systemin particular there's been a lot ofstudies that have explored how musicchanges things like our blood pressureor how fast our heart is beating ourso-called resting heart rateand here we've made some importantdiscoveries in recent years and when Isay we I don't mean my laboratory I meanLaboratories that focus on therelationship between music and ourbodily physiology because we've longknown that music can change variousHealth metrics there are some reallynice studies and I'll link to one or twoof the meta-analyzes of these studies inthe show note captions that have showedthat if people listen to anywhere from10 to 30 minutes of Music per day and bythe way the selection of Music in thesestudies ranged everything from Rock andRoll to classical music to country musictypically these studies would asksubjects what their favorite music isand then they would have them listen tothat particular genre of music foranywhere from 10 to 30 minutes per dayand if you look at the meta-analyzes ofthose studies what you find is thatalmost all of them see some sort ofsignificant effect that is somestatistically significant shift in thebodily physiology of people thatdeliberately listen to music for 10 to30 minutes per daynot while doing anything else but justlistening to that music they find forinstance that their resting heart rateis reduced if not during the period inwhich you're listening to the music thenafter the time in which they'relistening to the music they find thattheir so-called heart rate variabilitytends to increase for those of you thataren't familiar with heart ratevariability having increased heart ratevariability is a good thing and that'sbecause heart rate variability reflectsthe sort of push and pull or the balancerather of the activation of a so-calledsympathetic nervous system which is theone sometimes called the fight or flightsystem although I don't really like thatnomenclature the sympathetic nervoussystem by the way is not about emotionalsympathy it's what drives your heartrate higher it tends to put us intoactivated states where we favor movementand motion and makes us alert whereasthe parasympathetic aspect of ournervous system is the portion of ourautonomic nervous system sometimescalled the rest and digest system theparasympathetic nervous system Drivestates of deeper relaxation of calm inany event heart rate variabilityreflects a periodic breaking a slowingdown of heart rate and breathing andother aspects of our neural systemfunction thatWorks alongside with sympatheticactivation think of sympatheticactivation as an acceleratorparasympathetic activation is a breakand when heart rate variability ishigher it reflects the fact that ourparasympathetic nervous system isperiodically engaging it's gettingactivated and slowing our heart rateslowing our breathing down music seemsto have the effect of activating thatparasympathetic aspect of our nervoussystem and so we are pumping the breakevery once in a while slowing down ourheart rate slowing down our breathing inother words when people listen to musicfor a dedicated period of time each dayof about 10 to 30 minutes some studieslooked at as much as 60 minutes buttypically 10 to 30 minutes what onefinds is that heart rate variabilityincreases not just during the periodwhen they're listening to the music thisis very important but also heart ratevariabilities increased Around the Clockin those subjects even during sleepmaking listening to 10 to 30 minutes ofyour favorite music each day not justwhat I would think to be a enjoyableprotocol if you could even call it aprotocol it's so enjoyable to listen toyour favorite music that it feels almostinappropriate to call it a protocolbecause protocol sounds kind of rigidlike you're imposing that on yourselfbut if you need an excuse to listen toyour favorite music for 10 to 30 maybe60 minutes per day and just attending tothat music not while doing anything elsewhich is what these studies had subjectsdo well indeed that's been shown toincrease heart rate variability Aroundthe Clock which we know is beneficialfor your mental and physical health moregenerally okay so there are dozens ifnot hundreds of studies that haveexplored how music impacts ourphysiology and as I just mentioned itseems that if we listen to music that welike for 10 to 30 maybe 60 minutes a dayour physiology certain Health metricsheart rate variability in particularimprove now in light of the positiveeffects of listening to music on one'sHealth there's a recent meta-analysisthat I found particularly interestingthe title of this meta-analysis iseffects of Music on the cardiovascularsystem and it was published in Trends incardiovascular medicine now from thetitle of this paper for effects of Musicon the cardiovascular system you mightthink that it's just yet anothermeta-analysis exploring how musicimpacts heart rate variability andthings of that sort but what'sinteresting about this study is that itidentifies that the way in whichlistening to one's favorite musicpositively impacts the cardiovascularsystem and other aspects of ourphysiology is very likely not throughdirect changes on our heart rate simplyby listening to music but rather throughchanges in our breathing and this istrue even if people were not singingalong with the music by the way now therelationship between breathing and heartrate is something that I've touched onbefore but if you haven't heard mediscuss this I'm just going to brieflytell you the relationship in two orthree sentences and then I'll explainthe mechanism also in about two to threesentences so if you have a background inbiology or even if you don't this willall be very simple and very clearwhen you deliberately inhalewith a lot of vigor or you deliberatelymake your inhale longer than younaturally would so for instance if Ibreathe in very vigorously through mynosesomething very specific happens to yourheart rateit increases whereas when youdeliberately exhalemeaning when you exhale and deliberatelymake that exhale longer or youdeliberately add Vigor to that exhaleor even a shorter deliberate morevigorous exhaleyou slow down your heart rate and that'sbecause of a phenomenon calledrespiratory sinus arrhythmia whichbecause it includes the word arrhythmiasounds like a bad thing but it'sactually a wonderful thing it has to dowith the relationship between aparticular muscle in your body calledthe diaphragm which when you inhale ourlungs fill with air our diaphragm movesdown and our heart therefore has alittle bit more space it actually getsbigger temporarily bigger but bigger andwhen it does that whatever volume ofblood is in the Heart Is Now movingthrough a larger space so it's the sameamount of blood moving through a largerspace and the nervous system registersthat as the blood moving more slowlythrough that temporarily enlarged heartand as a consequence there's a signalsent through various Stations of thenervous system to the heart to speed theheart up in other words just as I saidbefore when we inhale our heart ratespeeds upconversely when we exhale our lungsempty out some air our diaphragm movesup and as a consequence of that there'sless space for the heart and so ourheart temporarily becomes smaller andwhen that happens the volume of bloodwithin that smaller heart moves morequickly and that's detected by thenervous system which then triggers aneural signal from the parasympatheticarm of the autonomic nervous systemwhich is just fancy nerd speak for aneural signal is sent to your heartevery time you exhale to slow your heartdown so the well-established effects oflistening to your favorite musicincreasing your heart rate variabilityis not a direct interaction between thesounds coming in through your ears andchanges in your heart rate while you'relistening to the music that's actuallywhat I would have thought happened butthis more recent meta-analysis pullsapart the variables in these differentstudies it really illustrates that whenwe are listening to music We Aresubconsciously most of the timessubconsciously changing our patterns ofbreathing we are inhaling inanticipation of certain things happeningin the music we're exhaling when we feela relief of tension we get excited wemay get sad we may get happy we may evenjust be listening to music that we don'tthink is impacting our physiology atsuch a core level but indeed it is musicis able to Route into our nervous systemat levels below our conscious awarenessand literally turn the various knobs ifyou will of our cardiovascular system ofour breathing apparatus the diaphragmthe lungs it can evoke respiratory sinusarrhythmia which again sounds like aterrible thing but is actually thereflection of a healthy nervous systemin heart and in doing so yes itincreases heart rate variabilitysomething that is beneficial to all ofus but it's doing so by changing ourpatterns of breathing so if you've everwondered why music can change how youfeel so robustly well it's doing that ata deep foundational level of yournervous system indeed at the levels ofyour your nervous system that typicallyare not in your conscious awarenessbecause I have to imagine that most ofyou are probably not listening to musicand thinking oh here comes that onechorus or here comes that one Melody andthis is where I always exhale or this iswhere I always hold my breath this sortof thing no most people are justlistening to music it's coming inthrough their ears they're experiencingsome bodily Sensations maybe they'removing their torso arms maybe arms andtorso maybe you're not moving at all nodancing maybe just listening within yourhead or maybe it's just dropped into thebackground below your consciousawareness at all and yet that music iscommunicating emotion it's evokingemotion it's communicating intent it'sactivating those pre-motor circuits thatwould have you move if it could andwe'll talk about dance a little bitlater but even if you're not dancingeven if you're not swaying the tiniestbit your patterns of breathing arechanging and through respiratory sinusarrhythmia your heart rate is changingand through changes in your heart rateyour heart rate variability isincreasing so if ever you want wanted atooler protocol that was easy to use butcould positively impact your mental andphysical health well listening to yourfavorite music for 10 to 30 maybe 60minutes maybe more per day is thatprotocol as many of you know I've beentaking ag-1 daily since 2012. so I'm"

            "text": "is at evoking different physiologicalresponses within you that is within yourbrain and body but there's an additionalone that I find particularly interestingbecause it addresses and indeed answersone of the most common questions that Ireceive all the time which is how can Iget more motivated not how I Andrew canget more motivated although of course Iask myself that question from time totime although admittedly most of thetime I'm wondering how I'm just going toget everything I need to get done donebutI often get the question how can I feelmore motivated or what can I do tosustain my motivation over time and youknow we hear a lot of differentstrategies about how to do that we hearabout the quote unquote just do itstrategy the incredible slogan that Nikecreated and that persists to this dayhas become commonplace in culture andindeed the just do it form of advice canbe a good one but for a lot of peopleuh just hearing just do it or tellingthemselves just do it is not somethingthat can evoke action in them uh otherpeople will listen to motivationalspeeches they'll look at motivationalvideos they'll read motivational booksum they may even hire coaches in otherwords people invest a ton of time energyand money into trying to be moremotivated and indeed a number ofepisodes of The huberman Lab podcasthave focused on the relationship betweensay motivation drive and theneuromodulator dopamine we have severalepisodes about that as well as a toolkitall of which are available zero cost athubermanlab.com you can access thoseeasily by putting motivation into thesearch function at hubermanlab.com allof that will come up time stamped Etcbut perhaps surprisingly today'sconversation about music offers us aparticularly potent tool to increasemotivation and that's because one of thefundamental properties of listening tomusic is that it evokes activation ofthese pre-motor and motor circuitswithin our brain and body that is theneural circuits whose specific job is tomobilize our body from its currentposition and state to a new position instateso for those of you that listen to musicwhile you work out or prior to when youwork out you are definitely on tosomething for those of you that don'tthat's fine too what I'm going todescribe now are the specific sets ofneural circuits that listening to musicactivates as I mentioned earlierlistening to music activates so manycircuits throughout the brain and bodythat really one can take a step backfrom the scientific literature on thisand say anytime someone has done a studywhere human beings listen to music andpeople record from a particular brainarea believe it or not even from theolfactory system from the system and thebrain responsible for smell there seemsto be some significant shift in terms ofthe neural firing there or the releaseof neural chemicalswhich on the one hand might lead you toconclude that listening to music is justsort of a non-specific generalizedactivator of nervous system functionit's just kind of like turning all thelights on butthat's not the case music in fact isactivating different neural circuitsdifferently in time and space to evoke awhole set of specific reactions in yourbrain and body but not the least ofwhich is the propensity for you to moveand this is something that you canleverage and indeed I'll describe aprotocol by which you can leverage musicin order to greatly increase your stateof motivation okay so this is theportion of today's episode where we'regoing to discuss some specific neuralcircuits but I want to assure you thatif you're a neurobiologist you canunderstand this if you are not aneurobiologist in fact if you took nobiology ever in your life I'm going tomake it clear and easy for you tounderstand as I mentioned before when wehear music it activates many manycircuits throughout the brain and bodywhen I say circuits I mean neurons nervecells that communicate with one anothersort of chains of reactions when I sayrespond to one another what I mean iswhen neurons are quote unquote activatedthey release chemicals those chemicalsare called neurotransmitters things likeglutamate Gabathey're also called neuromodulatorsthings like dopamine serotonin the namesdon't really matter for sake of today'sdiscussion but what those things do isthey influence the likelihood that thenext neuron will be active or lessactive Okay so neurons speak thelanguage if you will of electricitybecause that's how they evoke release ofthese chemicals and chemistry they vomitout these chemicals those chemicals thenbind to little parking spots on the nextneuron called receptors and then thenext neuron gets activated electricallyand then to the next neuron and nextneuron and so on it's a chain ofelectrochemical reactions okay sothere's your Neuroscience 101 lesson fortodaywhen people listen to music there isheightened activation of the so-calledfrontal cortex the area of your brainwhich is on the surface below your skullbut just behind your forehead more orless and that area of your brain isinvolved in a lot of different thingsit's involved in understanding contextyou know what sorts of behaviors andthoughts and actions are appropriate fora given environment by the way if any ofyou have ever been in an environmentwhere everyone was really quiet and youthought oh my gosh what's keeping mefrom just blurting out my name right nowor saying something totallyinappropriateyour frontal cortex is the one providingthe sh the so-called top-down inhibitionon that impulse to blurt somethinginappropriate out and by the way yourthoughts about that impulse areperfectly normal they actually reflect aheightened sense of normalcyum because it means that your brain isthinking about how it's not going to dothat and so therefore you're not goingto do that likewise if you are ever atthe edge of a high bridge please stay onthe safe side of the railing but if youthink oh my goodness what's keeping mefrom just jumping off the bridge rightnow what's keeping you from doing thatis your frontal cortex it's suppressingcertain actions in a context-dependentway in particular actions that aredangerous to you socially physicallydangerous to others socially physicallyEtcnow the frontal cortex in order to dothat also has an incredible ability tomake predictions so this is the functionof the frontal cortex that I want tofocus on for the moment your frontalcortex is great at doing the if thisthen that type of analysis if I say thiseveryone will be offended or if I saythis maybe they'll laugh or if I don'tsay this I'll be safe if I do say that Iwon't be safe this kind of thingfrontal cortex is activated when welisten to music because within musicthere are some regularitiessometimes these are described as motifsor melodies or choruses again this isthe entire landscape of discussion thatwe could have and we will have with anexpert guest about how the mathematicsof Music impacts the electrochemicalsignaling within the brain and thecoding that is the mathematics of brainfunction which leads us to predict thatcertain things because they just happenare likely to happen again or not happenagain but let's set all that aside forthe moment and just State the simplefact which is that when you listen tomusic your frontal cortex increasesinactivation because it is predictingwhat you're going to hear next based onwhat you're currently hearing and whatyou heard before now I am from thegeneration that we didn't have iPods"

            "text": "when I was a kid we did have CDs we didhave tapes but you had to fast forwardor rewind a cassette tape or you had toskip on the CD in order to move aboutthe album in timenowadays you can queue up differentsongs in different order really easilybut if you are somebody who listens toalbums start to finish or if you're likeme and you grew up listening to albumsstart to finish maybe occasionallyskipping a song butyou will be very familiar with thisphenomenon which is that right is agiven song ends if you're familiar withthat album you already anticipate thestart of the next song in your head andthat just speaks to the predictivefunction that the frontal cortex playsso if you have a mixtape with a bunch ofdifferent songs sure you don't expectone song of a given artist to lead intothe next but if you're somebody who'slistened to that mixtape a lot so you'refamiliar with What song comes next or ifyou're listening to a given album startto finish and you're very familiar withit well then you'll immediately resonatewith what I'm saying here which is thatyour frontal cortex is alwaysanticipating what sound is likely tocome next and this is very importantbecause one of the key things aboutmusic and its ability to evoke our senseof surprise or Delightthrough the release of a neuromodulatorcalled dopamine we'll get to this a bitmore later is because that predictionMachinery is thinking oh I heard thatset of chords a moment ago I'm going tohear it again and then when it changesup your brain goes oh whoa hold on thatwasn't what I expected and it sometimesdoes that with a sense of delight likeoh yes and sometimes it hears that andit goes oh wait what's this I don'treally like this that much I like theopener of that song but I don't reallylike the rest I think of that as um youknow there's certain pastries muffins inparticular where I really like the topit's got the little crumbs it's got theberries and stuff and then you like getdown past the top and then you get tothe middle then you're like oh well thisthing's not that good okay there'scertain songs like that for me so Ialways thought of those as muffin songsbecause the top of the muffin is alwaysthe best whereas a donut is great thewhole way through and now I'm going on atangent because I'm thinking aboutmuffins and donuts so I'm going to takeus back to music but the point isrelevant nonetheless which is that yourfrontal cortex is making predictions andwhen those predictions are brokenthat's a sense of novelty and when thatnovelty is something that you like okayso it evokes a sense of yes I like thatwell then dopamine is deployed and whenthat novelty is something you don't liketypically there's a reduction in theamount of dopamine released in aseparate set of brain circuits belowwhatever level of dopamine happened tobe there prior your so-called Baselinelevel of dopamine okay so when youlisten to music there's a strongactivation of the prediction Machineryin your brain there's also activation ofthe circuits in your brain that registernovelty what are those circuits theseare things like the ventral tegmentalarea and the nucleus accumbens I'vetalked about these before on the podcastagain you don't need to know those namesthose are the names given to certainbrain areas that control the release ofdopamine in time according to whateveryou happen to be experiencing in thatmoment okay so the mesolympic rewardpathway could perhaps better be calledthe mesolimic reinforcement pathway sofor those of you out there shouting waitthe mesolimic pathway does a bunch ofother things it's not just dopamine Iagree it's all serotonin it's a bunch ofother things but for today's discussionwe're thinking about the mesolimicpathway as deploying dopamine which itdoes when we hear something novelmeaning not what we predicted and welike what we hear and then there are abunch of other brain centers andcircuits that listening to musicactivates I'll just list off a few againthis isn't intended to confuse anybodyor add a lot of useless nomenclature butsince I am a neuroscientist and this isa science and science informed toolspodcast I'd be remiss if I didn'tmention that we get strong activation ofa brain structure you actually have twoof them one on each side of the braincalled the amygdala this is a brain areathat's part of a larger set of circuitsthat's associated with arousal okaymeaning becoming more alert becomingmore aware of our surroundings and theparticular sensory stimuli that arecoming in at particular time such as thenotes of the music or a particular setof lyrics and music also activates areasof the brain such as the parahippocampal formation the cortex and thehippocampus itself brain areas thatencode and store memories and this issomething that I think everyone will befamiliar with when you hear certainsongs or even songs that sound likecertain songs or even songs that youswear you've never heard before it canevoke a sense of nostalgia of longingfor something of missing somebody ofsadness or of delight and happiness andpositive memories of somebody orsomething indeed I think it's fair tosay that hearing particular pieces ofmusic particular songs more than anyother experience can activate a wholelibrary of memory and emotions within usand that's because of its ability toactivate the para hippocampal regions ofthe brain the cortex and the hippocampusitself again several different brainareas all which communicate with oneanother and other areas of the brain inorder to encode our memoriesour sense of self our sense of othersour sense of history with those peopleand on and on nowrather than just make this a catalog ofdifferent brain areas that music evokeswhat I'm trying to do is spell out howmusic activating these different brainareas is creating different componentsof what we are familiar with as ourexperience of music so frontal cortexprediction mesolimbic reward pathwaynovelty amygdala a sense of emotion andarousalpara hippocampal cortex and cortex andhippocampus our memories in particularour emotional memories and our locationMemories associated with a particularpiece of music right haven't you everheard a song from let's say a summercamp that you went to when you were akid and all of a sudden you'reremembering the smell of the grasses atthat summer camp you're remembering howsome of the kids were really great andhow some of the kids were reallyobnoxious you're remembering some thingsthat you did remember your counselors Imean there's just a whole landscape ofneural information there lifeinformation stored in your head thathearing a particular song that was sungwhen you were what eight years old 10years old I can't just flips the lid onand it comes geysering out remarkablenow there are two other sets of braincircuits that are activated by music"

            "text": "that deserve specific attention anddeserve that specific attention now inthe context of discussing motivation andmusic's ability to motivate Us inparticular ways and those brain circuitsare the basal ganglia okay so this is aset of circuits within the brain they'reassociated with action initiationso-called go circuits and withholdingaction so-called no-go circuits butbasically the basal ganglia are involvedin regulating movementandthe cerebellum the cerebellum issometimes referred to as the mini brainit looks like a little mini brain in thebottom back of the human brainand some species the cerebellum is muchlarger relative to the rest of the brainbut in humans it's like this littlepiece in the back that looks like alittle mini brain like you're carrying asecond brain back there that's why Icall it mini brain cerebellum it'sinvolved in a lot of things but one ofits primary functions is to encoderhythmic timing and processing and alongwith its outputs to some deeper brainstem areas things like the vestibularand cochlear nuclei we'll talk aboutthis the parabrachial nucleus again youdon't need to know these names itmeaning the cerebellum along with thebasal ganglia creates patterns ofactivity in our brain that Cascade downto particular circuits in our bodyso these are so-called pre-motorcircuits and motor circuits thatgenerate the sense that we not only canmove but that we want to move and thatwe want to move in particular ways so ifyou internalize nothing from the lastfive minutes or so in which I've beendescribing how music impacts differentneural circuits in the brain please dotake away this important point which isthat when we listen to music we think ofthat as an auditory experience but nowyou know that it's also an emotionalexperienceandand this is a very important and when welisten to music it is programming aspecific set of motor actions that aremore likely to occur put differentlywhen we listen to music we are morelikely to move our body and not justdance not just move our torso our limbsor our Limbs and torso together inconcert with the music but rather moveour body from its current position toanother position and this is one of themost important things to understandabout music music despite being anauditory stimulus coming in through ourears evokes the activation of neuralcircuits in our brain that creates asort of inertia it creates a propensityfor Action across our entire body so nowthat you understand that listening tomusic activates lots of different braincircuits of course the circuits thatrespond to auditory stimuli so-calledprimary auditory cortex is powerfullyactivated by listening to music but alsocircuits associated with noveltyanticipation we talked about circuits inthe brain associated with memory butalso circuits in the brain that areassociated with generating movement andnot just movement that is in sync withor corresponds to the music that we'relistening to but all forms of movementbut when we listen to music that has arelatively fast Cadence and we canactually Define what that Cadence needsto be and we'll do that in a momentwhen we do that so-called pre-motorcircuitry the circuitry that's going toinitiate that kind of inertia where thatpressure for movement within the neuralcircuits that actually evoke movementare all activated so for those of youthat like to listen to music while youexercise you're familiar with the factthat listening to great songs with agreat beat with particular lyrics orthat associate you with a particulartime or place in your life can be verymotivating but there are data showingthat when people listen to music that'sfaster than about 140 to 150 beats perminute that it creates a heightenedstate of motivation in the body to moveand the way that it does that is by wayof Shifting the balance between thoseghost circuits and no go circuits of thebasal ganglia there's some other waysthat it does it as well for instancemusic can evoke the release of certainneurochemicals called the catecholaminesthese include dopamine but alsonorepinephrine and epinephrine fromcenters in the brain and body glands inthe body like the adrenal gland thatshift the body toward a predic positionof being more likely to move so if wewant to distill all this out to a simpleactionable takeawaysimply know this listening to musicrelatively faster music predisposes youto be more motivated to move and that isindependent this is what I find so coolit's independent of whether or notyou're familiar with the songindependent of whether or not the lyricsof the song are motivating lyrics ifthey are that's just going to layer ontop of the faster Cadence which is goingto predispose you to move but what'sremarkable is that just listening tothat faster Cadence Music is creating aneuronal resonance if you will a patternof neuronal firing within you that isgoing to essentially take your and hereI'm using metaphor is going to put yourstate of motivation from either back onyour heels to being flat-footed or let'ssay you're mildly motivated so I'll callthat flat-footed to being forward Centerof mass so for any of you that aresuffering from lack of motivation inparticular to exercise but believe it ornot also to do cognitive work whereyou're going to be still and you'regoing to sit down and you're going toread or learn or practice somethinglistening to music for 10 to 15 minutesprior to doing that work prior to doingthat exercise is one of the best ways toget motivated in order to engage in thatwork or engage in that exercise that'sbeen demonstrated in the data veryconclusively using a variety ofdifferent types of music and again thereare multiple mechanisms that converge tocreate that heightened state ofmotivation some of those mechanisms areneurochemical like the release of theso-called catecholamine dopaminenorepinephrine and epinephrine some ofthem are strictly neural circuit basedso activation of premotor circuitry andthose are going to combine with neuralcircuits that are going to narrow yourfield of vision this is a good thingwhenever you want to be motivatedthey're going to literally constrictyour field of vision to more of a tunneltype of vision as opposed to morepanoramic vision and that I described itas placing you into a forward Center ofmass I don't necessarily mean literallya forward Center of massunless perhaps you're exercising likerunning leaning slightly forward whatI'm talking about is using music as away to deliberately shift your state ofmind and body from one that is amotivated not motivated to moremotivated and it's a very simpleprotocol extracted from thepeer-reviewed literature you simply findsome faster music hopefully music thatyou like it would be even better if itwas music that had lyrics that you findmotivating and listening to that for 10to 15 minutes prior to engaging inwhatever that work may be physical orcognitive on the topic of cognitive work"

you're hearing inside yourhead now that's sort of a duh right youhear music in your head even if you'relistening to it from outside in the roombut when you understand that neuronsspeak the language of electrochemicalcommunication what we're talking abouthere is particular music evoking therelease of neurochemicals in your brainat a particular frequency so just thinkabout that for a second we know thatneurochemicals such as dopamineserotonin some of the so-calledendogenous opioids right these aren'topioids that people take this isn'trelated to the opioid crisis we'retalking about endogenous opioids thatare released in response to music thingslike exercise different types of socialinteractions those and other chemicalsare released according to the firing ofspecific neurons and we know that whenyou listen to music at particularfrequencies arranged in particularmotifsEtc that the neurons that release thoseneurochemicals are firing at those samefrequencies in other words that thesound is causing asound-dependent pharmacologic concertwithin your brain so that fact shouldmake it incredibly clear as to whycertain music even in the absence oflyrics can evoke certain emotionalstates certain sound frequencies aretransformed into the neural languagewithin your brain that releases certainneurochemicals that create certainemotional states of brain and body justto drill in how incredible that reallyis a little bit furtherif you see a beautiful painting or thepicture or presence of somebody's facein real life that evokes a particularlystrong positive or negative emotionyou can imagine that of course itcreates the release of certainneurochemicals or perhaps in the case ofa negative face suppresses the releaseof certain neurochemicals but we can'tsay that a particular frequency of colorsay Reds against oranges or the presenceof a rainbow evokes a sort ofrainbow-like cascade of neurochemicalswhereas with sound that's exactly what'shappening and this isn't to diminish thevalue of vision in terms of its abilityto evoke emotional states within usafter all I'm foremost a neuroscientistbut under the umbrella ofneuroscientists I started off as and Icontinue to be a vision neuroscientiststudying the visual system and itsability to evoke emotional states withinus but I have to acknowledge that theauditory system and in particular thecircuits in the brain that respond tomusic have a remarkably potent abilityto evoke these emotional states which iswhy when surveys have been done askingpeople why they listen to music theresponses that have come back generallyresemble the following statisticsapproximately 90 of people say theylisten to music to relax approximately82 percent of people self-report thatthey listen to music in order to makethemselves happyapproximately 46.5 percent of people saythat they listen to music in order toprocess particular states of emotionwe'll get back to what process means ina moment but more often than not whenthese Studies have asked specificquestions about what particular types ofemotions people are listening to inorder to process their emotions betterit is the emotion of sadnessand 32.5 percent of peoplereport that they listen to music inorder to increase their sense ofconcentration and we already talkedabout the role of Music in concentrationor its ability in some cases to inhibitconcentration a few minutes ago now youmight be asking yourself how can 90 ofpeople listen to music for one thing and82 percent of people for another thingand so on and so forth were well over100 of people ah well in this survey andother surveys like it people have theoption to give multiple reasons forlistening to music because of coursemost people have multiple reasons forlistening to musicnow with that said if we are to examinethis one particular category nearly halfof people who report listening to musicon a regular basis listen to music inorder to process their emotionswe can ask what does the scientificliterature tell us about how certaintypes of music evoke certain types ofemotions or help us process certainemotions and we'll get back to what wemean by process in a moment buta number of Studies have been done onthis there's some meta-analyzes thatConverge on some general themes what Irefer to as the center of mass of dataright when there are a lot of studies ina given area the outcomes of some ofthose studies conflict with one anothergenerally in a good meta-analysis whathappens is different studies areconsidered more powerful or lesspowerful than others depending on howmany subjects were involved thedifferent control conditions or lack ofcontrol conditions and so on and soforth this is one of the great values ofmeta-analyzesis that they don't treat all studiesequally they separate it out studiesbased on their level of rigor andthoroughness well what we can say withconfidence is that"

in school was required to pick aninstrument my parents for whateverreason clearly they didn't ask me what Iwant to do they asked me to play theviolin in school and I got the violinstarted playing the violin I took theSuzuki method lessons this is where youdon't learn to read music directly youthere's a number assignment to thedifferent notes and that's initially howyou learn I was also supposed to listento the songs while I slept this ideathat some of the music and musicallearning could be encoded during sleepan interesting topic because there'sactually some emerging evidence for thatnow but at the time as far as I knowthere were no peer-reviewed studies butnonetheless it was thought that thisworks and perhaps it does well I cantell you one thing for sure it did notwork for me because I have one photo andtruly just one from a concert that Iplayed I must have been about eight ornine years old and within this photowhat you'll notice is there's a galleryof children all with violins all ofwhom's bows are upand my bow is down that in addition tothe fact that my fly was open in thepicture and the fact that every time Iplayed the violin either by practice orwith the teacher present when we wouldgo to these once a weeksessions with a individual teacherpeople would cringe animals would cringeliterally dogs would howl such that myparentsdid not encourage me to continue playingin fact they and many others encouragedme to quit playing so I quit playing Iconfess I don't know how to play anyinstrument I've attempted a few otherinstruments in my lifetime yes I believein neuroplasticity it is a Hallmarkfeature of our brain our brain can learnthings even as adults but the point I'vetried to make here is that I am not ofthe category of kids that played aninstrumentand understands music theory or how toread music I simply don't and I realizethat those of you that are listening tothis or watching this out there areprobably in a mixed category ofproficiency all the way down to what Iwould consider my own relationship tomusic which is deficiency although Igreatly enjoy listening to music and Ido have a pretty good ability tomemorize lyricsin any eventthe reason I raise this is that thereare now dozens if not hundreds ofquality peer-reviewed studies using avariety of technical approaches thatshow that when children especiallychildren younger than eightlearn to play an instrument and evenbetter learn to play multipleinstrumentsregardless of whether or not they learnto read music that it leads to greatlyenhanced connectivity within their brainthat persists into adulthood and that itfacilitates other forms ofneuroplasticity and learning which isbasically to say that my brain verylikely does not include these enhancedcircuits which circuits am I referringto well there are a number of differentcircuits in the brain that have beenshown to expand when children learn howto play an instrument as a child eightor younger and again eight isn't astrict cut off and I always have tohighlight this forgive the tangent butwhen we say eight or younger I don'twant people with nine-year-old childrenor a 10 year old kid or even 16 year oldkid listening or even adult listening tothink oh you know the window is shut forme because when one designs a study youhave to have some thresholds who youinclude and who you don't include andsome sometimes that leads to these kindof artificial perceptions about wherethe cutoffs are but in any event it'svery clear that if you did learn aninstrument when you were young orideally even multiple instruments andeven better would be to learn multipleinstruments and how to sing along withinstrumentals especially in animprovised mannerwell your brain has expandedconnectivity on average relative tochildren that did not have thatexperience now the good news is thatlearning how to play an instrument oreven thankfully for melistening to novel forms of music musicthat you don't typically listen to for30 to 60 minutes per day and it doesn'thave to be every day in fact it can evenbe just three days a week for 30 to 60Minutes has been shown to expand brainconnectivity in ways that of courselends itself to better musicalcomprehension and even performance butlearning how to play a musicalinstrument at any age as well as singingand singing especially with others in agroup has been shown to enhance learningand the acquisition of new skillsseparate from musical learning andsinging in other words it seems thatlearning how to play an instrument andsinging are a gateway to neuroplasticityand this is again supported byneuroimaging data some of the morestriking of those data are that you knowchildren that learn how to play one tothree instruments when they were a kidor that sang in a choir or a group orthat we're taught to sing solo for thatmatter show up to 30 percent greaterconnectivity within this particulartheir brain Network that links the twohemispheres of the brain now as soon asI say two hemispheres of the brain itstarts drawing up a lot of ideas inpeople's heads mainly derived from poppsychology that you know there areleft-brained people and right brainpeopleI've touched on this before but I wantto make this abundantly clear again nowmost of what you've heard aboutso-called left-brained People Areright-brained People is complete andtotal nonsense it's myth there are somefunctions in the brain that arelateralized to the left or the righthemisphere in particular porosity theystart lilting and falling of speech andin singing is highly lateralized in thebrain other aspects of language can belateralized in the brain but really ifyou hear that certain people are moreemotional or certain people are morelogical based on right brain left brainstuff that stuff is completely falseit's complete garbage in fact it's notbased in any real solid data so when Isay that learning an instrument orlearning how to sing young or even as anadult is beneficial for increasing theconnectivity between the two sides ofthe brain what that increasedconnectivity between the two sides ofthe brain which is by the way mediatedthrough a structure called the corpuscallosumis not about enhancing one's emotionalcapacity or logical capacity it's reallyabout increasing the capacity of allbrain circuits or at least the braincircuits that are connected up directlywith the corpus callosum which includesmany brain circuits for things likecognition language learning speechmathematics a lot of people don'trealize this but a lot of musicians arealso especially Adept at mathematics andfor you musicians you're probablynodding of course right because themusic is grounded in theory that hasbasis in math and in physics somethingthat we will address in a future episodeabout harmonics Etcwhen children or adults learn how toplay a musical instrument or several orhow to sing and play musical instrumentsthat increase connectivity in the corpuscallosum is essentially providingmultiple highways of option for learningall sorts of things so it's somethingthat I highly encourage so much so thatI intend to finally finally learn how toplay an instrument I've got a particularinstrument in mind that I've wanted tolearn how to play for a very long timebut based on my prior experience withtrying to learn an instrument andbecause I like to consider myself aconsiderate person I intend to do thismore or less in isolation from peopleand indeed from animals as well and forthose of you that don't have the time orenergy or desire to learn new forms ofMusic you'll be perhaps delighted toknow that just listening to novel formsof music and in particular when youlisten to novel forms of music and youpay attention to that music not justletting it play in the background thattoo has been demonstrated to expand thebrain's capacity for neuroplasticity itsability to modify itself and make itbetter at learning other sorts of thingsboth cognitive and physical so I highlyencourage you to listen to the music youlove I certainly love to listen to themusic that I Delight in and have for somany years but there's also strongscientific support to encouragelistening to new forms of music

    "episode_summary": "In this episode, I describe how your brain and body are fundamentally wired to perceive and respond to music and how those responses can be leveraged to improve your mood, allow for processing sad emotions and enhance learning and performance. I explain the data showing how music can increase motivation for cognitive or physical work, what specific music has been shown to enhance cognitive performance, and whether silence or music is more effective in enhancing focus while studying. I also discuss how specific musical pieces can rapidly reduce anxiety, as well as certain prescription medications. I explain how listening to certain types of music can improve various health metrics (e.g., heart rate). Finally, I discuss how music helps to enhance neuroplasticity (rewiring of brain connections), thereby improving learning and memory. Whether you sing, play an instrument or enjoy listening to music, this episode provides numerous science-informed tools for using music to enhance productivity, mood, emotional states, and overall enjoyment of life.\nFor show notes, including referenced articles and additional resources, please visit hubermanlab.com.
