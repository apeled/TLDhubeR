            "text": "incredible things that you all have already done the premium channel as most of you presumably know provides support for important research and when I say important research we can Define that as research that is done on humans with humans with their consent of course that we believe stands the highest probability of leading to New Quality treatments and improvements in mental health physical health and performance so support from the premium channel that is from you has already allowed us to make several substantial gifts to various Laboratories as well as some other um some other endeavors so I'll just quickly tell you where those funds have gone and then I'll tell you something really truly exciting about where we're headed in 2024 we'll get to the questions in a moment but I think this is important to hear first of all we made a um a year-long gift and when I say year-long gift we're talking gifts that I certainly can say from my perspective as a researcher who's run a laboratory for a very long time these are the size gifts that allow researchers to do research that they otherwise would not have been able to do they pay salaries they pay uh for materials in the laboratory they pay for the sorts of things that allow signs to happen that would not otherwise happen we made a gift to Dr Aaliyah crumbs laboratory at Stanford in the department of psychology uh she studies mindset some of you may have seen the episode with Ally as she's called um Dr Crum on the hubman Lab podcast she's studying mindsets and how they affect both mental health and physical health in children and adults and that work hopefully we'll get a report back on at some point soon about how those mindsets can improve performance in school work Athletics and other areas of life so the idea here is that you supported that work through the premium channel and then that work can happen and then we can get the information about what the conclusions of that work are out into the general population meaning into the public so that people can benefit from that knowledge right away and in many cases Implement that knowledge we also made a gift to Dr sain Panda at the Suk Institute for biological study sain panda is an expert in circadian biology and intermittent fasting and the study he is using those funds for relates to intermittent fasting as a specific tool for improving mental health we also made a gift to Dr Carla shatz in at Stanford University School of Medicine she's studying how the immune system and maternal conditions and in especially infections or uh of various kinds that um pregnant women sometimes encounter or get can affect the developing fetal brain and that work also relates to stem cells I know there's a lot of excitement about stem cells nowadays so I'll give you an update on that as soon as I can we also made a substantial gift to Dr Joanna Stein glass at Columbia University School of Medicine Dr Stein glass has not yet been on the podcast but hopefully she will have time to come on the podcast at some point soon uh she's studying and developing novel treatments for eating disorders uh if you didn't see the episode on healthy and disordered eating um sadly uh anorexia nervosa is the most deadly of all the psychiatric conditions that is a great number of patients that have anorexia nervosa unfortunately go on to die of uh malnourishment and things related to malnourishment so it's a critical critical issue that's not talked about enough and frankly is not um well funded enough at the level of federal funding but um through your support there's now funding um siphoning into her laboratory and she's directing those funds directly at novel treatments based on neuroscience and habit formation for eating disorders anorexia and other Eating Disorders Dr Nolan Williams also at Stanford who does work on transcranial magnetic stimulation which is a tool to non-invasively alter neural circuits in the brain uh for purposes of relieving depression and PTSD and excitingly Dr Williams laboratory also combines TMS transcranial magnetic stimulation with psychedelic treatments um in particular ibaan but also psilocybin I know there's a lot of excitement about that and then last but certainly not least uh we also funded a chronobiology conference they were um desperate for funds uh reached out and we were delighted to provide the funds for that uh conference those funds allowed graduate students in postdocs who come from from Laboratories that couldn't afford to send those students in post talks to that conference to attend that conference and I must say from a lot of years of experience in the scientific Community the ability to attend these high quality meetings is absolutely critical for those young scientists to be able to glean important information and go back to their own Laboratories and to make novel contributions also can be the difference between a new collaboration getting sparked up or not and uh I should just mention that the the Research Laboratories that we fund were at a much higher level than the conferences but the conferences I think are also a really important um way to direct funds uh for those of you who don't know chronobiology is how the timing of light temperature and exercise and eating affect health so all things that I think uh people are interested in so uh that's it for what we covered um and what we supported in 2023 we're very proud of the support that we were able to provide thanks to your help and I am very very excited to announce that while in 2023 it was scom us the hubman Lab podcast through your premium uh Channel support that allows us to make that support and we had a matching donation dollar Ford dooll donation from the tiny Foundation heading into 2024 tiny Foundation is going to continue to do a dollar dollar a dollar Ford dooll match excuse me which is exciting and we've brought on in addition to that two other donors who are going to also do dollar for dooll donations so in other words for every dollar that the Hub lab premium channel has or raises in 2024 there will be $3 to match that so this is phenomenal and what it means is that the scom and hubman Lab podcast are now doing what's considered on University campuses as major philanthropy so very exciting um and so thank you Oho very much for your support you are making a difference in the research and I don't just say that I know anytime there's fundraisers things of that sort by the way this is not a fundraiser This Is Us saying thank you to you but it's always hard to know where those funds go and um we make sure that the whole process is very streamlined we cut the fat on the on it in every Dimension so that um the money can go to discovering new tools for mental health physical health and performance so thank you so much okay first question is "

            "text": "up carollyn a writes I am interested in studies about the anterior mid singulate cortex oh yes such an interesting structure would you please share any information regarding those thank you for all you do in the advancement of science thank you for all you do in the advancement of science Carolyn and others listening okay so the enter mid single cortex for those of you that um may not have seen the episode on Willpower and tenacity but even if you have is a region of the brain that is involved in leaning into difficult challenges of all kinds this is an area of the brain that gets larger when we Embrace effort that leads to a bit of internal anxiety but it's something that's good for us an Adaptive thing and this is an area of the brain that gets smaller when we don't engage in challenging Endeavors now we need to Define challenging Endeavors very specifically challenging Endeavors that stimulate the growth of the anterior mid singulate cortex are challenging Endeavors that we would prefer not to do we may want the end goal right so we may want the the consequence of the exercise the consequence of the learning the consequence of whatever the challenge is but that the challenge itself feels uncomfortable and here of course we want it to be uh uncomfortable but safe challenges is what is what's going to grow the inter mid singulate cortex now another thing about the inter mid singulate cortex that's important is that for people that end up being successful diet or successful um pursuit of Fitness for people that um complete a degree or finish an exam or things of that sort the intering cortex gets bigger for people that fail to do the work required to prepare so the preparation that is uh the Anor Ming lit cortex actually shows a bit of atrophy so the Anor Ming lit cortex is an anatomical and neural reflection of willpower and tenacity and I think what people get wrong over and over about the sorts of findings is that the anterior mid singit cortex is really responding to a variety of inputs as a lot of different inputs and outputs we know that based on neural circuit tracing but it absolutely responds best to things that feel like that they are indeed difficult that they are a challenge so if you're like me and you enjoy certain forms of exercise and it's just pure Bliss for you the whole way through that's not going to grow your anti mid singulate cortex however if you add a bit of let's say uh higher intensity work I like doing a long run or hike on Sundays I don't do Sprints too often at the end of that uh but if I were to do a couple Hill Sprints at the end and I really was like ah this this is rough this sucks that's actually the sort of thing that's going to stimulate the anterior mid singulate cortex the anterior mid singulate cortex since Caroline you asked about studies was actually uh discovered in cases where people were stimulating this brain area and the subjects these were people receiving neurosurgery for other reasons reported feeling like something was impending some not impending doom but there was some challenge like they were going to head into a storm something challenging was coming but the other subjective feeling that they reported was feeling like they could lean into it like they're ready for it they're ready to meet that challenge so what you're looking for when you are interested in growing your inter singulate cortex I'll tell you why that's a good thing to do is you're looking for that feeling of Leaning into challenge that friction if something's too easy or it's too delightful that's not going to contribute to your ID singulate cortex function and growth I might contribute to other things indeed it will um and life isn't all about leaning into challenge but why would you want to stimulate your anterior mid singulate cortex in this way and by the way those challenges can come from physical Endeavors it can come from language learning it come from a hard conversation that you're um you've been putting off that's hard for you to have Lord knows we all all have those aspects of Our Lives the things that we're putting off or that are hard for us or that feel difficult again keep these Endeavors safe never want to do anything that would damage your mental health or physical health but leaning into challenge in that way does seem to activate and grow the enter mid singulate cortex now the advantages of that is that there are studies excuse me showing that the so-called superagers um the superagers I don't like that name so much it should it's a bit of a misnomer they call them super agers but they really should be called super non- aers because these are people who seem to maintain healthy cognitive function much longer than most individuals their memory their IQ is remains stable into their much much later Decades of their life or even improves over time and then the correlation and again this is correlation but these are these people's interior mid singulate cortex does not atrophy and in general what the studies point to and there still needs to be more data collected on this is that these people are regularly engaging in things that are hard for them and challenging and they've embraced that challenge so lots to say about interior mid singulate cortex uh but I think uh that grabs the top contour and um I'm a big fan of trying to do something difficult at least one thing uh ideally every week um and perhaps even every day a little bit it doesn't take much uh maybe even just five minutes it's that friction that feeling oh I don't want to do this I can't do this and then continuing to practice or continuing to lean into that challenge safely of course uh that is going to grow that anid signate cortex and I just think that's amazing right we hear so much about brain atrophy and memory loss and etc etc as we get older a lot of data now about how to preserve health healthy physical function here we're really talking about how to maintain healthy cognitive function and the interent mid singulate cortex seems to be barometer of how well we are doing that Mark s asks would love to hear more about an evening routine and not just "

            "text": "morning especially when it comes to light oh I love this question I love this question because I've made a lot of changes in the last year related to this because um you know there's this guy on the internet that talks about the importance of getting morning sunlight I'm just kidding um there are several of us but um and gals but um I I suppose I've been quite vocal about the importance of getting morning sunlight as soon as possible after waking and of course of course of course unless you have powers I'm not aware of if you wake up before the sun comes out people always ask what do I do you wait till the sun comes out if it's overcast you get outside a bit longer if you want to wake up before the sun comes out turn on bright artificial lights now these days I've actually been playing around a little bit with some bright artificial lights um before I because I tend to wake up before the sun is out it's the winter months but in any case I've talked a lot about the morning routine in the early part of the day and a bit about the afternoon uh part of the day evening routine okay well I'll tell you ideal and then I'll tell you what I do um I'm always shooting for ideal but I'm human I think there's this idea on the internet um that I've seen that you know my whole life is is protocols protocol protocol protocol and indeed sometimes it looks like that and indeed sometimes it doesn't I'm human things happen um we all encounter different challenges so to answer your question directly Mark I think it's I know it's very important that if possible that you get a little splash of sunlight in your eyes in the afternoon and evening why why is that important and what we're really talking about here is not necessarily seeing a sunset at the beach although that would be great if you could do that but getting some sunlight in your eyes before the sun goes down maybe for 5 10 minutes it's not as important as the morning sunlight but it does have a great benefit and the benefit is it adjusts the sensitivity of the neurons in your retina and in your brain such that it protects you against brighter artificial lights later in the evening now it doesn't protect you completely but what it does is if normally and this is true bright light viewed for 15 seconds or more between the hours of 10: p.m and 400 a.m. I'm talking about somebody on a standard schedule not shift worker Bright Lights viewed for 15 seconds or more between the hours of 10: p.m. and 4:00 a.m. can dramatically quash melatonin levels melatonin being the hormone that's involved in feeling sleepy and falling asleep it does other things as well of course it's secreted from the pineal we know based on a really nice study publish in science reports that if you view that afternoon late afternoon evening sunlight you don't have to be too strict about the time get you know pop your sunglasses off as long as you can do that safely get some sunlight in your eyes or if you can't look directly at the Sun and by the way never stare directly at the Sun at least getting some daylight in your eyes before the sun goes down that can offset that melatonin reduction by about 50 % which is pretty impressive now you would still do well to dim the lights in the evening and and one thing that I've been playing with recently is uh using red lights so um a lot of people when they hear red lights they think oh you're talking about you know Red Light Panel which that has its uses those tend to be very bright red lights or um you know portable red light I actually use a small portable red light looks like a piece of thick piece of toast um I use that for other reasons this is not what we're talking about with evening routine with evening routine it can be beneficial and very very costeffective to get some red bulbs and put them in say the bedroom where you read before you go to sleep or in a particular room in your house you tend to spend time in in the evening makes for a nice mellow feel but it also does several other things first of all it if they're the correct red bulbs and I'll mention the ones that I've been using in a moment they uh eliminate all the blue wavelengths that tend to be stimulating for the what we call the noradrenergic system so adrenaline noradrenaline cortisol Etc indeed there's a study shows that when shift workers who have to be up at night use red lights of the type that I'm describing when they work under red light they have less of a cortisol increase than were they to work under standard fluorescent lights or even standard LED lights so number one thing would be dim the lights in the evening and at night as much as you safely can to perform whatever functions you need don't fall you know don't burn yourself at the stove you know if you have to Rite and do work as I often do you need light uh but to the extent that you can shift to Red Lights uh that can be helpful and many people many people and myself included find that you get sleepier when you do that so I might just do this for the last hour of the evening even if I'm up till 10 or 11: or if I do it earlier then I tend to get really sleepy but those red lights um you know I put have a little lamp above my bed I'll do that if I'm going to read in bed I make it much easier to fall asleep probably because of the reduced cortisol associated with eliminating the blue wavelengths and they tend to be fairly dim and um now there's one brand of red light that um you actually can that actually will work on a dimmer so this is important um I suppose you could use a red party lights or Christmas lights those could be very affordable um some people do that put kind of festive uh feel in the room other people like myself um will um use a red light that's dimmable I want to mention that what I'm about to say I don't have any Financial relationship to this company in terms of the bulbs um red light panels are different I use the ju um I use ju type but for red lights that uh for the purpose I'm talking about that would go into a standard lamp and that you Dim where has a very different purpose right the red light panels have a very different purpose than than red bulbs that you would put into a standard light fixture uh the dimmable ones um are called they you can find them as red light you just put Bon um it's a the uh technical name uh of the company is um sorry forgive me for Googling this now yeah it's a bond charge b n separate word charge um and those are dimmable and they have the prop ER wavelength so that's what I use um they're not super cheap but they're not expensive either in in comparison to most uh red light therapies or something so we're not talking about red light therapy we're talking about reducing the overall amount of blue light in your environment Etc now for many people who don't want to purchase something new and again I have no Financial relationship to bond charge so I don't glean any thing I buy them with my own money and I just have one or two of them and I dim the lights even those red lights I dim while I'm reading at night and then fall asleep if you don't want to use red lights for whatever reason then you would be wise to just dim the lights that you have and we possible to have those lights be set fairly low in your room environment now why would that be okay well first of all the cells that activate the alertness system uh in the brain through via the retina your eye um tend to look up into your environment and that makes sense because they're essentially there to view sunlight and the the presence or absence of sunlight but in addition to that think about it logically if I take a flashlight and I shine a beam on the ground or at a tree in the yard it looks very bright but you're not getting all those photons in your eyes right you're seeing it at a distance as opposed to shining the light in your eyes it's very very bright okay so when you have lights that are overhead and going into your eyes it's very different than the light being on the floor or on a Surface this gets back to something that I often get asked how could it be that viewing sunlight through a window takes 50 times longer to activate your circadian system than it does when you step outside well let's think about that when you step outside there's sunlight everywhere if you face the sun there's even more coming at you but when you're inside unless there's a beam of light coming through that window and the window is very clear or open for that matter you're not really getting the light in your eyes in the same way that if you're outside with the sunlight in your eyes right it's the same thing as like looking at a beam of light from a flashlight against a wall versus the beam of light going at your eyes okay so we talked about um dimming the lights setting them low in the room the I it's not red light therapy but changing over to Red Lights Bon charge is probably just one of many out there I've seen it done pretty nicely with just somebody um people grab red party lights go on whatever your favorite search engine sales site red lights and you could do that that's going to be better than any blue lights and then if you're going to be on your screens here's what I suggest there's a short cut function in your phone where you can triple click to switch your phone over to eliminate all the blues this is very different than just using the nighttime function very different and um I think we should probably put out a video on how to do this but what you do is you go into the accessibility function on your phone you go into to color filters and then you drag down the the blues but that's not how your phone is going to be set all day CU then you don't see anything that's in blue but you can introduce a triple click function I'll put out a clip soon on how to do that and so when I go to sleep at night or in the evening what I'll do is I'll triple click and I'll switch my phone over to uh to Red only and uh that's completely zero cost by the way it doesn't cost anything and then in the morning when I wake up it click cck click and turn on although I try and get the sunlight in my eyes before I look at my phone okay Tom M asks "

            "text": "light therapy recommendations for those that live in northern regions with limited morning light or too cold to get outside for Morning Light Dark when waking do red light therapy great question I'm going to take a sip of this bone broth because at the rate I'm speaking if I try and keep this up for an hour and a half I I might um get a little horse red light therapy is different than what I just described red light therapy is the use of red light panels can be smaller panels like the small ju that I use which is a unit it's about the size of a piece I guess they call it Texas tote toast right they Texas a thick piece of toast I don't know maybe someone knows why it's called Texas toast um I guess it's big um it's about the size of a piece of toast provides very bright red light and in between those red lights on there there tends to be near infrared light so far red so um you know to a biologist red doesn't mean as much as the wavelength of light so wavelengths in like the 650 to 800 nanometers is what we're talking about whereas blue light is down in the you know four and 500s and really like 535 to you know low sixes um you know like the rainbow right um red orange green blue um there are also larger red light panels and nowadays I also see a lot of um advertisements for red light panels you can actually lie down in red light beds here's the story red lights will often be marketed as the most powerful the most intensity the most locks most important is the proper wavelengths or are the proper wavelengths so that's why I use the ju because ju has the proper wavelengths of red and far red the distance to view a red light of that sort generally is about 18 in sometimes a little closer now sometimes people would put red light on different parts of their body I covered a bit of this in the light and health episode but red light because it's longer wavelength light can permeate through tissues to fairly substantial depth how deep depends on the tissue if you put it up against your skull is it going to get down into your brain no it's not going to get through your skull maybe a little bit if it's a very high-powered red light if you're holding a red light of that power at home something's wrong I don't that's a medical that's a medical device however ju are medical grade red light and near infrared lights and they um are quite powerful they're the right wavelengths actually that's why I prefer ju because they are um they are medical grade um they can be directed at your eyes in the morning for the purpose of there's a a study out of two studies is actually out of Glen Jeff laboratory at the University of College London showing that viewing red lights at a distance of about 18 in or so in the morning for people who are over 40 but not for people younger by the way that can offset some of the age related reductions in mitochondrial function and vision loss so I look at a red light in this ju my ju Texas toast light or I have a ju panel um at a distance of about I confess I stand about 12 to to 18 inches away and I do not force myself to look at that light I don't hold my eyelids open I allow myself to Blink so I'm comfortable truth told you could probably close your eyelids and some of that red light is going to get through your eyelids not a ton but some so no problem blinking you never ever ever want to look at any light sunlight or otherwise red light any light so bright that it's painful to look at if you have to Blink it's too bright step back if you have to Blink every once in a while that's okay but if you have to Blink in order to to close your eyes in order to protect your eyes then you're standing too close in the morning you can do red light therapy on skin you can do it on eyes will it wake your system up will it provide the kind of uh cortisol increase which by the way you want early in the day and adrenaline and dopamine increase that sunlight can provide the answer is no sunlight is unique in that way however if you live in an area of the world that's too dark or um you wake up long before you get sunlight in your eyes what can you do well you can flip on artificial lights you would do that the opposite of how I recommend in the evening you'd want to flip on overhead lights as bright as possible if you um have the disposable income and you want to invest in a 10,000 Lux Light Panel or 900 Lux Light Panel again I have no Financial relationship to these companies but um there's a light panel 900 Lux drawing tablet that I've set on my desk for a number of years recently I confess I've started um uh experimenting with some of the 10,000 Lux light panels that sit on your Des desk excuse me those are very very bright and I do use that now if I wake up really early and I'm going to do some work I'll turn that thing on and it sure wakes you up now is it as good as sunlight no it doesn't have the right color features and alternation between yellow and blue that morning sunlight has and that evening sunlight has and without doing a whole tutorial when the sun is low in the sky So-Cal low solar angle sunlight you'll notice if you take a picture with your phone provid it's not a cloudy day you'll see that there's a lot of blue yellow contrast and that's the optimal stimulus that said if it's overcast out you should still get outside because some of those W lengths are coming through even though you can't perceive the blue and the yellow so these you could get a 10,000 Lux light but if you can't afford that or you don't want to oh and by the way those you you set on your desk you turn on for 5 10 minutes while you're making coffee and things of that sort they actually recommend that you don't keep them on too much some people actually can feel a little too euphoric or maybe even get a little headache because it's a lot of blue light so that's one thing the other thing you can do is that if you can't uh uh access light of any kind just dark dark dark that's where the cold shower really can help because you get that adrenaline bump um early in the day which is good so early in the day you know provided you're not going into states of anxiety as a consequence of it getting adrenaline dopamine cortisol increases is great and then as the day goes on in the evening and night time certainly you want to taper the levels of those neurochemicals off now of course there's always going to be some cortisol there's always going to be some epinephrine there'll always be dopamine your system if you go out dancing you go to a party at night should you worry about the lights no okay I am not despite what you might presume or hear or read I am not uh the sort of person who wear sunglasses at a party although the other day I was at a party and someone was wearing sunglass I think it was for other reasons the um the that that gives the impression there was something bad going on I think they were just like looking cool by the way um and they did look cool but I don't do that and if I drive at night I don't wear I don't wear um sunglasses I do and I have been exploring the use of blue light filter glasses in the evening and those red lights in my house but for I think for most people if you get out every once in a while you go out to a late night you go out dancing you have a party with friends you know you get home dim the lights maybe use those red lights get to sleep early in the day Bright Lights ideally from sunlight bright bright bright bright bright how bright as bright as possible and as many as you uh is reasonable except to the extent that it could damage your eyes so don't be staring at any Bright Lights excessively okay I think that that pretty much summarizes it and then of course early day it's really about sunlight or light of other kinds cold water if that's your thing if that's not your thing that's fine there was no tablet that uh descended down to us telling us that we had to get into cold water each day it's an option it's all an option Dennis from Munich I love Munich haven't been there in a while but I used to go in MOX plunk Munich for a number of um times per year and I missed

Peter AA who I'm sure you all know and who I um respect tremendously also grateful to call him a close friend uh basically asserts is important for Fitness um I think if you're going to do a fitness test you know Peter's got it in mind and I generally agree you know you deadlift your body weight 10 times in the same set hang from a bar for a minute or more okay in the same set um these sorts of things I tend to be far less PE class about it frankly uh my goal is always the same I'm 48 years old I've been doing the same training program ever since I was 16 more or less I mean I've had you know you know Peaks and valleys in terms of my consistency based on other obligations and of course when I'm sick I don't train sick people stay out of gyms please nothing makes me more frustrated than people showing up to get their work out and getting everybody sick here's the deal I try to be capable that is ready for various things what the ability to go on a long hike what's a long hike 5 to 10 miles with some hills the ability to Sprint for the airplane without blowing a gasket the ability or that means hurting oneself or having a heart attack the ability to carry some heavy furniture with assistance safely or God forbid to take a trip and not damage myself and of course to have some level of agility and uh coordination so how do how does one do that so what Health Fitness metrics do I recommend checking well I'm going to do this next week because it's the end of the year but pretty much every week it's the following three cardiovascular training sessions one is long meaning an hour to 90 minutes that's going to be slow for me so this could be a weighted hike so waight vested hike or you could just put some weight in a backpack just be a hike if it's really steep or a long slow jog once a week for me it's jogging or hiking for other people cycling or swimming sometime in the middle of week I'm doing a 35 minute run so maybe five minutes of warmup and then a faster 35 minute run you could also do it on a rower you could also do it on a bike but you're really pushing up around I don't know maybe I I don't tend to measure heart rate but where it's I could not hold a conversation I'm working I'm working working I'm not sprinting but I'm working and then another time during the week a shorter workout of about 12 minutes it's going to be 3 minutes of warm-up some calisthenics a little bit of cycling on an assault bike or something of that sort assault bikes are the ones where you have the handles with the fan or it could be a rower or it could be any sprinting a hill and then doing sometimes one minute on one minute off for 12 minutes sometimes doing 20 seconds on 10 seconds off for eight rounds and it's real work it's getting the heart rate all the way up VO2 max the combination of those three three types of cardiovascular training sessions are that I'm ready to Sprint for the airplane I'm ready to take a long hike anytime I'm I can go out for a two mile run and really enjoy that if I if I need to it's a Readiness thing and I think it covers all bases am I ever going to be a marathoner or a champion sprinter with that or a Myer no but that's not my goal and it never has been I ran a cross country race in high school and we tell out story another time it was a lot of funun until I hit the second mile the other thing I do three times a week is I work out with resistance training I train my legs one day so that's calves hamstrings quads I train my torso so that's I do some pushing for my shoulders and upper chest and some dips that kind of thing some pull-ups some rowing this sort of thing and I train my neck because I'm a big believer in that for the upper spine but um don't don't go at it heavy it's just really to maintain you know uh posture and to make sure that upper upper spine is supported something that most people neglect and then one day a week I do smaller body parts like I'll do my Cal train my calves again biceps triceps I'll make sure that if they're any small body parts that happen to miss during the middle of the week because of scheduling like rear delts or something I'll do that maybe a little bit more neck work or some ab work okay those are spread out about a day apart I don't get too obsessed with the spacing between those workouts but they're not all stacked against one another so it might be in my case it's it's long run on Sunday this is just how I do it Monday tends to be off uh excuse me long run on Sunday or hike Monday is legs excuse me Monday is always legs Tuesday off Wednesday I generally would do that shorter run or the Torso work I flip-flop them depending on how my legs are feeling and the next day I do whatever I need to do either the Torso resistance training or the or the 35 minute run and then Friday is that faster clip cardio Saturday tends to be the smaller body parts biceps triceps Etc I must say these days of the week always have the ability ability to slide when we or the other so for instance if I'm traveling and I don't get back on Sunday until late I'll if I was not able to do that training while I was on the road then I will do it on Monday and then I'll just slide things around so that I finish off the week with everything done and I can get back on schedule but the way I've arranged it every body part gets hit twice once directly once indirectly and the cardiovascular training is is covers all bases why train this way well it ensures strength it ensures whatever aesthetic changes you want you can emphasize working harder in more sets perhaps for the things that you you know want to bring up certain body parts that are that are weaker you can um certainly recover because you're only training legs once a week but guess what you're you're doing them on Monday and you're sprinting on Friday so they're getting hit indirectly on Friday even if it's on the bike though that fast hard pedaling with resistance is going to make sure that your legs aren't going to atrophy you can still get butt you can still train them again on Monday again so this schedule is designed in a very specific way none of the workouts except the longer workout on Sunday that jog or Runner is longer than an hour ever it's 10 minutes of warmup and 5050 minutes of work in the gym sometimes 60 sometimes I'll truncate it to 45 or 40 if I'm really I have a bunch of things going on so this sort of schedule sounds like a lot but it's not it's actually a very small investment it's about an hour a day and not even on Tuesday which is a rest day so what are the metrics that I recommend checking well I'm a big believer that if you're sleeping well and your appetite is consistent and you're feeling generally good that's an important metric it's a very subjective metric but that's important are you sleeping well or are you waking up sore and you're not able to recover are you feeling like no matter how much sleep you get you can't feel rested these kinds of things now there could be other factors involved but that's the you know sort of a basic one the other one is how much energy and pep are you bringing to your workouts that's important and it relate to caffeine and fueling and all those sorts of things which we're not talking about right now it's far too much to talk about here but we did Cover in the foundational Fitness protocol by the way all of this is put into a PDF that's available online at hberman lab.com zeroc cost simply go to the newsletter T tab under the menu and you can scroll down um below that find the foundational Fitness protocol gets into sets and Reps and loads and all that kind of stuff completely zero cost I do take my morning resting pulse rate I know what my pulse rate ought to be if it's elevated substantially and I'm not particularly stressed about something then I might pay attention to that and back off a little bit on the intensity on things if I have a throat Tickler I'm not feeling very well I'm really careful about working out sometimes I'll do it sometimes I won't I'll make sure that isn't just some sort of like dust or allergen in the environment but if I'm feeling under the weather I'll take I'll just skip I just skipped that workout and some people go oh you you skip because you're you know I'll be honest I'm 48 been training very consistently I am fortunately knock on wood a little bit suspicious knock on wood I have avoided major injuries I've been able to train consistently and I've also don't tend to succumb to colds and flu I think about once every 18 to 24 months I've had colder flu of some sort for for many years that's been the the kind of cadence but not more frequent than that I think in part because I don't tend to push really hard when I'm sick I tend to be the guy who goes all right I'm feeling kind of under the weather should I train maybe not okay I'm going to take a hot shower and get in bed at 6 PM read and go to sleep if I wake up at 3:00 a.m. because I went to bed too early just chill in bed and read maybe fall back asleep maybe not I think taking care of oneself in that way is very beneficial and then people say well you haven't had kids well I've had kids in the house and I also know what it is to get sick because of roommates and all this stuff and working with people and working in a medical center you're always exposed to things so um I hear you loud and clear we can't avoid exposure to um infectious vectors as they're called um delightful in the form of kids but uh the reality is I try and back off when I'm not feeling well I push when I'm feeling good I'm not one to do two a day workouts and I'm very careful about not exceeding my my program I'm very careful about that that I don't go crazy I don't do two Pilates classes then go to the gym and I'm also not the guy who's complaining about his back or always being sick and I do not have you know like phenomenal genetics for with respect to Fitness you I'm small jointed or relatively have mediumsized joints you know I'm not particularly strong nor do I have particularly strong endurance you know I think I'm kind of in the middle so in terms of medical Fitness check I do blood work every six months I find that to be that has identified a few things that for me needed taken care of and I pay a lot of attention to overall feelings of well-being and I chart them frankly I on my calendar it's my are my workouts I put the level I put like L1 to 10 typically my workouts are in the six to8 out of 10 intensity I'm not measuring this by any kind of um device and if I get sick I tend to look back and say what was going on before I got sick you know um if I'm getting substantially weaker or I'm feeling uh fatigued I I I take stock of what's going on so I think um some people get the impression that I'm like hyper analytic about all things and um you know I would say Atia is much more into measuring things and I love that about him I'm more of the mindset like if I if I'm feeling good and I feel I'm like I can move my body well not too many aches and pains occas I get a little something of a little D disc bulge or something but and and then I take care of it but in general it's about being able to feel good seated feel good moving be able to have that Readiness Readiness Readiness for me that's the foundation of of health so um other uh things you get a regular eye exam I do have an appointment in Opthalmology Department do that air puff test for glaucoma there are treatments for glaucoma but you need to know if you have it a lot of people don't know if they have it it is the second leading cause of blindness worldwide second only a cataract it's very easy test you can get from optometrist or opthalmologist get that eye test your vision is so precious I mean vision is so precious so I I can't overstate that enough it's uh generally pretty inexpensive as well especially from the optomet rist and the drops work

            "text": "up in the middle of the night and can't go back to sleep oh such a good question I have three different tools that I use first of all long exhale breathing just to try and calm myself I also try and relax my face if I do this right now it's going to be funny but relaxing the face tends to relax the jaw and then I'll do a progressive body relaxation I do use the Revy re v r i app and they have a specific hypnosis for falling back asleep hypnosis is self-directed hypnosis David Spiegel who's been a guest on the podcast his voice is terrific for hypnosis even just thinking about his voice makes me want to go under typically with Revy you practice the falling asleep falling back asleep hypnosis it's only eight minutes long you practice that in the daytime and then you can use in the middle of the night if you need to that does require that you have your phone present and by the way if you're going to do that hypnosis you can select whether or not you're going to do the one where you have to interact and speak or not I like the one where you don't interact also if you sleep next to someone it won't wake them up revery is great for this purpose and and you might think hypnosis that's wacky or that's um you know Magic Carpet stuff but it's not this is uh you know hypnosis by the way is one of the few um approved Medical Treatments for various psychological psychiatric conditions we're not talking about stage hypnosis people clucking like chickens we're talking about you learning to self-direct relaxation which is a skill that you can enhance in hypnosis such as with Revy I think Revy now is a a free trial and it's available on Android and Apple and it's a nominal cost when you compare to things like supplements or sleeping pills it's a few dollars each month maybe $78 something like that someone will tell me but if you think about the cost relative to you know some other purchasable it's relatively low the other thing and this is something is completely zero cost and I can't encourage it enough is that you get into a regular practice of nonsleep deep rest nsdr or Yoga Nidra and that you do that during the daytime there's a 10-minute nsdr that I did which is available on YouTube you just put nsdr huberman it's available completely zero cost it will teach you how to self-direct your own relaxation and you can also use in the middle of the night if you wake up many people fall asleep during ndrs that's fine or yoga nras many of which are available on the internet free okay completely free Yoga Nidra is a little bit different than nsdr it is a category of non-sleep deep rest that includes intentions and things of that sort self-directed relaxation but relaxing is a skill now there are a few things that you can do to avoid waking up in the middle of the night one is try and limit the total amount of fluid that you drink in the last couple hours before sleep don't go to bed with a super Full Belly um some people find that if they take theanine which is something that is in the Sleep stack that I recommend and by the way I don't necessarily believe that everyone needs to take supplements in order to sleep I think you should get the behavioral stuff the light the exercise not drinking caffeine too late in the day avoiding alcohol ideally completely but maybe late in the day especially etc etc and if you can't get your sleep right that way then perhaps you start to rely on or enhance your sleep capabilities with supplements but they're certainly not a requirement the sleep supplement theanine which is in the so-call hubun lab sleep stack which includes magnesium 3 and8 and appenine uh and theanine theanine for some people can really create vivid dreams and then they wake up from those dreams they have a hard time falling asleep in that case I would just reduce the dosage of or eliminate the theanine some people like to use anoco 900 milligram anoco because they prefer that and it that works better or uh for them than the Sleep stack or some people even take it in addition to the Sleep stack um as long as dosages are followed there's no reason to think that any of the stuff isn't safe but of course check with your doctor before adding or removing anything from your supplement protocol or any protocol for that matter I say that to protect you not to protect me the other thing that you can do if you wake up in the middle of the night is to not look at the time now that's a little bit difficult if you're going to look at your phone but you know this is something that Folks at the Stanford Sleep Clinic taught me that people who look at the time when they wake up in the middle of the night generally have a harder time falling back asleep so that to the extent that you can refrain from doing that and certainly don't get on your phone and start scrolling social media um try nsdr try the revery app try yoganidra try some long exhale breathing all those protocols by the way include long exhale breathing and if you're taking melatonin before sleep oftentimes you'll fall asleep very readily and then wake up so if you're taking melatonin you might want to reconsider that melatonin does have its place for treatment of jet lag and things of that sort in the acute situations and not taking it too often but in general dosages are too high people take too much of it and too often in my opinion but that's just my opinion and then I would say if you wake up in the middle of the night and you simply cannot fall back asleep just remember that you can survive one night with minimal or no sleep unfortunately we've all had to deal with that if it starts becoming a chronic condition then you may want to talk to a sleep specialist but we've done multiple episodes of the hubman loud podcast the master your sleep perfect your sleep we have a sleep newsletter that you should definitely download it's zero cost again hubin lab.com newsletter go to menu newsletter and you can find that for those of you that subscribed to the premium channel I'm guessing that you're a aware of these um various uh tools but one thing we know from the Sleep Lab at Stanford is that when people are excited about their next day sometimes they wake up and that their sleep actually can be less than normal and they can function well the next day in fact there have been two studies at least that I'm aware of two studies there may be more showing that when people are given a quote unquote poor sleep score their cognitive Performance and Physical performance has diminished even if they slept really long and really well so they've lied to them in these studies conversely if people haven't slept that much and they rece receive a great sleep score they perform really well so these sleep scores while I like them I look at my eight sleep sleep score or whoop sleep score some people use aura rings and things of that sort you don't want them to drive your perception of how available you are for hard work and cognitive function it's why I tend to rely largely on subjective measures unless you were talking about things like apob or cholesterol levels you know subjectively uh guessing what your apob level is is not a good approach right or resting heart rate they're real metrics but you want to be careful about relying too heavily on um Biometrics gleaned from devices even if they're accurate don't put too much weight into them take the average see how you're doing lately if your sleep score is dropping each day by 15 20 points well then pay attention to that or your heart rate's going up or it's going down you know averages averages averages you know and so be a scientist of yourself coach Ruby writes what's the best protocol for strain "

            "text": "out for 2 three years but my left arm is weaker than my right how do I balance muscle strength between sides different weights or strategy great question well I guess you're assuming it's a lot weaker I mean I am a big believer in doing unilateral movements I can't remember last time I did a barbell curl or or a or a you know the thing they call the Easy Bar tricep extension I almost always do unilateral stuff dumbbell curls I think the real key if you want a weaker arm or limb to get stronger is that mind muscle connection you know it means presumably unless there's some sort of under underlying neurologic thing and I don't want to scare you it's always possible it seems unlikely based on the way you worri the question is that you want to make sure you're gripping the handle the weight really tightly by the way that will increase your strength and performance on a set to grip tightly there's neural reasons for that and that you're really working hard to contract the muscle and also use weights that you can control remember when you lift weights for the sake of getting stronger it's not about lifting weights you're actually using the weight as a tool to stimulate strength and hypertrophy increases so it's a tool and you don't walk around with the weight number on your body you walk around with the muscle development that you achieved and the strength that you achieved with a particular weight and no one cares what that weight is so if you're you know if you can't carry two bags of groceries up the stairs um it doesn't matter if you were able to you know carry 400 lb dumbbells through the gym right I mean that's why I think the Readiness thing is key I think we think so much about the gym as the as the end point but the gym is a place for training for the rest of life in my opinion it also happens to be fun for me but um if your left arm is weaker I would emphasize well you could perhaps do more sets certainly I would do you could do all your left arm sets first then your right arm sets if it's really substantially different you may actually want to stop training the right side as intensely for a period of time and get that left arm up there uh things like that but I like unilateral work I don't do a lot of unilateral work for my legs let me think I do leg curls no that's both legs same time I definitely try and pull with both legs same time leg extension same time uh hack squat same time glute ham same time okay yeah um just keep training it but don't overtrain it if it's really weak because you're giving it 25 sets make sure you're allowing time for it to recover and by the way I don't know um uh how I I don't recall because the question's gone now how old your but you give your body time give your body time I started training when I was 16 give your body time it takes time to train correctly and it takes time to develop a strong mind muscle connection and you don't don't rush don't run out there and start using you know uh don't get cavaliere with Pharmaceuticals or anything else just take your time enjoy your training the best advice I ever got about training um with somebody very accomplished and he said and I really internalized I like learn to and you may delete the learn to learn to enjoy training really hard or just love training hard I love training hard I love it I love it I love it so just learn that like lean into that process and enjoy it and if you and if there's certain parts that are challenging remember you're increasing the size of that medial interior mid singulate cortex last question really I was I was hoping we just keep going maybe I'll do like a 24-hour marathon of this and then we also do it as a as a study in sleep deprivation does anyone want to vote for that I've done that before I used to work 36 hour stretches when I was in graduate school no joke we would do these physiology experiments my producer here is sitting here going like don't do it but it's righta by the end of those experiments we'd be wearing tin foil on our heads and we were doing these experiments but we built a lot of resilience we used to survive on In and Out Burgers and I was like don't eat the bun because the carbs will make you sleepy and then we' we'd argue about it and we' you know we'd start to hallucinate somewhere around the 30 hour mark and my friend Kenzo he's now a professor back at uh University of Maryland so he can he can vouch for that story but gosh that was fun I I don't miss it I was in my 20s uh 30s yeah no 20s late 20s um but if people think it be maybe we do a fundraiser like to ra raise extra money for research and I'll do 24 hours of just answering questions around the clock and just see how you know see at what point I just completely and then I can also teach you guys how to do a proper all nighter because there are tools and the one of the main tools is don't trust your thinking between the hours of 2:30 a.m. and 4:00 a.m. so maybe during that time we just all meditate together all right last question until we do the 24-hour hun lab AMA Marathon do you have plans to produce more content or protocol "

    "episode_summary": "Welcome to a special edition of the 14th Ask Me Anything (AMA) episode, part of Huberman Lab Premium. This episode is a recording of a live stream AMA, originally exclusive to our Annual and Lifetime Members. We've decided to make the full-length version available to everyone, including non-members of Huberman Lab Premium.\nHuberman Lab Premium was launched for two main reasons. First, it was launched in order to raise support for the main Huberman Lab podcast \u2014 which will continue to come out every Monday at zero-cost. Second, it was launched as a means to raise funds for important scientific research. A significant portion of proceeds from the Huberman Lab Premium subscription will fund human research (not animal models) selected by Dr. Huberman, with a dollar-for-dollar match from the Tiny Foundation.\nIf you're not yet a member but enjoyed this full-length livestream AMA, we invite you to join Huberman Lab Premium. By subscribing, you'll gain access to exclusive benefits including our regular monthly full-length AMA episodes, AMA transcripts, podcast episode transcripts, early access to live events and more. Additionally, a significant portion of your membership proceeds contributes to advancing human scientific research. You can learn more about the research we were able to support in our Annual Letter 2023.\nIf you're a Huberman Lab Premium member, you can access the transcript for this AMA episode here."
