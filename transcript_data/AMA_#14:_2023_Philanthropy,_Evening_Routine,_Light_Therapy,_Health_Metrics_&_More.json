            "text": "incredible things that you all havealready done the premium channel as mostof you presumably know provides supportfor important research and when I sayimportant research we can Define that asresearch that is done on humans withhumans with their consent of course thatwe believe stands the highestprobability of leading to New Qualitytreatments and improvements in mentalhealth physical health and performanceso support from the premium channel thatis from you has already allowed us tomake several substantial gifts tovarious Laboratories as well as someother um some other endeavors so I'lljust quickly tell you where those fundshave gone and then I'll tell yousomething really truly exciting aboutwhere we're headed in2024 we'll get to the questions in amoment but I think this is important tohear first of all we made a um ayear-long gift and when I say year-longgift we're talking gifts that Icertainly can say from my perspective asa researcher who's run a laboratory fora very long time these are the sizegifts that allow researchers to doresearch that they otherwise would nothave been able to do they pay salariesthey pay uh for materials in thelaboratory they pay for the sorts ofthings that allow signs to happen thatwould not otherwise happen we made agift to Dr Aaliyah crumbs laboratory atStanford in the department of psychologyuh she studies mindset some of you mayhave seen the episode with Ally as she'scalled um Dr Crum on the hubman Labpodcast she's studying mindsets and howthey affect both mental health andphysical health in children and adultsand that work hopefully we'll get areport back on at some point soon abouthow those mindsets can improveperformance in school work Athletics andother areas of life so the idea here isthat you supported that work through thepremium channel and then that work canhappen and then we can get theinformation about what the conclusionsof that work are out into the generalpopulation meaning into the public sothat people can benefit from thatknowledge right away and in many casesImplement that knowledge we also made agift to Dr sain Panda at the SukInstitute for biological study sainpanda is an expert in circadian biologyand intermittent fasting and the studyhe is using those funds for relates tointermittent fasting as a specific toolfor improving mental health we also madea gift to Dr Carla shatz in at StanfordUniversity School of Medicine she'sstudying how the immune system andmaternal conditions and in especiallyinfections or uh of various kinds thatum pregnant women sometimes encounter orget can affect the developing fetalbrain and that work also relates to stemcells I know there's a lot of excitementabout stem cells nowadays so I'll giveyou an update on that as soon as I canwe also made a substantial gift to DrJoanna Stein glass at ColumbiaUniversity School of Medicine Dr Steinglass has not yet been on the podcastbut hopefully she will have time to comeon the podcast at some point soon uhshe's studying and developing noveltreatments for eating disorders uh ifyou didn't see the episode on healthyand disordered eating um sadly uhanorexia nervosa is the most deadly ofall the psychiatric conditions that is agreat number of patients that haveanorexia nervosa unfortunately go on todie of uh malnourishment and thingsrelated to malnourishment so it's acritical critical issue that's nottalked about enough and frankly is notum well funded enough at the level offederal funding but um through yoursupport there's now funding um siphoninginto her laboratory and she's directingthose funds directly at novel treatmentsbased on neuroscience and habitformation for eating disorders anorexiaand other Eating Disorders Dr NolanWilliams also at Stanford who does workon transcranial magnetic stimulationwhich is a tool to non-invasively alterneural circuits in the brain uh forpurposes of relieving depression andPTSD and excitingly Dr Williamslaboratory also combines TMStranscranial magnetic stimulation withpsychedelic treatments um in particularibaan but also psilocybin I know there'sa lot of excitement about that and thenlast but certainly not least uh we alsofunded a chronobiology conference theywere um desperate for funds uh reachedout and we were delighted to provide thefunds for that uh conference those fundsallowed graduate students in postdocswho come from from Laboratories thatcouldn't afford to send those studentsin post talks to that conference toattend that conference and I must sayfrom a lot of years of experience in thescientific Community the ability toattend these high quality meetings isabsolutely critical for those youngscientists to be able to glean importantinformation and go back to their ownLaboratories and to make novelcontributions also can be the differencebetween a new collaboration gettingsparked up or not and uh I should justmention that the the ResearchLaboratories that we fund were at a muchhigher level than the conferences butthe conferences I think are also areally important um way to direct fundsuh for those of you who don't knowchronobiology is how the timing of lighttemperature and exercise and eatingaffect health so all things that I thinkuh people are interested in so uh that'sit for what we covered um and what wesupported in 2023 we're very proud ofthe support that we were able to providethanks to your help and I am very veryexcited to announce that while in 2023it was scom us the hubman Lab podcastthrough your premium uh Channel supportthat allows us to make that support andwe had a matching donation dollar Forddooll donation from the tiny Foundationheading into 2024 tiny Foundation isgoing to continue to do a dollar dollara dollar Ford dooll match excuse mewhich is exciting and we've brought onin addition to that two other donors whoare going to also do dollar for doolldonations so in other words for everydollar that the Hub lab premium channelhas or raises in 2024 there will be $3to match that so this is phenomenal andwhat it means is that the scom andhubman Lab podcast are now doing what'sconsidered on University campuses asmajor philanthropy so very exciting umand so thank you Oho very much for yoursupport you are making a difference inthe research and I don't just say that Iknow anytime there's fundraisers thingsof that sort by the way this is not afundraiser This Is Us saying thank youto you but it's always hard to knowwhere those funds go and um we make surethat the whole process is verystreamlined we cut the fat on the on itin every Dimension so that um the moneycan go to discovering new tools formental health physical health andperformance so thank you so much okayfirst question is"

thank youfor all you do in the advancement ofscience thank you for all you do in theadvancement of science Carolyn andothers listening okay so the enter midsingle cortex for those of you that ummay not have seen the episode onWillpower and tenacity but even if youhave is a region of the brain that isinvolved in leaning into difficultchallenges of all kinds this is an areaof the brain that gets larger when weEmbrace effort that leads to a bit ofinternal anxiety but it's somethingthat's good for us an Adaptive thing andthis is an area of the brain that getssmaller when we don't engage inchallenging Endeavors now we need toDefine challenging Endeavors veryspecifically challenging Endeavors thatstimulate the growth of the anterior midsingulate cortex are challengingEndeavors that we would prefer not to dowe may want the end goal right so we maywant the the consequence of the exercisethe consequence of the learning theconsequence of whatever the challenge isbut that the challenge itself feelsuncomfortable and here of course we wantit to be uh uncomfortable but safechallenges is what is what's going togrow the inter mid singulate cortex nowanother thing about the inter midsingulate cortex that's important isthat for people that end up beingsuccessful diet or successful um pursuitof Fitness for people that um complete adegree or finish an exam or things ofthat sort the intering cortex getsbigger for people that fail to do thework required to prepare so thepreparation that is uh the Anor Ming litcortex actually shows a bit of atrophyso the Anor Ming lit cortex is ananatomical and neural reflection ofwillpower and tenacity and I think whatpeople get wrong over and over about thesorts of findings is that the anteriormid singit cortex is really respondingto a variety of inputs as a lot ofdifferent inputs and outputs we knowthat based on neural circuit tracing butit absolutely responds best to thingsthat feel like that they are indeeddifficult that they are a challenge soif you're like me and you enjoy certainforms of exercise and it's just pureBliss for you the whole way throughthat's not going to grow your anti midsingulate cortex however if you add abit of let's say uh higher intensitywork I like doing a long run or hike onSundays I don't do Sprints too often atthe end of that uh but if I were to do acouple Hill Sprints at the end and Ireally was like ah this this is roughthis sucks that's actually the sort ofthing that's going to stimulate theanterior mid singulate cortex theanterior mid singulate cortex sinceCaroline you asked about studies wasactually uh discovered in cases wherepeople were stimulating this brain areaand the subjects these were peoplereceiving neurosurgery for other reasonsreported feeling like something wasimpending some not impending doom butthere was somechallenge like they were going to headinto a storm something challenging wascoming but the other subjective feelingthat they reported was feeling like theycould lean into it like they're readyfor it they're ready to meet thatchallenge so what you're looking forwhen you are interested in growing yourinter singulate cortex I'll tell you whythat's a good thing to do is you'relooking for that feeling of Leaning intochallenge that friction if something'stoo easy or it's too delightful that'snot going to contribute to your IDsingulate cortex function and growth Imight contribute to other things indeedit will um and life isn't all aboutleaning into challenge but why would youwant to stimulate your anterior midsingulate cortex in this way and by theway those challenges can come fromphysical Endeavors it can come fromlanguage learning it come from a hardconversation that you're um you've beenputting off that's hard for you to haveLord knows we all all have those aspectsof Our Lives the things that we'reputting off or that are hard for us orthat feel difficult again keep theseEndeavors safe never want to do anythingthat would damage your mental health orphysical health but leaning intochallenge in that way does seem toactivate and grow the enter midsingulate cortex now the advantages ofthat is that there are studies excuse meshowing that the so-called superagers umthe superagers I don't like that name somuch it should it's a bit of a misnomerthey call them super agers but theyreally should be called super non- aersbecause these are people who seem tomaintain healthy cognitive function muchlonger than most individuals theirmemory their IQ is remains stable intotheir much much later Decades of theirlife or even improves over time and thenthe correlation and again this iscorrelation but these are these people'sinterior mid singulate cortex does notatrophy and in general what the studiespoint to and there still needs to bemore data collected on this is thatthese people are regularly engaging inthings that are hard for them andchallenging and they've embraced thatchallenge so lots to say about interiormid singulate cortex uh but I think uhthat grabs the top contour and um I'm abig fan of trying to do somethingdifficult at least one thing uh ideallyevery weekum and perhaps even every day a littlebit it doesn't take much uh maybe evenjust five minutes it's that frictionthat feeling oh I don't want to do thisI can't do this and then continuing topractice or continuing to lean into thatchallenge safely of course uh that isgoing to grow that anid signate cortexand I just think that's amazing right wehear so much about brain atrophy andmemory loss and etc etc as we get oldera lot of data now about how to preservehealth healthy physical function herewe're really talking about how tomaintain healthy cognitive function andthe interent mid singulate cortex seemsto be barometer of how well we are doingthat Mark s asks would love to hear moreabout an evening routine and not just"

            "text": "morning especially when it comes tolight oh I love this question I lovethis question because I've made a lot ofchanges in the last year related to thisbecause um you know there's this guy onthe internet that talks about theimportance of getting morning sunlightI'm just kiddingum there are several of us but um andgals but um I I suppose I've been quitevocal about the importance of gettingmorning sunlight as soon as possibleafter waking and of course of course ofcourse unless you have powers I'm notaware of if you wake up before the suncomes out people always ask what do I doyou wait till the sun comes out if it'sovercast you get outside a bit longer ifyou want to wake up before the sun comesout turn on bright artificial lights nowthese days I've actually been playingaround a little bit with some brightartificial lights um before I because Itend to wake up before the sun is outit's the winter months but in any caseI've talked a lot about the morningroutine in the early part of the day anda bit about the afternoon uh part of theday evening routine okay well I'll tellyou ideal and then I'll tell you what Ido um I'm always shooting for ideal butI'm human I think there's this idea onthe internet um that I've seen that youknow my whole life is is protocolsprotocol protocol protocol and indeedsometimes it looks like that and indeedsometimes it doesn't I'm human thingshappen um we all encounter differentchallenges so to answer your questiondirectly Mark I think it's I know it'svery important that if possible that youget a little splash of sunlight in youreyes in the afternoon and evening whywhy is that important and what we'rereally talking about here is notnecessarily seeing a sunset at the beachalthough that would be great if youcould do that but getting some sunlightin your eyes before the sun goes downmaybe for 5 10 minutes it's not asimportant as the morning sunlight but itdoes have a great benefit and thebenefit is it adjusts the sensitivity ofthe neurons in your retina and in yourbrain such that it protects you againstbrighter artificial lights later in theevening now it doesn't protect youcompletely but what it does is ifnormally and this is true bright lightviewed for 15 seconds or more betweenthe hours of 10: p.m and 400 a.m. I'mtalking about somebody on a standardschedule not shift worker Bright Lightsviewed for 15 seconds or more betweenthe hours of 10: p.m. and 4:00 a.m. candramatically quash melatonin levelsmelatonin being the hormone that'sinvolved in feeling sleepy and fallingasleep it does other things as well ofcourse it's secreted from thepineal we know based on a really nicestudy publish in science reports that ifyou view that afternoon late afternoonevening sunlight you don't have to betoo strict about the time get you knowpop your sunglasses off as long as youcan do that safely get some sunlight inyour eyes or if you can't look directlyat the Sun and by the way never staredirectly at the Sun at least gettingsome daylight in your eyes before thesun goes down that can offset thatmelatonin reduction by about 50 % whichis pretty impressive now you would stilldo well to dim the lights in the eveningand and one thing that I've been playingwith recently is uh using red lights soum a lot of people when they hear redlights they think oh you're talkingabout you know Red Light Panel whichthat has its uses those tend to be verybright red lights or um you knowportable red light I actually use asmall portable red light looks like apiece of thick piece of toast um I usethat for other reasons this is not whatwe're talking about with evening routinewith evening routine it can bebeneficial and very verycosteffective to get some red bulbs andput them in say the bedroom where youread before you go to sleep or in aparticular room in your house you tendto spend time in in the evening makesfor a nice mellow feel but it also doesseveral other things first of all it ifthey're the correct red bulbs and I'llmention the ones that I've been using ina moment they uh eliminate all the bluewavelengths that tend to be stimulatingfor the what we call the noradrenergicsystem so adrenaline noradrenalinecortisol Etc indeed there's a studyshows that when shift workers who haveto be up at night use red lights of thetype that I'm describing when they workunder red light they have less of acortisol increase than were they to workunder standard fluorescent lights oreven standard LED lights so number onething would be dim the lights in theevening and at night as much as yousafely can to perform whatever functionsyou need don't fall you know don't burnyourself at the stove you know if youhave to Rite and do work as I often doyou need light uh but to the extent thatyou can shift to Red Lights uh that canbe helpful and many people many peopleand myself included find that you getsleepier when you do that so I mightjust do this for the last hour of theevening even if I'm up till 10 or 11: orif I do it earlier then I tend to getreally sleepy but those red lights umyou know I put have a little lamp abovemy bed I'll do that if I'm going to readin bed I make it much easier to fallasleep probably because of the reducedcortisol associated with eliminating theblue wavelengths and they tend to befairly dim and um now there's one brandof red light that um you actually canthat actually will work on a dimmer sothis is important um I suppose you coulduse a red party lights or Christmaslights those could be very affordable umsome people do that put kind of festiveuh feel in the room other people likemyself um will um use a red light that'sdimmable I want to mention that what I'mabout to say I don't have any Financialrelationship to this company in terms ofthe bulbs um red light panels aredifferent I use the ju um I use ju typebut for red lights that uh for thepurpose I'm talking about that would gointo a standard lamp and that you Dimwhere has a very different purpose rightthe red light panels have a verydifferent purpose than than red bulbsthat you would put into a standard lightfixture uh the dimmable ones um arecalled they you can find them as redlight you just put Bon um it's a the uhtechnical name uh of the company is umsorry forgive me for Googling this nowyeah it's a bond charge b n separateword charge um and those are dimmableand they have the prop ER wavelength sothat's what I use um they're not supercheap but they're not expensive eitherin in comparison to most uh red lighttherapies or something so we're nottalking about red light therapy we'retalking about reducing the overallamount of blue light in your environmentEtc now for many people who don't wantto purchase something new and again Ihave no Financial relationship to bondcharge so I don't glean any thing I buythem with my own money and I just haveone or two of them and I dim the lightseven those red lights I dim while I'mreading at night and then fallasleep if you don't want to use redlights for whatever reason then youwould be wise to just dim the lightsthat you have and we possible to havethose lights be set fairly low in yourroom environment now why would that beokay well first of all the cells thatactivate the alertness system uh in thebrain through via the retina your eye umtend to look up into your environmentand that makes sense because they'reessentially there to view sunlight andthe the presence or absence of sunlightbut in addition to that think about itlogically if I take a flashlight and Ishine a beam on the ground or at a treein the yard it looks very bright butyou're not getting all those photons inyour eyes right you're seeing it at adistance as opposed to shining the lightin your eyes it's very very bright okayso when you have lights that areoverhead and going into your eyes it'svery different than the light being onthe floor or on a Surface this gets backto something that I often get asked howcould it be that viewing sunlightthrough a window takes 50 times longerto activate your circadian system thanit does when you step outside well let'sthink about that when you step outsidethere's sunlight everywhere if you facethe sun there's even more coming at youbut when you're inside unless there's abeam of light coming through that windowand the window is very clear or open forthat matter you're not really gettingthe light in your eyes in the same waythat if you're outside with the sunlightin your eyes right it's the same thingas like looking at a beam of light froma flashlight against a wall versus thebeam of light going at your eyes okay sowe talked about um dimming the lightssetting them low in the room the I it'snot red light therapy but changing overto Red Lights Bon charge is probablyjust one of many out there I've seen itdone pretty nicely with just somebody umpeople grab red party lights go onwhatever your favorite search enginesales site red lights and you could dothat that's going to be better than anyblue lights and then if you're going tobe on your screens here's what I suggestthere's a short cut function in yourphone where you can triple click toswitch your phone over to eliminate allthe blues this is very different thanjust using the nighttime function verydifferent and um I think we shouldprobably put out a video on how to dothis but what you do is you go into theaccessibility function on your phone yougo into to color filters and then youdrag down the the blues but that's nothow your phone is going to be set allday CU then you don't see anythingthat's in blue but you can introduce atriple click function I'll put out aclip soon on how to do that and so whenI go to sleep at night or in the eveningwhat I'll do is I'll triple click andI'll switch my phone over to uh to Redonly and uh that's completely zero costby the way it doesn't cost anything andthen in the morning when I wake up itclick cck click and turn on although Itry and get the sunlight in my eyesbefore I look at my phone okay Tom Masks"

greatquestion I'm going to take a sip of thisbone brothbecause at the rate I'm speaking if Itry and keep this up for an hour and ahalf I I might um get a little horse redlight therapy is different than what Ijust described red light therapy is theuse of red light panels can be smallerpanels like the small ju that I usewhich is a unit it's about the size of apiece I guess they call it Texas totetoast right they Texas a thick piece oftoast I don't know maybe someone knowswhy it's called Texas toast um I guessit's big um it's about the size of apiece of toast provides very bright redlight and in between those red lights onthere there tends to be near infraredlight so far red so um you know to abiologist red doesn't mean as much asthe wavelength of light so wavelengthsin like the 650 to 800 nanometers iswhat we're talking about whereas bluelight is down in the you know four and500s and really like 535 to you know lowsixes um you know like the rainbow rightum red orange green blueum there are also larger red lightpanels and nowadays I also see a lot ofum advertisements for red light panelsyou can actually lie down in red lightbeds here's the story red lights willoften be marketed as the most powerfulthe most intensity the most locks mostimportant is the proper wavelengths orare the proper wavelengths so that's whyI use the ju because ju has the properwavelengths of red and farred the distance to view a red light ofthat sort generally is about 18 insometimes a little closer now sometimespeople would put red light on differentparts of their body I covered a bit ofthis in the light and health episode butred light because it's longer wavelengthlight can permeate through tissues tofairly substantial depth how deepdepends on the tissue if you put it upagainst your skull is it going to getdown into your brain no it's not goingto get through your skullmaybe a little bit if it's a veryhigh-powered red light if you're holdinga red light of that power at homesomething's wrong I don't that's amedical that's a medical device howeverju are medical grade red light and nearinfrared lights and they um are quitepowerful they're the right wavelengthsactually that's why I prefer ju becausethey are um they are medical gradeum they can be directed at your eyes inthe morning for the purpose of there's aa study out of two studies is actuallyout of Glen Jeff laboratory at theUniversity of College London showingthat viewing red lights at a distance ofabout 18 in or so in the morning forpeople who are over 40 but not forpeople younger by the way that canoffset some of the age relatedreductions in mitochondrial function andvision loss so I look at a red light inthis ju my ju Texas toast light or Ihave a ju panel um at a distance ofabout I confess I stand about 12 to to18 inches awayand I do not force myself to look atthat light I don't hold my eyelids openI allow myself to Blink so I'mcomfortable truth told you couldprobably close your eyelids and some ofthat red light is going to get throughyour eyelids not a ton but some so noproblem blinking you never ever everwant to look at any light sunlight orotherwise red light any light so brightthat it's painful to look at if you haveto Blink it's too bright step back ifyou have to Blink every once in a whilethat's okay but if you have to Blink inorder to to close your eyes in order toprotect your eyes then you're standingtoo close in the morning you can do redlight therapy on skin you can do it oneyes will it wake your system up will itprovide the kind of uh cortisol increasewhich by the way you want early in theday and adrenaline and dopamine increasethat sunlight can provide the answer isno sunlight is unique in that wayhowever if you live in an area of theworld that's too dark or um you wake uplong before you get sunlight in youreyes what can you do well you can flipon artificial lights you would do thatthe opposite of how I recommend in theevening you'd want to flip on overheadlights as bright as possible if you umhave the disposable income and you wantto invest in a 10,000 Lux Light Panel or900 Lux Light Panel again I have noFinancial relationship to thesecompanies but um there's a light panel900 Lux drawing tablet that I've set onmy desk for a number of years recently Iconfess I've started um uh experimentingwith some of the 10,000 Lux light panelsthat sit on your Des desk excuse methose are very very bright and I do usethat now if I wake up really early andI'm going to do some work I'll turn thatthing on and it sure wakes you up now isit as good as sunlight no it doesn'thave the right color features andalternation between yellow and blue thatmorning sunlight has and that eveningsunlight has and without doing a wholetutorial when the sun is low in the skySo-Cal low solar angle sunlight you'llnotice if you take a picture with yourphone provid it's not a cloudy dayyou'll see that there's a lot of blueyellow contrast and that's the optimalstimulus that said if it's overcast outyou should still get outside becausesome of those W lengths are comingthrough even though you can't perceivethe blue and the yellow so these youcould get a 10,000 Lux light but if youcan't afford that or you don't want tooh and by the way those you you set onyour desk you turn on for 5 10 minuteswhile you're making coffee and things ofthat sort they actually recommend thatyou don't keep them on too much somepeople actually can feel a little tooeuphoric or maybe even get a littleheadache because it's a lot of bluelight so that's one thing the otherthing you can do is that if you can't uhuh access light of any kind just darkdark dark that's where the cold showerreally can help because you get thatadrenaline bump um early in the daywhich is good so early in the day youknow provided you're not going intostates of anxiety as a consequence of itgetting adrenaline dopamine cortisolincreases is great and then as the daygoes on in the evening and night timecertainly you want to taper the levelsof those neurochemicals off now ofcourse there's always going to be somecortisol there's always going to be someepinephrine there'll always be dopamineyour system if you go out dancing you goto a party at night should you worryabout the lights no okay I am notdespite what you might presume or hearor read I am notuh the sort of person who wearsunglasses at a party although the otherday I was at a party and someone waswearing sunglass I think it was forother reasons the um the that that givesthe impression there was something badgoing on I think they were just likelooking cool by the way um and they didlook cool but I don't do that and if Idrive at night I don't wear I don't wearum sunglasses I do and I have beenexploring the use of blue light filterglasses in the evening and those redlights in my house but for I think formost people if you get out every once ina while you go out to a late night yougo out dancing you have a party withfriends you know you get home dim thelights maybe use those red lights get tosleep early in the day Bright Lightsideally from sunlight bright brightbright bright bright how bright asbright as possible and as many as you uhisreasonable except to the extent that itcould damage your eyes so don't bestaring at any Bright Lights excessivelyokay I think that that pretty muchsummarizes it and then of course earlyday it's really about sunlight or lightof other kinds cold water if that's yourthing if that's not your thing that'sfinethere was no tablet that uh descendeddown to us telling us that we had to getinto cold water each day it's an optionit's all anoption Dennis from Munich I love Munichhaven't been there in a while but I usedtogo in MOX plunk Munich for a number ofum times per year and I missed the foodI

butI'm working and then another time duringthe week a shorter workout of about 12minutes it's going to be 3 minutes ofwarm-up some calisthenics a little bitof cycling on an assault bike orsomething of that sort assault bikes arethe ones where you have the handles withthe fan or it could be a rower or itcould be any sprinting a hill and thendoing sometimes one minute on one minuteoff for 12 minutes sometimes doing 20seconds on 10 seconds off for eightrounds and it's real work it's gettingthe heart rate all the way up VO2 maxthe combination of those three threetypes of cardiovascular trainingsessions are that I'm ready to Sprintfor the airplane I'm ready to take along hike anytime I'm I can go out for atwo mile run and really enjoy that if Iif I need to it's a Readiness thing andI think it covers all bases am I evergoing to be a marathoner or a championsprinter with that or a Myer no butthat's not my goal and it never has beenI ran a cross country race in highschool and we tell out story anothertime it was a lot of funun until I hitthe second milethe other thing I do three times a weekis I work out with resistance training Itrain my legs one day so that's calveshamstrings quads I train my torso sothat's I do some pushing for myshoulders and upper chest and some dipsthat kind of thing some pull-ups somerowing this sort of thing and I train myneck because I'm a big believer in thatfor the upper spine but um don't don'tgo at it heavy it's just really tomaintain you know uh posture and to makesure that upper upper spine is supportedsomething that most peopleneglect and then one day a week Ido smaller body parts like I'll do myCal train my calves again biceps tricepsI'll make sure that if they're any smallbody parts that happen to miss duringthe middle of the week because ofscheduling like rear delts or somethingI'll do that maybe a little bit moreneck work or some ab work okay those arespread out about a day apart I don't gettoo obsessed with the spacing betweenthose workouts but they're not allstacked against one another so it mightbe in my case it's it's long run onSunday this is just how I do it Mondaytends to be off uh excuse me long run onSunday or hike Monday is legs excuse meMonday is always legs Tuesday offWednesday I generally would do thatshorter run or the Torso work Iflip-flop them depending on how my legsare feeling and the next day I dowhatever I need to do either the Torsoresistance training or the or the 35minute run and then Friday is thatfaster clip cardio Saturday tends to bethe smaller body parts biceps tricepsEtc I must say these days of the weekalways have the ability ability to slidewhen we or the other so for instance ifI'm traveling and I don't get back onSunday until late I'll if I was not ableto do that training while I was on theroad then I will do it on Monday andthen I'll just slide things around sothat I finish off the week witheverything done and I can get back onschedule but the way I've arranged itevery body part gets hit twice oncedirectly once indirectly and thecardiovascular training is is covers allbases why train this way well it ensuresstrength it ensures whatever aestheticchanges you want you can emphasizeworking harder in more sets perhaps forthe things that you you know want tobring up certain body parts that arethat are weaker you can um certainlyrecover because you're only traininglegs once a week but guess what you'reyou're doing them on Monday and you'resprinting on Friday so they're gettinghit indirectly on Friday even if it's onthe bike though that fast hard pedalingwith resistance is going to make surethat your legs aren't going to atrophyyou can still get butt you can stilltrain them again on Monday again so thisschedule is designed in a very specificway none of the workouts except thelonger workout on Sunday that jog orRunner is longer than an hour ever it's10 minutes of warmup and 5050 minutes ofwork in the gym sometimes 60 sometimesI'll truncate it to 45 or 40 if I'mreally I have a bunch of things going onso this sort of schedule sounds like alot but it's not it's actually a verysmall investment it's about an hour aday and not even on Tuesday which is arest day so what are the metrics that Irecommend checking well I'm a bigbeliever that if you're sleeping welland your appetite is consistent andyou're feeling generally good that's animportant metric it's a very subjectivemetric but that's important are yousleeping well or are you waking up soreand you're not able to recover are youfeeling like no matter how much sleepyou get you can't feel rested thesekinds of things now there could be otherfactors involved but that's the you knowsort of a basic one the other one is howmuch energy and pep are you bringing toyour workouts that's important and itrelate to caffeine and fueling and allthose sorts of things which we're nottalking about right now it's far toomuch to talk about here but we did Coverin the foundational Fitness protocol bythe way all of this is put into a PDFthat's available online at hbermanlab.com zeroc cost simply go to thenewsletter T tab under the menu and youcan scroll down um below that find thefoundational Fitness protocol gets intosets and Reps and loads and all thatkind of stuff completely zerocost I do take my morning resting pulserate I know what my pulse rate ought tobe if it's elevated substantially andI'm not particularly stressed aboutsomething then I might pay attention tothat and back off a little bit on theintensity on things if I have a throatTickler I'm not feeling very well I'mreally careful about working outsometimes I'll do it sometimes I won'tI'll make sure that isn't just some sortof like dust or allergen in theenvironment but if I'm feeling under theweather I'll take I'll just skip I justskipped that workout and some people gooh you you skip because you're you knowI'll be honest I'm 48 been training veryconsistently I am fortunately knock onwood a little bit suspicious knock onwood I have avoided major injuries I'vebeen able to train consistently and I'vealso don't tend to succumb to colds andflu I think about once every 18 to 24months I've had colder flu of some sortfor for many years that's been the thekind of cadence but not more frequentthan that I think in part because Idon't tend to push really hard when I'msick I tend to be the guy who goes allright I'm feeling kind of under theweather should I train maybe not okayI'm going to take a hot shower and getin bed at 6 PM read and go to sleep if Iwake up at 3:00 a.m. because I went tobed too early just chill in bed and readmaybe fall back asleep maybe not I thinktaking care of oneself in that way isvery beneficial and then people say wellyou haven't had kids well I've had kidsin the house and I also knowwhat it is to get sick because ofroommates and all this stuff and workingwith people and working in a medicalcenter you're always exposed to thingsso um I hear you loud and clear we can'tavoid exposure to um infectious vectorsas they're called um delightful in theform of kids but uh the reality is I tryand back off when I'm not feeling well Ipush when I'm feeling good I'm not oneto do two a day workouts and I'm verycareful about not exceeding my myprogram I'm very careful about that thatI don't go crazy I don't do two Pilatesclasses then go to the gym and I'm alsonot the guy who's complaining about hisback or always being sick and I do nothave you know like phenomenal geneticsfor with respect to Fitness you I'msmall jointed or relatively havemediumsized joints you know I'm notparticularly strong nor do I haveparticularly strong endurance you know Ithink I'm kind of in the middle so interms of medical Fitness check I doblood work every six months I find thatto be that has identified a few thingsthat for me needed taken care of and Ipay a lot of attention to overallfeelings of well-being and I chart themfrankly I on my calendar it's my are myworkouts I put the level I put like L1to 10 typically my workouts are in thesix to8 out of 10 intensity I'm notmeasuring this by any kind of um deviceand if I get sick I tend to look backand say what was going on before I gotsick you know um if I'm gettingsubstantially weaker or I'm feeling uhfatigued I I I take stock of what'sgoing on so I think um some people getthe impression that I'm like hyperanalytic about all things and um youknow I would say Atia is much more intomeasuring things and I love that abouthim I'm more of the mindset like if I ifI'm feeling good and I feel I'm like Ican move my body well not too many achesand pains occas I get a little somethingof a little D disc bulge or somethingbut and and then I take care of it butin general it's about being able to feelgood seated feel good moving be able tohave that Readiness Readiness Readinessfor me that's the foundation of ofhealth so um other uh things you get aregular eye exam I do have

I also try andrelax my face if I do this right nowit's going to be funny but relaxing theface tends to relax the jaw and thenI'll do a progressive bodyrelaxation I do use the Revy re v r iapp and they have a specific hypnosisfor falling back asleep hypnosis isself-directed hypnosis David Spiegelwho's been a guest on the podcast hisvoice is terrific for hypnosis even justthinking about his voice makes me wantto go under typically with Revy youpractice the falling asleep falling backasleep hypnosis it's only eight minuteslong you practice that in the daytimeand then you can use in the middle ofthe night if you need to that doesrequire that you have your phone presentand by the way if you're going to dothat hypnosis you can select whether ornot you're going to do the one where youhave to interact and speak or not I likethe one where you don't interact also ifyou sleep next to someone it won't wakethem up revery is great for this purposeand and you might think hypnosis that'swacky or that's um you know Magic Carpetstuff but it's not this is uh you knowhypnosis by the way is one of the few umapproved Medical Treatments for variouspsychological psychiatric conditionswe're not talking about stage hypnosispeople clucking like chickens we'retalking about you learning toself-direct relaxation which is a skillthat you can enhance in hypnosis such aswith Revy I think Revy now is a a freetrial and it's available on Android andApple and it's a nominal cost when youcompare to things like supplements orsleeping pills it's a few dollars eachmonth maybe $78 something like thatsomeone will tell me but if you thinkabout the cost relative to you know someother purchasable it's relatively lowthe other thing and this is something iscompletely zero cost and I can'tencourage it enough is that you get intoa regular practice of nonsleep deep restnsdr or Yoga Nidra and that you do thatduring the daytime there's a 10-minutensdr that I did which is available onYouTube you just put nsdr huberman it'savailable completely zero costit will teach you how to self-directyour ownrelaxation and you can also use in themiddle of the night if you wake up manypeople fall asleep during ndrs that'sfine or yoga nras many of which areavailable on the internet free okaycompletely free Yoga Nidra is a littlebit different than nsdr it is a categoryof non-sleep deep rest that includesintentions and things of that sortself-directed relaxation but relaxing isa skill now there are a few things thatyou can do to avoid waking up in themiddle of the night one is try and limitthe total amount of fluid that you drinkin the last couple hours before sleepdon't go to bed with a super Full Bellyum some people find that if they taketheanine which is something that is inthe Sleep stack that I recommend and bythe way I don't necessarily believe thateveryone needs to take supplements inorder to sleep I think you should getthe behavioral stuff the light theexercise not drinking caffeine too latein the day avoiding alcohol ideallycompletely but maybe late in the dayespecially etc etc and if you can't getyour sleep right that way then perhapsyou start to rely on or enhance yoursleep capabilities with supplements butthey're certainly not arequirement the sleep supplementtheanine which is in the so-call hubunlab sleep stack which includes magnesium3and8 and appenine uh and theaninetheanine for some people can reallycreate vivid dreams and then they wakeup from those dreams they have a hardtime falling asleep in that case I wouldjust reduce the dosage of or eliminatethe theanine some people like to useanoco 900 milligram anoco because theyprefer that and it that works better oruh for them than the Sleep stack or somepeople even take it in addition to theSleep stack um as long as dosages arefollowed there's no reason to think thatany of the stuff isn't safe but ofcourse check with your doctor beforeadding or removing anything from yoursupplement protocol or any protocol forthat matter I say that to protect younot to protect me the other thing thatyou can do if you wake up in the middleof the night is to not look at the timenow that's a little bit difficult ifyou're going to look at your phone butyou know this is something that Folks atthe Stanford Sleep Clinic taught me thatpeople who look at the time when theywake up in the middle of the nightgenerally have a harder time fallingback asleep so that to the extent thatyou can refrain from doing that andcertainly don't get on your phone andstart scrolling social media um try nsdrtry the revery app try yoganidra trysome long exhale breathing all thoseprotocols by the way include long exhalebreathing and if you're taking melatoninbefore sleep oftentimes you'll fallasleep very readily and then wake up soif you're taking melatonin you mightwant to reconsider that melatonin doeshave its place for treatment of jet lagand things of that sort in the acutesituations and not taking it too oftenbut in general dosages are too highpeople take too much of it and too oftenin my opinion but that's just my opinionand then I would say if you wake up inthe middle of the night and you simplycannot fall back asleep just rememberthat you can survive one night withminimal or no sleep unfortunately we'veall had to deal with that if it startsbecoming a chronic condition then youmay want to talk to a sleep specialistbut we've done multiple episodes of thehubman loud podcast the master yoursleep perfect your sleep we have a sleepnewsletter that you should definitelydownload it's zero cost again hubinlab.com newsletter go to menu newsletterand you can find that for those of youthat subscribed to the premium channelI'm guessing that you're a aware ofthese um various uh tools but one thingwe know from the Sleep Lab at Stanfordis that when people are excited abouttheir next day sometimes they wake upand that their sleep actually can beless than normal and they can functionwell the next day in fact there havebeen two studies at least that I'm awareof two studies there may bemore showing that when people are givena quote unquote poor sleep score theircognitive Performance and Physicalperformance has diminished even if theyslept really long and really well sothey've lied to them in these studiesconversely if people haven't slept thatmuch and they rece receive a great sleepscore they perform really well so thesesleep scores while I like them I look atmy eight sleep sleep score or whoopsleep scoresome people use aura rings and things ofthat sort you don't want them to driveyour perception of how available you arefor hard work and cognitive functionit's why I tend to rely largely onsubjective measures unless you weretalking about things like apob orcholesterol levels you know subjectivelyuh guessing what your apob level is isnot a good approach right or restingheart rate they're real metrics but youwant to be careful about relying tooheavily on um Biometrics gleaned fromdevices even if they're accurate don'tput too much weight into them take theaverage see how you're doing lately ifyour sleep score is dropping each day by15 20 points well then pay attention tothat or your heart rate's going up orit's going down you know averagesaverages averages you know and so be ascientist of yourself coach Ruby writeswhat's the best protocol for strain"

it's a lotweaker I mean I am a big believer indoing unilateral movements I can'tremember last time I did a barbell curlor or a or a you know the thing theycall the Easy Bar tricep extension Ialmost always do unilateral stuffdumbbell curls I think the real key ifyou want a weaker arm or limb to getstronger is that mind muscle connectionyou know it means presumably unlessthere's some sort of under underlyingneurologic thing and I don't want toscare you it's always possible it seemsunlikely based on the way you worri thequestion is that you want to make sureyou're gripping the handle the weightreally tightly by the way that willincrease your strength and performanceon a set to grip tightly there's neuralreasons forthat and that you're really working hardto contract the muscle and also useweights that you can control rememberwhen you lift weights for the sake ofgetting stronger it's not about liftingweights you're actually using the weightas a tool to stimulate strength andhypertrophy increases so it's a tool andyou don't walk around with the weightnumber on your body you walk around withthe muscle development that you achievedand the strength that youachieved with a particular weight and noone cares what that weight is so ifyou're you know if you can't carry twobags of groceries up the stairs um itdoesn't matter if you were able to youknow carry 400 lb dumbbells through thegym right I mean that's why I think theReadiness thing is key I think we thinkso much about the gym as the as the endpoint but the gym is a place fortraining for the rest of life in myopinion it also happens to be fun for mebut um if your left arm is weaker Iwould emphasize well you could perhapsdo more sets certainly I would do youcould do all your left arm sets firstthen your right arm sets if it's reallysubstantially different you may actuallywant to stop training the right side asintensely for a period of time and getthat left arm up there uh things likethat but I like unilateral work I don'tdo a lot of unilateral work for my legslet me think I do leg curls no that'sboth legs same time I definitely try andpull with both legs same time legextension same time uh hack squat sametime glute ham same time okay yeah umjust keep training it but don'tovertrain it if it's really weak becauseyou're giving it 25 sets make sureyou're allowing time for it to recoverand by the way I don't know um uh how II don't recall because the question'sgone now how old your but you give yourbody time give your body time I startedtraining when I was 16 give your bodytimeit takes time to train correctly and ittakes time to develop a strong mindmuscle connection and you don't don'trush don't run out there and start usingyou know uh don't get cavaliere withPharmaceuticals or anything else justtake your time enjoy your training thebest advice I ever got about training umwith somebody very accomplished and hesaid and I really internalized I likelearn to and you may delete the learn tolearn to enjoy training really hard orjust love training hard I love traininghard I love it I love it I love it sojust learn that like lean into thatprocess and enjoy it and if you and ifthere's certain parts that arechallenging remember you're increasingthe size of that medial interior midsingulate cortex last question really Iwas I was hoping we just keep goingmaybe I'll do like a 24-hour marathon ofthis and then we also do it as a as astudy in sleep deprivation does anyonewant to vote for that I've done thatbefore I used to work 36 hour stretcheswhen I was in graduate school no joke wewould do these physiology experiments myproducer here is sitting here going likedon't do it but it's righta by the endof those experiments we'd be wearing tinfoil on our heads and we were doingthese experiments but we built a lot ofresilience we used to survive on In andOut Burgers and I was like don't eat thebun because the carbs will make yousleepy and then we' we'd argue about itand we' you know we'd start tohallucinate somewhere around the 30 hourmark and my friend Kenzo he's now aprofessor back at uh University ofMaryland so he can he can vouch for thatstory but gosh that was fun I I don'tmiss it I was in my 20s uh 30s yeah no20s late 20s umbut if people think it be maybe we do afundraiser like to ra raise extra moneyfor research and I'll do 24 hours ofjust answering questions around theclock and just see how you know see atwhat point I just completely and then Ican also teach you guys how to do aproper all nighter because there aretools and the one of the main tools isdon't trust your thinking between thehours of 2:30 a.m. and 4:00 a.m. somaybe during that time we just allmeditate together all right lastquestion until we do the 24-hour hun labAMA Marathon do you

    "episode_summary": "Welcome to a special edition of the 14th Ask Me Anything (AMA) episode, part of Huberman Lab Premium. This episode is a recording of a live stream AMA, originally exclusive to our Annual and Lifetime Members. We've decided to make the full-length version available to everyone, including non-members of Huberman Lab Premium.\nHuberman Lab Premium was launched for two main reasons. First, it was launched in order to raise support for the main Huberman Lab podcast \u2014 which will continue to come out every Monday at zero-cost. Second, it was launched as a means to raise funds for important scientific research. A significant portion of proceeds from the Huberman Lab Premium subscription will fund human research (not animal models) selected by Dr. Huberman, with a dollar-for-dollar match from the Tiny Foundation.\nIf you're not yet a member but enjoyed this full-length livestream AMA, we invite you to join Huberman Lab Premium. By subscribing, you'll gain access to exclusive benefits including our regular monthly full-length AMA episodes, AMA transcripts, podcast episode transcripts, early access to live events and more. Additionally, a significant portion of your membership proceeds contributes to advancing human scientific research. You can learn more about the research we were able to support in our Annual Letter 2023.\nIf you're a Huberman Lab Premium member, you can access the transcript for this AMA episode here."
