            "text": "ANDREW HUBERMAN: Welcome\nto the Huberman Lab podcastwhere we discuss science\nand science-based toolsfor everyday life.[MUSIC PLAYING]I'm Andrew Huberman,\nand I'm a professorof neurobiology\nand ophthalmologyat Stanford School of Medicine.My guest today is David Goggins.David Goggins is a\nretired Navy SEAL whoserved in Iraq and Afghanistan.He's also a highly accomplished\nultramarathon runner.For those of you\nthat don't know,ultramarathons are\ndistances longerthan 26 miles and, in\nDavid's case, often longerthan 200 miles.For his achievements\nin athletics,he has been inducted into\nthe International SportsHall of Fame.He also held a Guinness World\nRecord for the most pull-upscompleted in 24 hours.I should mention that not only\nwas David a decorated NavySEAL, but he also graduated\nfrom Army Ranger School.David is also a highly\nsuccessful writer,having authored two books, the\nfirst entitled \"Can't Hurt Me\"and the second entitled \"Never\nFinished,\" both of whichare best sellers.David's books cover\nmany topics, includinghis autobiographical\ndescription of what can onlybe described as an\nincredibly challenging childand young adulthood.His home was abusive.His school environment\nwas abusive.He essentially had no positive\nresources directed his way and.In his 20s, he found himself\nto be obese, that is,more than 300\npounds working a jobhe despised for minimal pay.And it was at that point that\nDavid began an inner dialoguethat forced him to explore\nthe demons born outof his childhood but also the\nposition that he found himselfin as a young man and\nthen began the journeyto navigate that dialogue and\ntransform himself into the NavySEAL, the ultramarathon\nrunner, the bestselling author,and the extraordinarily\npositive and influential manthat he is today.As some of you may\nknow, David hasdone various public lectures.He's a familiar face\nonline because there are somany clips of him on YouTube.And he has done podcasts before.However, I'm certain that\nyou'll find today's discussionto be very different\nthan previous podcaststhat David has been featured on.The reason is\nthat-- of course, weget into his accomplishments.We talk about the\nmindset that allowedhim to achieve those things.But, today, David really\nlets us under the hood.He lets us into the\nform of inner dialoguethat he has to\nembrace, indeed that hehas to grapple with on a daily\nbasis, sometimes multiple timesthroughout the day\nand night in orderto impose the sort\nof self-disciplinethat he is so well known for.We also get into some of\nthe scientific mechanismsunderlying willpower.And we talk about\nDavid's current endeavorsthat include, for instance,\nhis own exploration of scienceand medicine for which he\nhas become an intense scholarand practitioner.I should mention that multiple\ntimes throughout today'sdiscussion you will\nhear curse words.Now David and I both\nacknowledge that cursingisn't for everybody\nand that cursingitself is different than\ncursing at somebody.Nonetheless, we do realize\nthat many people, parentsperhaps especially, might\nnot want to hear cursing.If you don't want\nto hear cursing,well, then this podcast episode\nis probably not for you.However, if you are\ncomfortable with cursingor if you can tolerate\nit, I assure youtoday's discussion\nis highly worthwhile.Before we begin, I'd\nlike to emphasize"

            "text": "that this podcast is separate\nfrom my teaching and researchroles at Stanford.It is, however, part\nof my desire and effortto bring zero cost to\nconsumer informationabout science and\nscience-related toolsto the general public.In keeping with\nthat theme, I'd liketo thank the sponsors\nof today's podcast.Our first sponsor\nis Maui Nui Venison.Maui Nui Venison is the most\nnutrient dense and deliciousred meat available.I've spoken before\non this podcastand there's general consensus\nthat most people should striveto consume approximately\n1 gram of proteinper pound of body weight.Now when one strives\nto do that, it'simportant to maximize the\nquality of that protein intaketo the calorie ratio\nbecause you don'twant to consume an\nexcess of calorieswhen trying to get\nthat 1 gram of proteinper pound of body weight.Maui Nui Venison has an\nextremely high quality proteinto calorie ratio.So it makes getting that 1\ngram of protein per poundof body weight extremely easy.It's also delicious.Personally, I like\nthe ground venison.I also like the venison steaks.And then for convenience\nwhen I'm on the road,I like the jerky.The jerky has a very high\nprotein to calorie ratio.So it has as much as 10 grams\nof protein per jerky stick,and it has something\nlike only 55 calories,so, again, making\nit very easy to getenough protein without\nconsuming excess calories.If you would like to\ntry Maui Nui Venison,you can go to\nmauinuivenison.com/hubermanto get 20% off your first order.Again, that's\nmauinuivenison.com/hubermanto get 20% off.Today's episode is also\nbrought to us by AeroPress.AeroPress is similar to a\nFrench press for making coffee,but it is, in fact, a much\nbetter way to make coffee.I first learned about AeroPress\nwell over 10 years ago.And I've been using\none ever since.AeroPress was developed\nby Alan Adler, whowas an engineer at Stanford.And I knew of Alan\nbecause he had alsobuilt the so-called Aerobie\nFrisbee, which I believeat one time, perhaps\nstill now, heldthe Guinness Book\nof World Recordsfor furthest thrown object.And I used to see Alan,\nbelieve it or not,at parks around Palo Alto\ntesting out different AerobieFrisbees.So he was sort of\nfamous in our communityfor developing these\ndifferent feats of engineeringthat turned into\ncommercial products.Now I love coffee.I'm somebody that drinks coffee\nnearly every day, usuallyabout 90 to 120\nminutes after I wake upin the morning,\nalthough not always.Sometimes if I'm\ngoing to exercise,I'll drink coffee first\nthing in the morning.But I love, love, love coffee.And what I've personally found\nis that by using the AeroPress,I can make the best possible\ntasting cup of coffee.I don't know what exactly\nit is in the AeroPress thatallows the same\nbeans to be preparedinto a cup of coffee that tastes\nthat much better as comparedto any other form of\nbrewing that coffee, eventhe traditional French press.The AeroPress is\nextremely easy to use.And it's extremely compact.In fact, I take it with\nme whenever I travel.And I use it on the road,\nin hotels, even on planes.I'll just ask for\nsome hot water,and I'll brew my coffee or\ntea right there on the plane.If you'd like to try\nAeroPress, you can goto aeropress.com/huberman.That's A-E-R-O-P-R-E-S-S dotcom\nslash Huberman to get 20% offany aeropress coffeemaker.AeroPress ships anywhere\nin the USA, Canada,and over 60 other\ncountries around the world.Again, that's\naeropress.com/huberman to get20% off.Today's episode is also\nbrought to us by Eight Sleep.Eight Sleep makes smart mattress\ncovers with cooling, heating,and sleep tracking capacity.I've spoken many times\nbefore on this podcastabout the fact that\nsleep is the foundationof mental health, physical\nhealth, and performance.Now a key component of\ngetting a great night's sleepis that in order to fall\nand stay deeply asleep,your body temperature\nactually hasto drop by about 1 to 3 degrees.And in order to wake up feeling\nrefreshed and energized,your body temperature\nactually hasto increase by about\n1 to 3 degrees.One of the best ways to make\nsure that those temperaturechanges occur at the appropriate\ntimes, at the beginningand throughout and at the end\nof your night when you wake up,is to control the temperature\nof your sleeping environment.And that's what Eight\nSleep allows you to do.It allows you to program the\ntemperature of your mattressand sleeping environment\nsuch that you falland stay deeply asleep\neasily and wake upeach morning feeling incredibly\nrefreshed and energized.I've been sleeping on\nan Eight Sleep mattresscover for almost\nthree years now.And it has dramatically improved\nthe quality of my sleep.If you'd like to\ntry

            "text": "Good to see you again, man.ANDREW HUBERMAN:\nGreat to see you.It was late 2016,\nearly 2017, I believe,when you were in\nmy lab at Stanford.DAVID GOGGINS: Yes sir.ANDREW HUBERMAN: We did a\nlittle work later that daydown in San Jose.And, gosh, see you everywhere,\nbut it's not enough.So great to have you here.DAVID GOGGINS: Thanks for\nhaving me on, brother.ANDREW HUBERMAN: Yeah.You embody discipline\nand doing hard things.I think we should just\nstart right off with--DAVID GOGGINS: Yeah.Let's just go there.ANDREW HUBERMAN:\n--the bold truth.But right before\nwe went hot mics,we were talking about learning.Right now, you're spending some\ntime learning and doing thingsthat I think most people\nprobably don't typicallyassociate David Goggins with.DAVID GOGGINS: Right.ANDREW HUBERMAN: Why don't\nyou tell us about that?DAVID GOGGINS: Well,\nmost people justlook at me as the guy that\nruns and yells as he's running.While I do that to\nmotivate people,but people don't understand\nthat my day is broken upinto segments.I work out.I eat.I sleep, but I spend\nmost of my time studying.So like I'm in\nthe medical world.I'm a paramedic in Canada.But I spend a lot\nof my time tryingto nuke every single thing\nabout it because I'm nottrying to just be a\nparamedic, learn about veins,and arteries, and how the heart\npumps, and stuff like that.I'm trying to learn\nto the point whereI can save someone's life.And even though paramedics are\ndoing that all over the world,I'm trying to be that\nparamedic that can reallydissect exactly what's going on\nand figure out what medicationgoes where, just trying to\nlearn the algorithm of what'sgoing on, man.So I spent a lot\nof time with it.ANDREW HUBERMAN: I\nlove the word algorithmbecause when I teach\nbiology or try and learnanything that's related\nto biology and especiallythe human body, I need\nto know the nouns.But it's the verbs that matter.And that's really what\nyou're talking about.Just saying that sits there,\nthat brain part there,doesn't tell you how\nit all works together.So what does your process\nfor studying look like?If we dropped a\ncamera in the room,brought a microphone into\nyour inner dialogue--gosh, wouldn't we all love that.But if we dropped a microphone\ninto your inner dialogue,are you waking up looking\nat the books and going,yeah, fresh day, let's learn or\nis some of the same resistancethat you've talked about\ncoming up around physical work,is that coming up\nfrom time to time?DAVID GOGGINS: You know\nwhat, I was nervous at first.I'm going to keep it real.I'm going to keep it real.So I'm not a real smart guy.And what I mean by that is\nI was born with ADD, ADHD.Like my brain cannot\nretain information.I'm not some genetic freak\nwhen it comes to running,when it comes to\nlifting weights.I am absolutely the\nbottom of the barrel.And people will\nnever believe me.And they can just whatever.Believe what you\nwant to believe.So when you ask me this question\nabout what does studying looklike for me, I have to go over\nthe same page over, and over,and over, and over again, while\nJennifer can look at that pagewhile she's quizzing me,\nshe'll learn it right thenas she's-- she didn't\nknow anything about it.She will quiz herself\nor quiz me and learn itas she's quizzing me.It's the most frustrating\nthing in the worldhow my brain works.So what I do is I literally\nsit there with a pen and paper.And I have my books.And I go through and\nhave to write everythingdown every single day.I will study the\nsame page until it'sphotographic memory from\nwriting the same thing down.And then from there, I'll go\nback through and relearn itagain.So I'll learn the bulk of it.But then I'll go through\nand learn the small thingswithin that.So if it's a medication, I'll\nlearn what the medication does.First, I'll learn\nhow to even saythe medication because\nthese medications aren'tlike albuterol.No, it's very big words.So I'll go through, learn\nhow to say the name.Then I'll go through\nlearn what the dose is.Then I'll go through-- and\nthis is like every single day.So it's not like, oh, I got it.Let's just go through--\nno, nothing is I got it.Every single thing--\nso I can't waitto get in this conversation\nbecause everythingI do in life, it sucks.Everything I do\nin life, it sucks.That's why when I was 300\npounds and 24 years old,it wasn't like I had some\nbig epiphany of let's justgo be a Navy SEAL, and\nlet's lose some weight.No, I knew my entire\nlife was goingto be a struggle, which\nis why I just ignored it.And I said, I'm not even trying\nto jump off any of this shitand learn how to read, how\nto write, how to memorize,how to become\nsomething I am not.But through that process,\nsomething happened to me.And I realized-- this is\nwhy I feel sorry for no one.In this podcast, they're\ngoing to really not like mebecause people\nare going to thinkthat I am maybe lying or\nmaybe fibbing or exaggerating.No, I am literally--I was the lowest form on Earth,\nno talent, no ability to learn.And I literally know what\nit is to be rock bottomand to build that up.So that question about\nlearning is the pain in my ass.And I don't have to do it.Just think about it.I'm 49 years old, and\nI'm a multi-millionaire.I don't have to do anything.So all I thought about\nwhen I was growing upis, man, I can't wait to\none day get to the pointwhere I no longer\nhave to do this stuff.But what happened\nas I got older,it became a way of living.So how I do every day\nis how I do every day.It's a discipline.It's a regimen.It was a choice I made.And the choice I made was what\nare you willing to sacrifice,and what are you willing to\ngive up to find every bit of whoyou are as a human being?And I was willing to give\nup everything to do that.So studying is no joke.ANDREW HUBERMAN: I love\nthat you're studying.I recall a few years ago, I\nheard some interview or podcastwith you.And you just threw out like I\ndon't know what I'll do next.Maybe I'll be a scientist.And I went yeah.Because I knew-- because\nI know you a bit.And I see your work\nout there, but wehad met before,\nthat if you decidedthat you were going to do it--and learning medicine,\nwhich is what you're doing,learning human physiology\nis so detailed.DAVID GOGGINS: Very.ANDREW HUBERMAN:\nAnd people out therehave to understand when\nyou look at a textbookand you see the veins and the\ncapillaries different colors,when the body is open,\nthey're not different colors.DAVID GOGGINS:\nRight, right, right.ANDREW HUBERMAN: So\nI mean, some thingshave different color\ncontrasts, but it's notlike it's all labeled\nwhen you pop it open.DAVID GOGGINS: Exactly.ANDREW HUBERMAN: And so the\nprocess of writing things down"

            "text": "by hand is important for you.So you go back and\nread those notes.Do you think about\nthat stuff on your runstoo or are you\nsegmenting your daylike when you're done studying,\nare you heading out for a runand thinking about other things?Or are you still rehearsing\nthe material in your head?DAVID GOGGINS: So when I write\nit down, I write it down,and I'm able to--I'm actually looking\ndown at this tableright now because\nI'm back to writing.So I'm actually there right\nnow as I'm speaking to you.I write it down in a way\nthat I'm memorizing page 69.So I'm writing it down.So then writing it down and that\npage sync together in my brain.So I'm looking at the book\nin my brain right now.That's just how it works for me.And I have to do it\nover and over again.So that page is\nstuck in my mind.So I'm literally\nflipping through pagesas I'm taking these tests.And I'm taking these national\ntests to become a paramedicor become an advanced\nEMT or whatever.I'm literally as I'm taking\nthat test I'm going through.And I'm like-- now I'm\nflipping pages in my headwhere that page was.And how I do that is\njust from how I write itand how it's on the page.When I run, I can't\nrecall any of it.I cannot bring any of\nthat because I'm running.How my mind is wired now is that\neverything I do is what I do.Because the focus it takes for\nme to-- right now, I'm running.I'm not like a great runner.I'm not like injury free.So like my first 20 minutes\nof the run I'm limping.I'm literally\nlimping because I'vehad several knee surgeries.And my body was twisted.And so now it's untwisting.So people look at me, oh, looks,\nlike he's limping when he runs.I am limping when I run.My body is jacked\nup so I'm focusingon how to get the best\nout of a broken body.So everything I do\nis a total focuson what I'm doing at\nthat point in my life.ANDREW HUBERMAN: So it\nseems like you've reallytrained away or somehow\ngotten away from the ADDthat you mentioned\nbecause what you describedis like a deep trench.It's like a V shaped trench.I'm imagining like\nthere's a ball bearing,and it's like, phewp, and it can\nonly go forward in that trenchor back.And it goes forward.It's not like sliding around\nat the concave at the bottom,zip-zip-zip, like a tension.So it's like you\ntrained that up.Is there a similar\nfeeling when you'rein the full focus of running\nversus full focus of studying?Does it kind of\nfeel like, oh yeah,that's the same groove but\ndifferent thing or is itjust completely different world?DAVID GOGGINS: It's a\ncompletely different world.Both of them for\nme is suffering,but it's suffering a\nwhole different way.Like when I was going through\nschool, I never forget--I think I was in third grade.And back then, ADD, ADHD,\nwasn't like here's this medicineor here's this thing.They want to put you\nin a special school.So for me, I was so\nfar behind in learningthat their big thing\nwas let's just put himin a special school\nbecause he'll never learn.And through that\nprocess of like Idon't want to be in\na special school,I don't want to be treated\nany differently, it really--like I never took medication.I've never taken\nmedication for this.That's why right now you see\nme looking right in your eyes.What the hell is Huberman\nsaying right now.And that's why I don't feel\nbad for people who have ADHD,who have learning disabilities.And some are impossible\nbecause you just can't.But a lot of them you can.But people don't want to go\nthrough the process of focus,of teaching yourself\nhow to truly focus.This is where my\nmessage gets lost.It gets lost because I may\nsay MF or F because that'sthe passion that\ncomes out of me.It takes everything for\nme to learn a sentence.So when I speak\nabout David Goggins,I can't speak about David\nGoggins in a way that'sjust calm and cool.Because when I wake\nup, I know the journeythat it takes for me\nto find my greatness.And it's hard.Nothing is easy.Nothing just like, oh, I\nwake up, and I just do thisor I do that or it just--\nno, I watch people every daygo through life,\nand it's so easy.For me to be where I'm at\ntoday, it takes every bit of me.So when I speak about it,\nand as I get going here,you'll start seeing me--\nthe tempo will rise.The passion will come out\nbecause I'm back there.I'm doing what I do every\nday to become a human being.And so nothing is easy.Like running is running.It sucks.But you have a choice to make.Do you want to sit down and go\nback to that guy you once were?No.So this is what it takes.It takes that\nmisunderstanding of people.And they'll never get it because\nthey were never David Goggins.So that is what it takes\nfor me to do what I do.It may take you\nsomething differently.So for me, everything\nhas to be in the study.Everything has to be into this.Everything has to\nbe in-- everywhereI am it has to be there,\nme, focused where I am.That's why you're\nmy second podcastI've done since Rogan,\nsince the book came out.I don't have time for that shit\nbecause if I want to be great,I'm not trying to maximize money\nor maximize people knowing me.I do these things because\nmaybe someone out there willunderstand me and get it and\nsay, I can grow from this guy,and others just won't.ANDREW HUBERMAN: Sounds\nlike friction is something"

            "text": "DAVID GOGGINS: Love it.ANDREW HUBERMAN:\nBut I think it's onethat you'll appreciate.Most people don't\nknow this, but there'sa brain structure called the\nanterior mid-cingulate cortex.As we pointed out\nbefore, that's a noun.It's a name.It doesn't mean anything.We could call it\nthe Cookie Monster.But what's interesting\nabout this brainarea is there are\nnow a lot of datain humans, not some mouse study,\nshowing that when people dosomething they don't\nwant to do like add threehours of exercise\nper day or per weekor when people who are trying\nto diet and lose weightresist eating something,\nwhen people do anythingthat they, and this\nis the important part,that they don't want to do,\nit's not about adding more work.It's about adding more work\nthat you don't want to do.This brain area gets bigger.Now here's what's especially\ninteresting about this brainarea to me.And by the way, I'm\nonly learning thisrecently because it's new data.But there's a lot of it.The anterior\nmid-cingulate cortexis smaller in obese people.It gets bigger when they diet.It's larger in athletes.It's especially\nlarge or grows largerin people that see\nthemselves as challengedand overcome some challenge.And in people that\nlive a very long time,this area keeps its size.In many ways,\nscientists are startingto think of the anterior\nmid-cingulate cortex not justas one of the seats of\nwillpower but perhaps actuallythe seat of the will to live.DAVID GOGGINS: See,\nnow we're talking.ANDREW HUBERMAN:\nAnd when I learnedabout the anterior\nmid-cingulate cortex,I was like almost\nout of my seat.And I've been in the\nneuroscience gamesince I was 20.DAVID GOGGINS:\nNow we're talking.ANDREW HUBERMAN:\nWe're the same age.And I was so pumped because I've\nheard of the amygdala, fear,prefrontal cortex.It's planning an action.I could tell you every\nbrain area and every--I teach neuroanatomy\nto medical students.But when I started\nseeing the dataon the anterior mid-cingulate\ncortex, I was like, whoa,this is interesting.And all the data\npoint to the factthat we can build this area up.But that as quickly\nas we build it up,if we don't continue to invest\nin things that are hard for us,that we don't want to\ndo-- that's the part thatfeels so Goggin-esque to me,\nthat we don't want to do.Like if you love the ice bath--\nyeah, I love the ice bath--and you go from 1\nminute to 10 minutes,guess what, your anterior\nmid-cingulate cortex did notgrow.DAVID GOGGINS: None.ANDREW HUBERMAN: But if\nyou hate the cold water,if you're afraid of drowning\nand you get into waterand put your head\nunder and survive,then the anterior mid-cingulate\ncortex gets bigger.But if you don't do it the next\nday or if you do it the nextday and you enjoy it because,\nhey, hey, I did it yesterday,woo-hoo, happy me, Merry\nChristmas as you would say--DAVID GOGGINS: Right.Merry Christmas.ANDREW HUBERMAN: --guess\nwhat, the anteriormid-cingulate cortex\nshrinks again.To me, this is one of the\nmost important discoveriesthat neuroscience has\never made because it'sthat I don't want to do\nsomething but do it anywaythat grows this area.And it's almost like--I have a friend.He's been sober 30\nyears from alcohol.And he always says, the\namazing thing about addictionis there's a cure.The problem is it only\nworks one day at a time.And so you have to\nrenew it every day.DAVID GOGGINS: That's right.ANDREW HUBERMAN: So the anterior\nmid-cingulate cortex to me--when I learned about it, two\nthings went off in my head.Whoa, this is super interesting.And, two, I got to tell\nDavid Goggins about this.And I waited until now--DAVID GOGGINS: I'm glad.ANDREW HUBERMAN: --to tell\nyou because I felt like, well,for obvious reasons\nI wanted to tell youand I wanted to tell you here.DAVID GOGGINS: Well, I\nlove that because that'show I've lived my entire life.I don't know\nanything about that.But people go, man, you\nhave such a strong will.It's something that you build.Like I never forget I was\non a podcast one time.And this dude goes you were\nblessed with a strong mind.Like the hell are\nyou talking about Iwas blessed with a strong mind?That's something that\nyou have to develop.You develop that over\nyears, decades of sufferingand going back into the suffer.That's why a lot of people who\ngraduate Navy SEAL training,they want to know--I talk about it very\nopenly all the time.A lot of guys don't want\nto go back into that water,don't want to go back\ninto the hard stuff.And maybe not-- anything\nhard, anything hardin life, once you get through\nit, it's like you become a POW.Like how many POWs you know\nwant to go back to POW camp?None.When something sucks\nso bad in life--this is on this that\nwe're talking about now--very few people want to go back.They're happy they graduated.I realized I'm the same way.I don't want to go back.I have to go back.I must go back because that is\nexactly where all the knowledgeof my life exists was back\nthere in what you're exactlywhat you're talking about.Well, I didn't know\nanything about this.But how I grew a will was\nconstantly doing these thingsto now it's just life.I wake up.While it still sucks,\nit's just life.You don't sit back\nand like, oh my god.Like I have days I\ndon't want to do.But I know I'm going to do it.I know from years\nof just doing it.So that's beautiful.And this is why I came\non here with you today.And I'm glad that you're talking\nabout this because human beingsneed to hear this.They need to stop hearing\nthese hacks on this and that.There's no fucking hack, bro.There's no fucking hack.Yeah, you may this and that\nand saunas and all this shitthat they-- yeah, it's great.There is no fucking life hack.To grow that thing--\nhow do you grow it?Do it, and do it,\nand do it, and do it.That's the hack.The hack is going\nto fucking suck.And that's what I realized.That's what I realized.That's why I wanted\nto come on here today.I

mid-cingulatecortex.DAVID GOGGINS: So\nnow you know whythere's so many people\nthat fail in this worldto figure out their purpose,\ntheir purpose in life.Where do I go?Because to grow that, now,\nyou may not look like me,how my daily life looks.It don't look fun.Don't look fun.So it's a choice that\npeople have to make in life.But what's so funny about it\nis even the richest of rich,who have everything, they\nalways ask me this question.I feel like I'm\nmissing something.I don't feel like\nI'm missing shit.I don't have what you all have.But you will never in\nmy life hear me tell youI'm missing something.And everybody is.They're missing this feeling.I found it a long time ago.And I found it right there\nin that willpower thing.When you're nothing,\nnothing, and change yourselfinto something, like me, you\ncall it happiness, peace,whatever the fuck\nyou want to call it,people are missing exactly what\nwent on with David Goggins.Why don't you smile?I do.I do.But I figured something out.That's why I am never--you never hear me say,\nI'm missing something.I found it years ago.You find it in the suck.You find it in the suck.And you find it repeatedly\nin the suck to the pointwhere you know\nexactly who you are.Most people are\nmissing somethingbecause they don't\nknow who they are.They never examined themselves.They've never done this\nexperiment on themselves.The lab rat.We're all lab rats.But you're also the scientist.You create your own self.Most people are\nmissing somethingbecause there's so\nmuch trapped in there.I don't even want\nto say potential.I think that's a word--\nit's used out too much too.There's so much in you that\nGod or whoever the hellyou believe in or if\nyou're an atheist in youthat you have not unlocked,\nthat you walk aroundwith this gorgeous wife or great\nhusband and all this money.You're like, god, I feel\nlike I'm missing something.Yeah, because it's\nabout 75% of youis still fucking in there, still\nchained up because you justdidn't want to find\nyour willpower,didn't want to find your\nsoul, your will, your heart,your determination,\nyour guts, your courage.And what that looks\nlike, it looks scary,like you're little\nscary lab that went in.Scary to wake up every\nday and say, I'm stupid,but I'm going to\nfigure out a wayto be smarter versus saying,\nman, I just can't do that.So you limit this box.So your box becomes so\nsmall of things you can do.My box wasn't even a box.It was a fucking little pinhole.And then through\nexamining myself,getting some willpower,\nsome courage,it became bigger\nthan this table.But that's what we all do.That's why I wanted to\ncome here today and talkto you about real shit,\nnot no fucking hacks.There's no hacks, bro.It's you against you.You against you.And if you\nmisunderstand that, youhave a real problem,\nreal problem.I can understand\nyou misunderstandme, running down the street,\nshirt off, fuck this, no.Yeah.I can get it.I get it.If you misunderstand what\nI'm saying right now today,the problem is you.And you don't want to fix it.ANDREW HUBERMAN: Well, the\nchildren of wealthy peopleare a case study in how\nnot having enough friction"

            "text": "can destroy a life.DAVID GOGGINS: True statement.ANDREW HUBERMAN: I\nmean, I could list offprominent names in the press.But those are actually\nthe least interesting.What's probably more\ninteresting, as an example,is all the ones we don't\nhear about because we neverhear about them.They just dwindle and wither.Or I think there's this\nbig category of people,I'm realizing, as we have this\nconversation today that they'renot super successful.They're not struggling.They're successful enough\nthat they never have to--you can get to the\npoint where youdon't have to impose friction.You even said it.Your bank account is in a\nplace where you don't reallyneed to do all\nthe things you do,probably not even a\nsmall fraction of them.DAVID GOGGINS: Do nothing.ANDREW HUBERMAN: Right.But you realize the\nstick and being hauntedis the fuel and the engine.And you'd be a-- you'd be\ntruly crazy to give that upbecause you've\ninternalized all that.But most people, they're\ngood enough for them.And so they don't actually\nwant to be better badly enoughin order to start\ngoing rung after rung.DAVID GOGGINS: Well, think\nabout when you build willpower.And think about how\nmuch I've built.Now that you know about this--I didn't know about this.But think about how\nmuch I've built.Everything I've ever done in\nmy life, I didn't want to do.Everything every day.I'm a lazy piece of shit.And I'm one of the hardest\nworking people to ever stepfoot on this planet Earth.And I'm saying that very proudly\nbecause I know what I do.It's not cocky.I'll tell you I'm stupid.And I'll also tell you the exact\nopposite of what I've done.It's the truth.It is the truth.So imagine how much I've\ndeveloped in that time frame.But this is the scary thing.Why most people don't want to\ndo that and build that willpoweris because it is scary.It unlocks a whole bunch\nof things about who you areand who you're not.And a lot of people don't\nwant to go down that journeyto discover who they\nare and who they're notbecause it's not\na pretty journey.I mean, I've gone down it.It's not like I\nwent down it once.I go down it all the time.And when you unlock that-- and\nyou can't just turn it off.Like, people say, hey, how\ncome you haven't retired yet?I built all this willpower.Do you think it's\ngoing to let me justretire because my knees hurt?It is telling me every morning--I wake up, and I'm like,\nman, my knees hurt.My legs hurt.My body hurts.But you can still run.So why aren't you running?If you can still run--there will be a time when you\ncan't lace them up anymore.But you can still run.So I still run.When the time comes I can't\nrun, the body will say,you just can't run.But if I can still\ndo something, thatwillpower that I\nhave created, itmakes me do it\nevery fucking day.And that's what they don't get.What builds a human being is you\nstart with the small buildingblocks.And before you know it,\nman, you become somethingthat it doesn't even\nmake sense to most peoplebecause it's just\nwho you are now.That's why I can still\nrun at 50 with broke--at 49 with broke down\nknees and broke down bodybecause my body\nknows you still can.Therefore, I do.Second you stop, the\nwillpower is gone.And that's beautiful.I'm so glad you brought that to\nme because I always wondered,what's this\nseparation thing now?At 24 years old, I\nstarted building somethingthat I didn't even\nknow was goingto be what it is now at 49.And that's all it was.It was just that.ANDREW HUBERMAN: This structure,\nanterior mid-cingulate cortex,has inputs and outputs\nfrom a bunch of places.But you'll probably not\nbe surprised to learnthat it's strongly activated\nwhen we move our body whenwe don't want to move our body.I feel like it's like the\nDavid Goggins structure.DAVID GOGGINS: It really is.ANDREW HUBERMAN: It is.And it also has\nstrong connectionsto the dopamine reward pathway.And everyone goes,\nyay, dopamine.Everyone loves dopamine.I'm partially responsible\nfor people knowing a bit moreabout dopamine.But dopamine's badly understood.Everyone thinks\ndopamine, dopamine hits.It's about reward.It's about motivation and drive.And there are pain inputs to the\ndopamine centers of the brain.No one talks about that.Everyone's like, oh, you want\nthe chocolate, chocolate, sex,cocaine.Yeah, that's all true.It'll release dopamine.Pain releases dopamine.The anterior\nmid-cingulate cortexcan trigger the release\nof dopamine in responseto this thing that\nwe're calling friction.And that's a learned thing.That's something that\nno animal or human beingcomes into the world learning.We all are averse to pain.And like pleasure,\nlike sugar, fat.Don't like hot surfaces.But this is a\nstructure that learns.It has neuroplasticity,\nthe abilityto change throughout\nthe entire life span.And here's the\npart that I think,again, is just neuro nerd\nspeak for what you already knowand have done and exemplify,\nis that people say,oh, it has plasticity.You can change it.But guess what?It has plasticity\nin both directions.It can grow.But just as easily as it can\ngrow, it's like Silly Putty,it can shrink.So it requires constant upkeep.And that answer isn't one\nthat people are going to like.They're like, give\nme the energy drink.Give me the supplement.Give me the-- give me\nthe sauna protocol that'sgoing to make my anterior\nmid-cingulate cortex-- there'ssomeone out there\nright now who's going,wait, if I took transcranial\nmagnetic stimulationand I stimulate-- yeah, you'd\nprobably-- actually, they'vedone that.They stuck a little\nwire during neurosurgeryinto this structure.This was actually\ndiscovered by a colleagueof mine, Joe Parvizi.Stimulate.And the patients go, I feel\nlike there's a storm coming.And they go, oh, is it scary?And they go, no, I\nwant to go through it.They come off the stimulation,\nand people are like--this is the seat of what\nwe're talking about.DAVID GOGGINS: Right.Exactly.ANDREW HUBERMAN: And it learns.So the fact that you've\nkept this brain structure--I'm convinced if we imaged\nyour brain, it'd be large,and it would be larger\nin two years, in a year.But this is the no days off\nrationale because it can grow,and it can shrink.DAVID GOGGINS: I know.What you're saying right now,\nI didn't know any of this.And I never-- and I\nalways talk to you.But I wish I could\njust put this on paper.And you're saying it in a way\nthat people can understand.I can never put it into\nwords on what I builtand the power that\nis within all of us.But you put it so\nin a scientific way.Most people, for\nme, he's just crazy.That's why I don't like\ntalking about it, man.I know I'm not crazy.I know what I had to do\nto get where I had to go.People look at it as crazy\nbecause there are peoplethat just--if you can't imagine\nyourself doing something,if you can't imagine\nyourself doing something,the person that's\ndoing it is crazybecause in your mind, the logic\nbehind it, it doesn't compute.Therefore, you have to\ngive somebody a title.And the title for me\nis usually he's crazyor he's this, he's that.No.No.For some reason, me\nwanting to be somebodyso fucking bad in my\nlife, I created that.And I've been\ntrying to figure outyears of my life trying\nto explain to people.But even though you're\nexplaining it now,this is the easy fucking part.Them listening to this shit\nis the easy fucking part.The part that why they're\nalways be the ones of onesis because putting\nthat practice,putting that into\nactual work, no, man.No.No.That's where the demons come in.That's where you're like,\nI don't want to be better.I don't want to be better.If this is what it\ntakes to be better,I don't want to be better.So everybody's-- that's why\nthere's a lot of average.And it makes me so fucking mad.Every day I walk this\nEarth, and I see averageall over the fucking place.And they want to ask\nme, how did you do it?I can't tell you how because\nyou're not going to fucking--you're not going to do it.You're not going to do it you.You're just going to--You're going to continue\nbeing like this every dayyou wake up.Like you said, it's\nlike, get the coffee.Make the pancakes.Kiss the girl.Kiss the kids.You wake up, right to work.Immediate, your\nmind is in action.No one wants to do that.No one.And I don't blame them.But don't be mad when\nyou're laying therein your fucking bed, and\nyou're in the fucking hospital,and you're 70, 80, 90 years old.And you're thinking,\nman, I feel like Ididn't fucking do something.Because you did.You didn't do it.You didn't do shit.You may have lived\na great life, man,but you're always going\nto feel empty inside.I don't feel empty.So call me what you want.There's not one empty\nbone in my fucking bodybecause I have figured\nout that really--the magic potion,\nat least to my life.And it's very rewarding.ANDREW HUBERMAN: I'd like\nto take a quick break"

now.And but people tend\nto think about howthe conditions that\nwere around successmust have been part of it.And you can understand why.It's very rational.I was in that situation.I was successful.I'm in this situation.I'm not.That was the past.This is the present.Ergo, capable.You see how people\nget into these loops.And as you mentioned, you spent\nthe first 20 years of your lifein extremely challenged\ncircumstances.And then you can see how\npeople get to a pointwhere everything feels hard.Like, when you're 300 pounds--I haven't ever been 300 pounds.But I can't imagine it feels\ngood to get up and move around.DAVID GOGGINS: It's defeating.ANDREW HUBERMAN: I got a friend.He's in excess of 300 pounds.We've been trying\non him for years.But no win.And he's got crazy psoriasis\non the back of his calves.And he actually\nsmells bad sometimesbecause he can't wash\nas well as he would.He's big, big.And it pulls all my sympathy.But life is very hard for\nhim and getting worse.He's a young guy with\na lot of medical issuesnow, for obvious reasons.And so I think people like that\nthink, well, it's already hard.Why would I make it harder?Your message is a\nlittle different.And you have the\nlife experience.DAVID GOGGINS: It's\na lot different.ANDREW HUBERMAN:\nYou've been there.So for me, saying, oh\nyeah, lose weight--I was a skinny guy who got\nto be a less skinny guy.So I don't really have\na foot to stand on.What do you say to those\npeople who are like,listen, getting up in\nthe morning is hard.Trying to not dissolve into\na puddle of my own tearsand my own misery is hard.DAVID GOGGINS: You know why\npeople connect with my booksso well?For some reason, God put me\nin almost every fucked upsituation on the planet Earth.So when I talk to people,\nit's not sugar-coatedbecause I'm not saying it from I\nwas a 175 pounds my whole life.I don't say much\nto those people.Maybe you're a piece of shit.Maybe you want to be nobody.Maybe you're happy exactly\nwhere you are in lifebecause obviously, you are.Maybe you don't have\nthe determinationto be somebody better\nthan who you are.And if you want to live with\nthat, I'll support you in that.If you're good with being who\nyou are, that every day youwake up, and every day, you\nsmell like shit because youcan't wash your body well,\nand your skin is messed upbecause your health's\nso bad, and youcan't put your clothes on\nright, you need help with that.You need help like--\nwhen I was 300 pounds,I needed help wiping my ass.That makes you feel good?Nothing I can say to you.If every day you wake up with\nthis-- see, people are haunted.But they obviously\nlike horror filmsbecause they keep watching\nthe same fucking movie.I don't like horror films.A lot of people\nlike horror films.So I don't say much to them.I say exactly what I\nsaid to you right therebecause I was once you.I didn't like horror\nfilms, so I changed it.Some people are just--they become-- like you\nsaid, it gets real smallwhen you're lazy and\nyou're fat, your will.Their will is so small\nthat they don't have any.And you can't give it to them.There has to be\nsomething-- this iswhat I'm talking about now\nbecause this isn't a hack.This has to be in you.Something in you has to wake up.And usually, the only person\nthat can wake it up is you.Sometimes you can read\na David Goggins bookbecause I was all this shit and\nthen a lot more of fucked up.But if you don't have a\nlittle flame, just barely--you're done.I can't light it for you.And that's the harsh\nreality of this lifethat I want to get\nacross so fucking bad.You can watch me.You can watch you.You can watch fucking\nRogan and CameronHanes, all these motherfuckers.You can go to Tony\nRobbins's fucking bullshit,all this shit.You can do all this shit.You're going to keep\ngoing back and keepspending money and\nspending money and spendingmoney with no results.You're going to wonder, wow.Maybe let me go try\nout David Goggins.He ain't going to\nfucking help you.You have to explore, examine\nthe insides of yourself.And what do you really\nwant out of life?Your friend and a lot\nof people out herejust don't fucking want it.So guess what?Have fun with your life.Go from 300 to 350\nto 400 to 450 to 500because you don't want it.And that's the harsh reality.I can't give you shit.You can't give them shit.We can give you ideas.But end of the day, when\nI was losing the weight,I had to miserably wake up\nevery morning in the coldbecause it was Indiana,\nNovember, when it started.I was miserable.This is your new life.Take it or leave it.There's no happiness about it.There's no peace behind it.It sucks.It just fucking sucks.And that's the one thing, if I\ncould teach anybody anything,it just fucking sucks.And it's going to\ncontinue to suck.And then one day, you'll get\nto a special part in your lifethat it might get a\nlittle bit better.But to lose the weight you\nhave to lose, my friend, sorry.It's going to suck every\nfucking day because then whenyou're 300 pounds, you're\ngoing to go out to lose weight,you could probably get injured.So then you got to\nwork on the injury.And then you get\neven more depressed.This is what I went through.And then you're hungry\nbecause now you're depressed.It's just a vicious cycle.And if you're not\nstrong mentallyand you have no\nwillpower, you'regoing to continue\nfalling back in this holeversus the man that\nsits back and goes,all right, motherfucker.This is why I cuss because\nthis is what is in me.This is what it took\nfor me to be me.Sorry.It didn't take, hey, OK,\nwe're going to do this today.No.This fucking really sucks.This is real, dude.This is real.And every day, I'm set back.I'm set back.I'm set back.I'm set back.So this is what I\nwould tell your boy.This is exactly\nwhat I'd tell him.Every day you wake up,\nyou're going to probablybe set back for the\nfirst four weeksbefore you lose significant\nweight because the mind isgoing to be fucking\nwith you the whole time.There's no dopamine.There's no dopamine in\nthere at 300 pounds.You got nothing.Your hormones are shot.You have to envision something\nthat is more powerful than you.Something has to\nget you out of bed.And you have to create it.It has to be false\nbecause you're not it.You're a fat piece of shit.And that's the reality of it.So you have to create a false\nreality, to live in thatjust to get to work on yourself.That's the reality.ANDREW HUBERMAN: He'll\nsee this, and he'llappreciate that message.We'll see what he does.DAVID GOGGINS: We'll see.ANDREW HUBERMAN: So far, last\n13 years, it's been no movement.But I have had other\nfriends who weredrug and alcohol addicts who\nquit after one conversation.Never went back.DAVID GOGGINS: That's awesome.That means they want it.ANDREW HUBERMAN: Yeah, just\none guy, I won't out him,but walked up to me at a\nparty in 2019, July 4th party,and said, I'm a pile.And I go, what?And he goes, I'm a pile.Look at me.I'm 60 pounds overweight.And I go, do you drink?He goes, every day.I go, how much?He goes, a case.He goes, I smoke a lot of weed.But he's successful in\nother areas of his life.And so I said, well,\nhere's what I know.Quit alcohol and weed for you.I'm not telling\npeople what to do.Don't eat until 2:00 PM.Get on an exercise\nbike, and pedalin the morning like someone's\nchasing you with a poison dartuntil you want to puke.And I was kind of half-joking.And then two months\nlater, he was, like,I haven't had a drink.I lost 30 pounds.He lost those 60 pounds.He never went back.Now, he's super fit.It's amazing.So some people flip the switch.He is very\nself-critical by nature."

you doing it?ANDREW HUBERMAN: And I'm\ntalking about myself now.Those modes of just kind\nof passive consumption,they're so easy to wash over us.I used to have this thing,\nand I'm fighting thisnow because I knew we were\ngoing to have this conversationtoday, where I like\nto start thingson the hour or the half hour.Worst practice in\nthe world for mebecause if I miss that half\nhour, I'm like, oh, it's 12:33.I'll start at 12:45.Ah, it's 12:45.I'll start at 1:00.I just lost time.And so this is so stupid.And the other day,\nI was like, man, Igot to tell David about this\nbecause my new thing is I startno matter what time it is.If I wake up in the\nmiddle of the night--I got a friend.He paints in the\nmiddle of the night.I'm like, you're an insomniac?He's like, I don't know.I just do it.Then sometimes he\ngoes back to sleep.Sometimes he doesn't.Everyone's got their thing.But I thought about this.I'm like, no more am I\ngoing to say I'm startingat 1:00 because I know me.If I miss the 1:00 ding and then\nmy pen's not hitting the paperor I'm not typing\non the keyboard,I'm not going to do it.But That's a\nself-admitted weakness.DAVID GOGGINS: I love it, man.I had that for a lot of years.I know I'm going to do it.That's the haunting part is\nthat it's going to happen.It has to happen.And that's a fact.Like, there's no get out\nof jail free card, bro.None.Like, that is a life\nthat I don't know.I don't have that ability.Or I have the ability.I don't have the--I'm not good enough,\nsmart enough.I'm not talented\nenough to do that.Some people are.Some people can start at 1:00.Some people don't\nhave to start at all.If you lack talent, you\ncan't sit back and say,I'll start in half an hour.I can't do that.I got to start now.And after I get back from\nstarting, I got to start again.And then when I get done with\nthat run or that study session,if it wasn't good enough,\nI got to go back againbecause repetition is\nwhat taught me everything.So you can honestly\noutwork anything.But it's that you, obviously,\nare a very talented man.ANDREW HUBERMAN: Well, I have\nworked hard at certain thingsand built up some\nthings that I'vebeen good at most of my life.DAVID GOGGINS: You're amazing.ANDREW HUBERMAN: Gathering,\norganizing, and disseminatinginformation's\nsomething I've beendoing since I was a little kid.I used to give lectures at\nschool on Monday about stuffI learned over the weekend.DAVID GOGGINS: See,\ncheck that out.ANDREW HUBERMAN: But they\ntook me to a psychiatrist.We're the same age.Back then, if you got\nsent to a psychiatrist,people thought you were crazy.DAVID GOGGINS: I was one.ANDREW HUBERMAN: Yeah, exactly.DAVID GOGGINS: I was one.ANDREW HUBERMAN: Exactly.So I remember\nfeeling like a freak.Also, I didn't have a stutter,\nbut I had a grunting tic.It comes back when I'm tired.And the only thing that\nhelped that was hittingmy head on something,\nshaking my head,which is why skateboarding\nwas good because I'd slam,and I'd feel like, oh.I feel good.But that's not healthy.That's not good.Or just work.Work is what gets it out.It's like an-- it's\nlike an RPM or high.[REVVING SOUND]\nAnyway, that's me.But yeah, I think\ncertain things over time,I feel like talent or gifts or\nwhatever you want to call them,but there are many\nthings that areexceedingly difficult for me.And I have learned\nfrom your example.I know that you are very\nboth humble and very clearthat you don't have--\nyou say, you'renot going to get it\nby examining you.But I think the way\nyou're sharing todayand the way you've shared\nit on other podcasts before,there are pieces\nthat really helppeople feel into\nthe process of whatyou're talking about today.We're elaborating on it, I\nthink, a lot, this notionof being haunted and the stick.I mean, of course, of course,\nnow it makes so much sense whyyou don't want to talk about\nsleep or rest or recoverybecause that's--sure, that's important.I've heard you say,\nyes, you sleep.Yes, you eat.Yes, you hydrate.Yes, you will stretch\nyour psoas or whatever.But it's funny how that\nbecomes the viral message.DAVID GOGGINS: That's why\nI said fuck that today.ANDREW HUBERMAN: But\nthat's not the unique--that's not the unique\nmessage that you carry.Like, anyone can\ntalk about that.So do I have that right?That you're acknowledging\nsleep is important.Recovery is important.DAVID GOGGINS: Yes.ANDREW HUBERMAN: But that's\nnot what you're about.DAVID GOGGINS: You have\nto forego something.Yes.Ice baths.Saunas.Sleep.Nutrition.All this shit's so\nfucking important, dude.I don't have time\nfor some of it.To extract what I had to\nextract, something had to give.Like, you talk about you\nwhen you were younger.You would give these\nspeeches and stuff.The same age you\nwere giving speeches,I was trying to figure out how\nto say the without stuttering.And I realized, as I got older,\nthat all these things areimportant.But for me to stop\nstuttering, I gotto build fucking confidence.And speech therapy\ndidn't help that.Nothing helped that.I have to forgo a lot of\nshit to be as fucked upas I am to build\nconfidence, for meto stand in a fucking room of\n10,000-- of one person, and not[STUTTERING SOUNDS] and be\nlike, oh, and put my head down.Let me look around.Let me read these\nparagraphs first.And then before I\nread the paragraphs,because they're\ncalling me next, letme just leave the room\nbecause I'm going to stutter.That's a miserable life.And that's one of many\nthings I did besides lying,besides being insecure,\nbesides being immature,besides being fat, besides\nbeing one of the only Black kidsin my school.There's a lot of things I had\nto overcome to gain confidence.And in doing so, a\nlot of that had to go.A lot of it.So I became the guy that became,\nonce again, misunderstood.You only sleep four hours\na day, two hours a day?Sometimes you\ndon't sleep at all?Like, what's this, and\nwhat's this, and what's this?I know it's all important.I can't.Something's got to go.For me to get confidence,\nbecause confidenceis the building block of\nwhere I'm trying to go,for me to gain\nconfidence in myself,this fucked up kid has got\nto do a lot of fucked up shitto gain confidence.And along the way,\nthe stutter went away.And I gained confidence.And now, my life is\na little bit more--there is no balance.There is no balance.It's a little bit more what it\nshould be for a lot of people.But there'll never be balance\nbecause confidence is somethingthat you're constantly--confidence and belief\nyou're building every day.And so something's got to give.And I'm willing to\nforego a lot of thingsto have that because\nI know if youwant to give\nsomebody kryptonite,take that shit away from them.So yeah, I don't\nsleep sometimes.And sometimes I don't\neat the right way.And sometimes I don't do this\nand do that and whatever, man.But you put me in a room\nof 10,000 people any timeof the day, and I'll\nwalk in there thinkingI'm the baddest\nmotherfucker in herebecause I know what it\ntook to be on this stage.And a lot of people\nwould not do that.So that's what it takes.ANDREW HUBERMAN:\nThere's a questionI've been wanting to ask\nyou since we started."

            "text": "And I thought about\ncoming in here.And I've been thinking about\nin the weeks ahead of this.And I'm going to just come\nclean and say I don't exactlyknow how to ask the question.DAVID GOGGINS: Just ask it.ANDREW HUBERMAN: It's\nabout relationships.DAVID GOGGINS: Oh, do it, man.ANDREW HUBERMAN:\nSo I know in myselfthat my discipline is much\nhigher when it's just me.But that's because I had\ncertain things early on.But then I was a\nterrible student.Barely finished high school.But then when I got\nserious, I got serious.But I did that by staying\naway from everybody.And anyone's who's ever had\na relationship of any kind,but in particular,\nromantic relationships,knows that, yes, you can derive\ntremendous support from those.Like, you got this, baby.You can go.And you're like, yeah.I got this.She said I got this.Feels great to finish something\nand share with someone,share a meal, get the hug.But there's another\nside to all of thatthat I'd like to learn\nmore about from you,which is there's a\nwarm body next to youin bed in the morning.You don't want to get up.They also have needs.You've got your mission\nthat people sometimesneed things from us.But also, oftentimes,\nthe people thatlove us most, that truly love\nus and that want to support us,don't understand this thing.And they're the first people\nto tell us, like, listen.Take a day off.And then this whole cycle,\nat least in my head,goes off, like, you\njust want a vacation.And then it's almost\nlike a paranoia.I'm not saying anything\nnice about myself right now.DAVID GOGGINS: All good, man.ANDREW HUBERMAN:\nFormer girlfriendsare going to be like, yeah.Like, they remember that.And so support of people\nclose to you is critical.This could be friends.Could be romantic partners.Whatever.But they're also-- the\nknife cuts both ways.It can be the thing\nthat can reallyundermine this thing that you're\ntalking about because peoplethat care about us also\nwant to see us comfortable.They want to see us happy.They want to see us peaceful.They want to see us wake up\nfrom a great night's sleep.And they want things too.So how do you untangle\nthat whole bit?DAVID GOGGINS: Well,\nit's funny, man.I'm unbalanced, but\nI'm mostly unbalancedtowards the family side, which\npeople don't get about me.I'll start being unbalanced.I get all my stuff in.But what I do is I make sure\nthat my family has everythingthey need, everything\nthey need, those whowant to be part of my family.Some don't.Some family members don't want\nto be part of David Goggins.I get it.I got it.That's life.Those who are part\nof my family, Igive them everything\nthey need so theycan leave me the fuck alone.I make sure you're happy as fuck\nbecause I got to go to work.And I don't mean smokejumping.I don't mean running.I mean all of it.It takes every--I can't have you\nin my fucking shit.I can't.So I know for me\nto have a family,I gotta make sure that you\nrealize I'm going to give youeverything you need.So when you start\nbitching at me,I'm going to say, look, hang on.I dedicated my life to give\nyou everything you need.I need this time\nright here for meto be the best I can be\nbecause this journey startedwithout anybody.And I make sure everybody knows\nthat who comes in my life.I've been left-- think about it.I was left alone at a young\nage to figure this shit out.I figured it out for myself\nand have been very successfulfor myself.No one's going to come in\nhere and fuck with my shit.That's why I make sure I will\ntake care of whatever you need.Whatever you need\nfrom me, you got it.Money, house, my\nlove, my support,I'm going to give you\neverything you need.That said, I do it the\nhighest level possible.And I'm saying that with\nJennifer in the next room.So please come here\nand say somethingif it's wrong, Jennifer.I don't give a fuck.Say what you got to say.So then when it's time\nfor me to go to work,I expect you to\ndo the same for mebecause it takes every bit of\nme to do what I have to do.So I make sure that I'm very\nunbalanced from my familyso I can be exactly that\nunbalanced for myself.And that's how I do it.I let people know\nright up front,I'm not what you want in a man.I guarantee that.There's going to be\na lot of late nights,a lot of early\nmornings, a lot of timeswhere I got to be by myself\nthinking about the process thatis next in my mind.I can't have aggravation.I can't have this.Can't have that.There's a lot of things.But I let them know up front.I'm very vocal about that.Sometimes relationships\nwork for me.Sometimes they didn't.But that's who I am.One thing I did wrong in my life\nwas I tried for so many yearsto please people.And I did it at the\nexpense of myself.I was leaving a lot in the tank.And when you do that,\nyou stop living.But the person in your\nlife is happy as fuckbecause you're giving\nthem everything they want.They have their--\ntheir life is full.But you feel empty.And that's not a\nrelationship to me.So for me, it's\nimportant that youknow exactly who I am because\nthis is what life made.And I'm not trying to change it\nbecause I just figured it out.So I'm not trying to\ncompromise David Goggins.I would never, ever\ncompromise David Goggins.That doesn't mean I won't\ngive you what you needand what you want\nand what you desire.But I don't need money.I don't need fame.I don't need shit.So I give it all away.What I do need is to make sure\nthat that willpower is workedon every fucking day and every\nnight for the rest of my lifebecause that's the\none thing that'sgoing to keep me feeding you,\nkeeping you where you needto be, because once\nthat willpower is gone,300-pound David Goggins,\nhe may not look like it,but I will walk around with it.So the things that are\nimportant to you in life,you must do always.Or you're nobody.And that's how I\nhandle relationships.ANDREW HUBERMAN: Amen to that.Something I could\npersonally work onis that upfront,\nclear communicationbecause it resonates that\nfeeling of there's somethinginside that's not getting worked\nout that, when I'm on my own,it's a lot easier.But then, of course, wanting\nrelationships and family,I think that's a healthy\npart of being human too.And obviously,\nyou've worked it out.So I appreciate\nyou sharing that.I don't think I've\never heard youtalk about it that way before.DAVID GOGGINS: People are\nscared of that conversationwith their wife, husband,\ngirlfriend, boyfriend.But why are you scared of it?Why are you scared to tell\na motherfucker, your wife,your husband, who you are, who\nyou are, exactly who you are?And that was the problem\nI had-- that's a problemthat a lot of us have in life.No one knows who you really are.No one knew who I really was.I went to a school where there\nwere a lot of Black kids.A lot of Black kids didn't\nwant to be in special ops.I never talked about\nspecial ops to Black kids.Why?I was wondering what--I'm not going to fit in.That's not what they do.A lot of Black kids don't\ndo that kind of shit.So whatever I wanted\nto do, no one reallyknew the real me growing up\nbecause I never wanted anybodyto know the real me.I was always afraid\nof what you might sayor how you're going\nto feel or whatever.You got feelings.You have a life that\nyou have to live.So it's important that\nwhatever's on your mind,you let that person know.Therefore, you're\ngiving them the optionto be with you or not.This is who I am.If you don't like\nit, that's good, man.I got it.But this is David Goggins.So that honest conversation\nis very important, man,so everybody knows\nwhere they stand.That person may not be for you.And that's all good.ANDREW HUBERMAN:\nThis world could"

up.And you're just like, yeah.But you've talked about\nthis before in referenceto the SEAL Teams.We both know a lot of\npeople in that community.And the Teams component is a big\npart of it for a lot of people.And it's a wonderful thing.But there's a danger\nto that dopamine hit,for lack of a better\nway to put it,from we can only derive when\nit's coming from the outside.You're talking about being\nable to either say, good job,but also, just look to one's\nown personal history and say,I've done hard things.And I can do it again and again\nbecause I do it again and againand again.You're talking about parenting\nyourself, inspiring yourself,scaring yourself, all\nof that from the inside.So very different\nthan the way we'reraised, which is to figure\nout how to get the biscuit.DAVID GOGGINS: It's funny, man.People want to know how\nI'm always motivated.It's the unseen work, which you\njust said is a true statement.Those are false dopamine\nhits that peopleare giving you, man.There's no belief in that.These are teamwork\ndopamine-- like, I'm outrunning at 2 o'clock\nin the morning, 1o'clock in the morning in the\ngym, long sessions by myself.That's real.I'm able to extract dopamine,\nthe good dopamine wheneverI want.Man, I've trained\n99% of my life alone.No one patted me on the back.I did all of the work alone.And while I'm still hard on\nmyself, I know what I did.So whenever times\nget bad for me,people are all this, who's going\nto carry the boats and lo--that's real.I hate that people\nknow me for that guybecause that guy is\nnot every fucking day.When they see me,\nthey want that energy.That's not me every day.I can extract it\nimmediately when I need tobecause when you train alone--and I lived alone for so\nmany years in this misery.And you're able to\nget out by yourself.I can take myself to such\na level of real passionand purpose.And the feeling I\nget is somethingI can't even explain by mys--I don't need anyone.That's why people come\nto me to motivate them.No one can motivate me.I have a resume full\nof fucking motivationthat whenever I'm down, I'm\nlike, oh hang on, motherfucker.Oh, you know the truth.You know the truth.You know the darkness\nof the fucking dungeonsand the fucking demons that fly.And then from there,\nit's like, OK.You were there.You know this.There was no one\nthere to pick upthe rucksack, to pick\nup the boat, to pick upthe log, to go in there.It was you.It was you.There was no pat on the fucking\nback at 300, at 275, at 250,at 220.No.That was you.So those things\nthat come out of me,that extract from me\nin the darkness, peopleare looking for that\npat on the back.Where is it?Oh, I don't need it\nbecause what I've doneis in the fucking unseen work.I built Frankenstein.So whenever shit gets\nnasty, David Gogginsgoes, you had nobody\nanyway, motherfucker.So see how I'm talking\nto myself right now?That's me.That's shit fires\nme the fuck up.That shit makes me fucking nuts.You had nobody\nanyway, motherfucker.Look around you.There was no fucking team.It was you.There was no weight loss program\nor mom and dad waking you up,saying you can do it, you can be\nbetter, trying to build belief.You built belief\nwhen you had nothing.Rock bottom.You did that.So as times get hard for\nme, the truth comes out.And my truth is\npowerful as fuck.It's real.It's tangible.I feel it.It comes out of my brain\nas I speak about it.I'm reliving every single dark\nmoment of my life to be here.So that is what\npeople don't get.That is what motivates David\nGoggins is the unseen work.But everybody needs\nthat pat on the back.They need that training partner.They need that\naccountability coach.I don't need that shit.And neither do they.But it's what we've\ntrained ourselvesto believe that we need.ANDREW HUBERMAN: It's\nalmost like there'sthis pill on the shelf.I'm speaking in analogy.And we take it, and\nwe get jazzed up.And we're like, yeah.But there's this other\nmedicine cabinet behind there.And it's in us.You're saying the real\nmedicine cabinet is inside.DAVID GOGGINS: Oh, yes.When you continue to overcome--and I had so many\nobstacles to overcome.So it's actually\na benefit to me.But the benefit, it's not\nlike a benefit like that.You have to have the\ncourage and the patienceto overcome and overcome.Before you know it, man, you\nhave a whole medicine cabinet.But there's no medicine\nin the motherfucker.There's no pre-workout.I don't take none of that shit.All I got to do\nis flip my brain.Put my finger in there and\nsay, OK, that's a good one.It's all I got to do, man.I got the Rolodex.I'm just like, go fuck\nyourself, Goggins.And oh, but you won.Let's do that one today.There's nothing I need.And this is the\nthing that peopledon't get about David Goggins.I can't teach it in\na 1-minute video.We all have this ability to\nhave our own medicine cabinet.But unless you go in there\nand put the medicine in there,it's always going to\nbe fucking empty, man.You're always going to\nneed the pre-workout.You're always\ngoing to need the--I don't drink coffee.I don't do ca--I don't do none of that.I don't need it.I can run for 70 hours, and\nI have before, no caffeine.I got all this wonderful shit\nthat I overcame on my own,by myself, in the darkness,\nthat, man, when it's cold,I'm hot.When it's hot--I can feed myself all the time.That's why when people\nsay, man, why aren't youmissing anything, I can't\nexplain it to you, man.Can't explain it to you.You'll never understand.That's why I don't do\nall these podcasts, dude.I love you, man.That's why you-- my first\nbook, you did a blurb for me.That's why I'm here.I love what you're\ndoing for people, man.But I can't explain this.I can't.I can't explain this because\npeople don't want to do this.They don't want to do this, man.But I don't know, man.I get jazzed up even\ntalking about it,man, because so many people\nthink my life is just so, ohgod, his

put myself\nin the partially category.DAVID GOGGINS: Big time.ANDREW HUBERMAN:\nBecause I thoughtit was about just forward\ncenter of mass, carrot, carrot,carrot, carrot.But it's the stick.DAVID GOGGINS: It's the stick.ANDREW HUBERMAN: And\nit's being haunted.And you know, I do have examples\nfrom my own life, which is notwhat today is about,\nabout being really afraidand then turning things around.My biggest fear is\ngetting comfortable.I do not have as much of\na stick-oriented approach.But today's conversation's\nchanging the way I think.I'm not going to\nstep away from thisand think, OK, there are\n25 neural circuits thatcan explain 10 of the things\nthat David's talking about.And what I'm thinking\nabout is the factthat everybody has a brain.They have a mind.Forget the brain.The brain's just the\nphysical structure.But what that manifests, what\nthat creates is the mind.And everybody has that.So I do believe that\neveryone has the capacityto do what you're talking\nabout at some level.I also will be the\nfirst to confessthat I think you\nare highly unusual.Let's just say maybe even n\nof 1, as we say in science.Sample size of one.Somebody who has created\nthis process for themselvesand keeps them in\nthis-- themselvesin this forward center\nof mass with the stickbattering the back of\ntheir head all the time.Highly unusual.But this internal\nmedicine cabinetthat you're talking\nabout building up,true confidence, not needing\nanything from the outside,I like to think that\npeople want that.They want to be known.They're afraid.But that they want to be\nknown for who they really areand that you're describing\nthe path to do this.And I will say I'm immensely\ngrateful that you'retalking to us this\nway today about thingsthat you've talked about before.But we're hitting it a little\ndifferently, I like to think.DAVID GOGGINS: Very differently.ANDREW HUBERMAN: Because\nwhat you're talking aboutis a process.It's verbs.It's all verbs.DAVID GOGGINS: All action.ANDREW HUBERMAN: And\nit's not about success.It's more, actually,\nabout keepingthat friction dialed to 10.And no energy drink,\nno supplement.People often misunderstand me.They think-- like, I'm big\non people getting sunlightin the morning so they\nset their circadian rhythmand get better sleep and\nso they can-- et cetera.But then people always\nthink-- they go straightto the supplements.What should I take?And then, of\ncourse, people thinkI'm all about supplements.And supplements are\none piece for me.But it's like tiny fraction\ncompared to the doing,the do's and don'ts.DAVID GOGGINS:\nThat's why I didn'twant to talk about that today.That's why I'm glad\nwe're talking about this.This is it.This is it.Like, the brain is the most\npowerful weapon in the world.And it's crazy how a kid\nthat wasn't real smart,I was forced to\ngo only internal.External had to go away.The external world\nhad to go away.In living so deep inside\nmyself, it was me in this brainand figuring out how\nthis thing works.And so many people are doing\nexactly that, the supplements,the this, the that.And I agree, it helps.But once you figure\nout your brain,you become unstoppable\nto almost anything.Yeah, you can't beat death.You can't whatever, whatever.Your brain is amazing.Once you feed it the right\nconversation, the right mentalnutrients, the right\nmental supplements,the right internal\ndialogue at the right timewith the right hit, with the\nright proof of what you'vedone in the past, and\nyou send that rightto the right circuit, dude,\nyou're a fucking beast.A beast.But once again, you just\ncan't read about it.You can't sit back\nand be a theorist.You have to be a\nfucking practitioner.And in that practice is where\nthat becomes proof-positiveof what I'm saying.It's like, god, David\nGoggins is blowing my mind.What is this?He's not crazy.And so many people,\na lot of people,have listened to\nme the right way.And they come back, and they're\nlike, I'm totally on board.It happened.It happened.I'm like, it'll keep going,\nman, if you keep doing it.But that is it, man.There's no sun.There's no glory.There's no carrot.There's no victory.But there is all of it in one.I just can't explain it\nreal well to people, man.But what you get the\nother end is somethingthat you're always found.You're never lost anymore.Doesn't mean the\njourney is easy.Doesn't get any easier.But you're always found.ANDREW HUBERMAN: I love that.I just want to hover\non that for a secthe same way we hovered\non haunted and the stick.I think people feel lost.I've certainly felt lost at\ntimes in my life, many times.And yeah, there's that thing.I don't think there's a\nneuroscience or a psychologyterm for it.Someone will put it in the\ncomments and say, oh yeah,that's what so-and-so said.But like you said, we're not\ntrying to be theoretical here.We're trying to be practical.The business of finding\nyourself and knowing, oh.But it's sort of like I'm\nsafe because I'm in danger,and I've been in danger\nbefore, and I got myself out.It always seems to\ncome back to verbs.Again, I don't have\na language for this.For once, I'm lost for words.There's like-- it's about\na process, the algorithm.And the reason-- here, I'm just\nkind of trying to make sureI'm understanding\nthings correctly.One of the reasons why\nit must be uncomfortablefor you to be who\nyou are publiclyis because people want to focus\non the running or the swearing.And by the way, the\nswearing is welcome.I'll tell you, I came\nup through laboratorieswhere all three people I\nworked for swore a lot.But there was one rule.I couldn't swear at people.So my graduate advisor,\nbrilliant woman,unfortunately, she died\nearly, they all died early--I'm the common denominator.I had that internalized\nfor a long time.Anyway, she said, but if you\nswear at people, you're out.But you can swear\nas much as you want.So that's the rule I have.It's like, you can swear\nas much as you want.Just don't swear at people.And if you swear at people,\nbetter be ready to fight.Definitely not\ngoing to fight you.So you can swear at\nme, get away with it.But the fact of the\nmatter is that it mustbe frustrating that people--because I know\npeople go, oh, it'sall about supplements\nand ice baths.Listen, I like supplements.I love supplements\nand ice baths.But that's not the full picture.It's just a gravitational pull.It's the swearing.It's the running.It's his feet that\nare all messed up.It's the fact that\nhe got a Triton.He's a SEAL guy.Talk about that too.And there's a gravitational\npull for people.And they're missing-- that's\nthe tip of the iceberg,is what I'm realizing.I'm realizing that\ntoday thanks to the wayyou're phrasing things\nbecause the bigger vesselis all in here.And as you said, how do\nyou put that in a book?DAVID GOGGINS: It's impossible.ANDREW HUBERMAN: Because\nit's highly individual.You do it your way.And you're saying,\neveryone needsto go figure out how to\ndo it their way for them.DAVID GOGGINS: Yes.And the thing about\nbeing misunderstood,it's very frustrating, more\nthan I can even imagine."

mean, whatever they're doing\nis pretty feeble, in my mind.I mean, it's like cap\ngun fire, it that.DAVID GOGGINS: Very feeble.ANDREW HUBERMAN: So many of us,\nmen and women, old and young,hear

HUBERMAN: But\nit's more comfortablefor people, even\nhigh achievers--DAVID GOGGINS: Especially\nhigh achievers.ANDREW HUBERMAN: --to\nbelieve that if youtook one thing away, that\nit would all go away.It's absolutely clear that's\nnot the case with you.I'm 100% convinced.I just know that because\nwe're talking about this.DAVID GOGGINS: Do you\nknow how many timesI haven't been able to run?Two heart surgeries.Multiple knee surgeries.And after every knee\nsurgery, they said,you're not going to run again.And I'm fine with that.There's no running up here, bro.None.This was what it was all about.That's what they lost.What if you can't run?Give a fuck.It was never about running.Why do you think I run?It's the worst thing.I hate doing it\nmore than anything.Hence the willpower.ANDREW HUBERMAN: Right.Your anterior\nmid-cingulate cortexDAVID GOGGINS:\nHence the willpower.ANDREW HUBERMAN:\n--would start to regressif you loved running.DAVID GOGGINS: Think about it.Every day, I wake up.I don't just run\na mile, two miles.It's the one thing I\nhate the most to do.And I do it like I love it.250, 260, 300-mile\nruns at one time.No sleep.And every step, when I get\nto the-- think about this.I get to the fucking start\nline cussing at Jennifer.Why the fuck am I here?I hate this shit.After 70-some hours of\nrunning, every fuckingquestion I ever had is answered.Every question I\nhad is answered.I capped success.People go, what do you\nmean, you capped success?For me to be who I am--so when I go smokejump, I smoke\njump three to four months outof the year, sometimes five.ANDREW HUBERMAN: Could\nyou, just for thosethat aren't educated\nabout-- justgive us a brief description\nof what smokejumping entails.DAVID GOGGINS: So basically,\nyou jump into fires.Not into them, but you jump by\nfires that people can't get to.ANDREW HUBERMAN: So out\nof planes and helicopters.DAVID GOGGINS:\nRight, out of planes.I parachute.It's all parachuting.So you parachute\nout of airplanes.And then you fight the fire, you\nand sometimes four other guysor maybe eight other\nguys, guys and gals.And you're putting\nthis fire out.So I lose millions of dollars\nevery summer to do this.It blows people's minds.Why the hell are you doing this?ANDREW HUBERMAN: And\nyou're breathing soot.DAVID GOGGINS: I'm\nbreathing soot.Knees are jacked up.Hitting the ground.Hurting.Whatever.Talking to normal people,\nthey'll never get it,so I don't even\nexplain it to them.But this is why-- this is\nwhy I call it capped success.I'm talking financial success.For me to continue having that\nwillpower, the second I justbecome a speaking\nmonkey and travel aroundand speaking gigs 12\nmonths out of the year,put camps on, do this, put on\nlectures, get supplement linesand do this and write\nmore books and shit,I've ruined the exact thing\nI worked on my entire life.And while I didn't\nknow it until the day,but something\nalways told me, thisis a very, very, very\nperishable skill, this willpowerthat you have, because I do have\na willpower that I have neverseen in anybody in my life.It is a haunting force\nthat just keeps me going.And I know that\nthat is my strength.If you have that-- so that's\nworth every dime I've evermade in my life is the fact\nI can look a man in the eyefinally and have a\nreal conversationwithout going like\nthis because I'm lying,or I'm a piece of shit.Or I know-- you\nknow how a person--and so many people do this shit.They're talking to you\non who they want to be.They're lying to you.And they walk away--I've done it so many times.You walk away like, god, man.If I could just\ntell them the truth.Why the hell can't I\njust tell him the truth?Know how good it\nfeels for me nowto look at you in\nyour eye and every manI see because women\nwon't get this.Women will not get this.Man to man, that\nman shit, when youlook another man\nin the eye, and youknow that everything you're\nfucking saying is real,and it comes from a real\nworking place, somethingthat you earned, it's the\nbest feeling in the world.ANDREW HUBERMAN: You can\nsay that actually happened.Like, I know with certainty what\nI'm saying actually happened.DAVID GOGGINS:\nActually happened.Who I am and who\nI say I am, I am.No more lies.No more skirting the truth.No more bullshit.And that is worth every dime\nI've ever made in my life.And I swear to God on that.Every dime I've ever made in\nmy life, building who I built,so I capped success\nbecause I knowthat if I ever go 12\nmonths out of the yearand don't put several--\nevery day, I'm going at it.But several months\nout of the year,I go right back to\nground zero, which meansI'm just fucking David Goggins.No Goggins.No carry boats,\nfucking logs bullshit.It's just pick up that\nfucking Pulaski and dig.Hey, get that fucking pump.Walk down a mile.Put it in the fucking water.Mosquitoes beating--\nyou're just David Goggins.You're nobody because\nthat's where my growth is.That's where my\nwillpower comes from.And that's where it stays.That's why when I talk to\nyou now-- and can't nobodytalk like this, dude.People don't talk with\nthis kind of passionbecause it ain't there.It ain't there.They're regurgitating some\nshit from 30 fucking years ago.I'm regurgitating\nshit from an hour ago.Hour ago.Come on, man.It's just be real.And I can't be on\nthese podcasts.I can't talk to anybody\nwithout being real.I'll go away.I'll just go away\nbecause I can't give youwhat I want to give you.ANDREW HUBERMAN: You\nsaid perishable skill."

            "text": "I think that's\nanother set of wordsI want to highlight because\nskill implies behavior.And when we were just\ntalking a second agoabout the deep, true bedrock\nsense of confidence thatcomes from looking\nsomeone in the eyeand telling somebody\nsomething that you absolutelyknow it's true\nbecause it happened,you're talking about actions.Not talking about perceptions.You're not talking about\nwhat you believe happened.You know it happened.And there's something really\nconcrete about actions.I mean, that's what's\nso interesting iswe're talking about the mind.But actions are the\nmanifestation of the mind.And the stuff that just stays\nin here, people die with that.It doesn't go anywhere.Long ago, somebody said--I forget what the context was.It was a neuroscientist.He said, most emotions,\nthey're just emotions.They're just in there.You don't have to do\nanything with them.And I think certain emotions\nyou want to do something with.But I think people forget this.They feel miserable,\nlike they'regoing to dissolve into a\npuddle of their own tears.No one ever died\nfrom an emotion.But they feel-- they overwhelm\nus as if it's a tidal wave.It's going to pull us\nunder and drown us.It's so interesting to me\nbecause I think what people--listen, you have a\ngravitational pull.People can feel the energy.I think, yes, you're\neither completely badlyor partially understood.There's only one\nguy on the planetthat truly understands you.I think there's one\nwoman, Jennifer,who probably understands you\nas much as anyone's going to.And then the rest of us\nare kind of grasping,trying to figure it out.But you're saying, go inward.So first, go inward.And then it's actions.Inward and actions.Now, the inward\npiece is somethingI'd like to just spend a little\nbit of time on because thereare a couple of characters\nfrom history, people thatwere in concentration camps.Nelson Mandela.I mean, I'm not sure he\nhad Instagram in there.I'm pretty sure he didn't.And I don't think there\nwas anyone coaching him on,hey, you're going\nto get out someday.And actually, you're going\nto lead an entire country.I'm pretty sure that's\nnot how it worked.He had to find it here.He had to find it\nbetween his ears.And there are other examples.But that's an important one.So the process of going\ninward, does it, for you--and here, I will\nask for suggestionsbecause I think people want--there are those of us who\nwant to build this skill.Wall yourself off.Phone off for big portions\nof the day, perhaps.Texting off.The requests, the\nthis, the that.Anyone that knows you\nknows that-- we'vecommunicated a few\ntexts, but most of itcomes through a filter.She's great.She knows you.And she knows how to\nprotect your time.DAVID GOGGINS: And that\nhurts people's feelings.People get mad about that.ANDREW HUBERMAN:\nHey, God bless--God bless you, Jennifer.Cutting oneself off,\nwhen you're in there,you say it's just you.And the voices that come\nup are not pleasant.And then at some point,\nit converts to action.OK.What is the process\nof picking the action?That's the piece that\nI feel like there's,like, a bridge to build here,\nif you can, if you would.DAVID GOGGINS: So the action\nbeing, like, what's next?ANDREW HUBERMAN:\nYeah, so when yougo to sleep at night,\nwhen that happens,you know what you're\ngoing to do the next day?It's pre-planned?DAVID GOGGINS: Yes.ANDREW HUBERMAN: OK.DAVID GOGGINS: Yes.It's always the same thing.ANDREW HUBERMAN: You're\nnot building it on the fly.DAVID GOGGINS: No.Nothing's on the fly.So how it works\ninternally for me is I'llput it exactly how it is.I'm an artist.And every day, I'm\npainting Mona Lisa.Every day.And but it's a different one.It's not the same painting.So every day I wake up, even\nthough I'll do the same thing,it takes a different\nway to get there.So every day, in my mind,\nI'm going through my mind.I'm just like-- and a good\npainter will not just paint.He needs to create.And you can't create with\nphones and everythinggoing around you.So you got to\nblock yourself off.You only do two\npodcasts in a year.You block yourself off.And you're painting\nthis thing inside.And you're going through\nall these different colorsof paint and everything else.And you can only figure\nout the right paintingif you spend the correct\namount of time in your brain.So every single\nday, I'm literallygoing through my mind,\nand I'm painting.I'm creating this masterpiece.And the masterpiece\nis always myself.And but to do that, you\ncannot have any distractionsbecause if you're talking to an\nartist and he's trying to thinkabout the next\npainting, he can't.It's impossible to\nlisten to you and listento what your mind and body\nare telling you we must do.Because people\ndon't do enough of.They don't do any of it.They don't have passion.They lack passion,\ndrive, determinationbecause you haven't\nspent time with yourself.Your mind will tell\nyou what is next.But you haven't\nspent the time to go,all right, let me\njust figure this out.You're looking for let me Google\nthis, and let me Google that,and let me-- you're not\ngoing to find it therebecause there's billions\nof people in this world.And they're all supposed\nto be individuals.But we have a pack mentality.That's why you're\nso fucking lost.Why am I so unique?I'm being exactly what the\nfuck I was supposed to be.I ain't follow shit.And when I did follow shit,\nI was like everybody else.The second I said, OK, man, hang\non, dude, you don't like this,you don't like this, you\ndon't like this, who are you,David Goggins?Who are you supposed to be?Miraculously, all\nthese things just--I couldn't even-- the list of\nshit I had to do, just, wham.It's like, fuck.OK.Wow.Once you sit down with\nyourself and say, OK, Idon't want to be like\nMichael Jordan or Jim Brown--they're both born\non my birthday.So I looked at their birthday.I said, oh, maybe I\ncan be one of the--I can't.I'm going to be David\nfucking Goggins.And that looks like this.It just came.Everything flooded.So every single day\nof my life, there'sa different thing that\ncomes up that I have to do.But no one knows what to do\nbecause everybody else isfollowing steps.Like the Republican\nand Democratic parties.I'm not political--ANDREW HUBERMAN: Neither am I.DAVID GOGGINS: --at\nall for this reason.Republicans are going\nto vote Republican.Democrats are going\nto vote Democrat.You're not even a human\nfucking being, bro.No way all you fuckers agree\nwith all the same fucking shit.And I know I don't.So once you figure out\nyourself and who you are,all the answers come.So every night, a different\npainting is being painted.And it's a beautiful\npainting for myself.I'm like, OK.That's it.It may look the same\nto most motherfuckers.But the end result is\nvery fucking different.That's why my-- if you look\nat what I've done in 49 years,it's more than most people\nwill ever do in their lifebecause they were\na race car driver.And that's what they did.They drove a fucking car.It's great.I was all kind of shit\nbecause that's exactly whatthe painting was saying to do.It's what the mind\nwas saying to do.Wasn't saying just drive a car,\nso then that race car driverdidn't know what the fuck to do.He retires from being a race\ncar driver, and they're lost.People go, how are you still--I don't get it.Dude, you're never\ngoing to fill your list.But you never found your\nlist because it neverwas presented in front of\nyou because your head wascluttered with shit because\nyou never just stoppedfor lots of minutes, lots\nof years, and just said,all right, it's me and you.Let it go.And it just-- bam.It's right there.It's right there.ANDREW HUBERMAN: I'm\nnot a psychologist,"

            "text": "as I mentioned before.But I'm going to venture\na hypothesis here.I think that you've mastered the\nprocess of internal dialogue.But when I say dialogue, I\nthink most people think, oh,the inner voice, the chatter.But that's just one\nhalf of a dialogue.A dialogue is a two-way street.So I completely agree because\nI know from experiencethat when we go inward,\noftentimes, we hear things,if we're really honest with\nourselves, it's like, oh no,I don't want to\nthink about that.No.And then we start\nlooking outward.Or we start trying to shift\nour attention or distract.And there are a\nmillion reasons thatare handed to us, excuses, and\nseemingly good justificationsto be able to do that.But dialogue is\na two-way street.And it hit me\nwhile you were justsaying what you\nwere saying, I waspaying very close attention.And I realized David Goggins\nis talking about the voice thatcomes up, including the\nterrible stuff that no one wantsto hear about themselves\nfrom themselves.But then he's also got\nthe dialogue down wherehe knows the counter voice.He goes, yeah, you're right.And so I'm going to do this.Or maybe no, remember this.You're in a dialogue, a\ntwo-way dialogue in there, nota one-way chatter dialogue.There are books written\nby famous psychologistsabout chatter, trying to\nshift your internal narrative.You're like, bring\nthe internal--the internal narrative, that's\nwhat going inward is about.But it's not one voice.Again, there's a hypothesis.And I'm not claiming\nto be all-knowing.Lord knows I'm not all-knowing.But you've mastered\nthe dialogue.And if there are three voices,\nstrong, medium, and weak,in there, you're like,\nlet's all come to the table.So you've got a symphony\nof voices in therethat are all you, that\nyou know to be you.And you know how to have\nthose convers-- you're notafraid to be in\nthose conversations.And then you know what the\noutcome of that committeedecision is, and you put\nit into real-world action.And the world only\nsees the action.DAVID GOGGINS: That's it.ANDREW HUBERMAN:\nAnd only you canknow your internal dialogue.And only I can know\nmy internal dialogue.And the only way to,\nquote unquote, \"know it\"is to spend a hell\na lot of time there.DAVID GOGGINS: That's right.ANDREW HUBERMAN: OK.DAVID GOGGINS: A lifetime.ANDREW HUBERMAN: Got it.DAVID GOGGINS: A lifetime.Like, think about it.For me to be sitting\nhere in front of you,you're not going to\ncall 300-pound Ecolabguy to come sit here.You might.I don't know.Maybe.ANDREW HUBERMAN: Probably not.DAVID GOGGINS: Probably not.Think about this.What we teach people is\nkind, kindness to yourself.Do you think if I\ntaught myself kindness--and I agree with it.God, so many people-- so many\npeople take me out of context,it's ridiculous.Take it however the fuck\nyou want to take it.When I was 300\npounds, where do youthink that conversation\nwould that got meif I spoke kindness to myself?I'll tell you where it gets me.Right back to 7-Eleven with\nanother box of mini chocolatedonuts and a\nchocolate milkshake.That's the one voice.That's the one voice\nthat most of us havethat you're talking about.If you don't have a conversation\nin there, the other voicethat you create that says,\nOK, how does this look?Looks very ugly.That kind conversation for\nme went away a long time ago,which is why the dialogue\nis now what you see.A lot of action.Because most people have\ninaction because there'sone person talking.And that one person\nis always leading youdown the same\npath, the path thatmakes you feel very comfortable\nand happy with yourself.The second you create the\nother voice, there's conflict.Just battles.Just wars.Just defeat.One thing I learned, and\nI taught myself this,and people go, I don't\nunderstand what you're saying,I'm going to try to\nbreak it down real quick.I didn't teach\nmyself victory first.I taught myself failure.I taught myself how to fail.And people like,\nthat's so depressing.Is it?When you're 300 pounds and\nyou can't read and writeand you're fucked up,\nyou know how many timesyou're going to fucking\nfail on that process?So if you don't know how to\nfail, there is no victory.I never talked about\nwinning because Iknew the path to\nwinning was goingto be years of failing first.So I taught myself\nhow to fail properly.No one teaches you\nhow to fucking fail.But if you're going out\nfor insurmountable fuckingodds that make absolutely\nno fucking sense,a Black kid that can't\nswim, 300 pounds--going to be a Navy SEAL.OK.You better teach yourself\nhow to fail firstbecause if you sit in\nfailure for too long,you will never come out of it.So the first part\nof my success waslearning how to fail properly.And then eventually, I started\ngetting a few victories.But that's what\npeople don't get.When you have buried yourself\nin such a deep fucking hole,you better first talk\nabout the failuresyou're going to have first.And that's when that\nother voice comes up.It tells you, we've\ngot to do something.But it also tells\nyou, boy, I'm notgoing to lie to you, Goggins.You're in for a\nfucking climb, bro.You're going to get\nyour ass handed to you,made fun of, the outside\nnoise, the inside noise.Both voices are going\nto be fucking tellingyou to go fuck yourself.You are in for hell, bro.I am.So I better learn to fail.ANDREW HUBERMAN:\nSo this is what youmean when you say that\nwhatever anyone says,it's insignificant?DAVID GOGGINS:\nInsignificant as fuck.ANDREW HUBERMAN:\nIt's the cap gun firebecause it's just like\nit-- because the voicein your own head is far worse.And I should say, sorry, one\nof the voices in your head.I'm being very detailed,\nalmost surgicalabout that because I think\nthis thing about inner dialoguewe think is one voice.But you're making it\nclear it's many voices.DAVID GOGGINS: It is.And the thing about it is,\nyou have to be really--and sometimes all the\nvoices are telling youthe wrong shit, man.But through years, years, not a\npodcast or listening to a bookor reading a book,\nyears of sacrifice,of suffering, of diligent\npinpoint fucking workon what you want\nto do for yourself,not like, oh, let me\njust do a bunch of shit.Let me-- I want to be\nin every task possible.No.Pinpoint what I want\nto do with my life.What happens is you have\nall these voices thatare telling you\nyou're fucked up,and this is going to be hard.But for some reason, you put\nso much practice into youthat you can ignore\nevery one of them thatare telling you you're not\ngoing to fucking make it.And still be able\nto fucking make itbecause you have put\nthe practice in that youknow this is the process.It's such a daunting task that\nall the voices are saying no.But you still have\nthe convictionthat I know I can do this.And that's what it took\nfor me to get here.20, 30 years ago, I had this--35 or whatever it was,\n25 years ago, pipe dream.And ever since then, every voice\nwas like, you're a fucking nut.But when you put that practice\nin every day, you lace them up.And I mean, run.It's just a metaphor for life.When you lace them\nmotherfuckers up every day,pretty soon, you win.Pretty soon, you'll fucking win.If you have the courage and\nthe heart and the dedicationand the mindset of everybody\ncan go fuck themselves,I know what I know.I've listened to\nmyself enough to know.I know what I know.None of you can hear\nwhat I'm hearing.And that's what people\ndon't do enough of.They don't listen\nto their journey.They listen to\neverybody else's shit.Before you know it, I'm crazy.But if I'm so fucking crazy,\nwhy am I so successful?How that happen?But I'm so misguided\nand fucked up.And don't listen to him.Why am I the only one to\ndo a whole bunch of shit?Why am I a trailblazer?Why?How is that possible?How can you be fucked up and\nalso self-made at the samefucking--no.No.Obviously, you're not looking\nat the truth in front of you.The truth in front\nof you is it sucks.It's painful.It's fucking mind-numbing.And that is the truth.And that's why a\nlot of people don'tlike listening to me because\nthis is what it takes,creating another voice and\nsometimes going at it alone.All the time going at it\nalone because no one'sgoing to believe in you.And that's that.ANDREW HUBERMAN: What I'm\nabout to say is not conjecture."

            "text": "And I can say that\nwith confidencebecause I did a\nfour-episode guestseries with a brilliant\npsychiatrist, a guy namedPaul Conti.He's from Trenton.He's a Stanford,\nHarvard-trained guy.He's also got a lot\nof street in him.He's had his own\nhardship, real hardship.He's brilliant.And he said something\nthat I'll never forget,which is, we think that\nthe forebrain, the partof our brain that creates\nstrategy, et cetera,is the supercomputer.He said, no, no, no,\nno, no, no, no, no, no.No, no, no.He's like, the\nsupercomputer of the brainis the unconscious mind.It's the part of our mind that's\ncontrolling most everything.And most people,\nunfortunately, don'tdo the work to understand\nhow their unconscious iscontrolling them.And that's a scary\nthing, this idea,like your mind is\ncontrolling you.And I'm not going to get\ninto the free will debate.I believe in at least some will.I believe what you're describing\nand this internal dialogue,I think you have access\nto your unconscious mindby listening to the\ndialogue, going inward.We know this is true in sleep,\nin dreams, in meditation,and just by shutting out\neverything else, shutting outall the external\nnoise, which is filledwith things that pull us to it.Noise makes it sound bad, but\nit's the gravitational pullof all the things that allow\nus to distract ourselveswithout knowing.The ice cream.The have a cookie.The Merry Christmas.The unconscious\nmind, this huge pieceof the iceberg underneath that\nPaul calls the supercomputer,he's saying that with\nknowledge as a neurobiologist,psychiatrist, psychologist,\nso he really knows,that's the piece that if\none does real introspection,he calls it the cupboards.You got to look\nin the cupboards.And it's often really scary\nwhat you find in there.And most people are\njust like, I don't evenwant to know the\ncupboards are there.But you're pulling all\nthe cupboard doors open.And then you're-- and you're\nextremely deliberate with whatgets put into action.You're not just going,\noh, like, I'm pissed,so I'm going to act pissed.Or I'm tired, so I'm\ngoing to act tired.It's you're picking very\ncarefully what to do.And that's a process that\nI'm guessing came to you.Does it come to you\nas a, OK, it makessense why running makes sense.It makes sense why\nsmokejumping makes sense.So it seems like a huge\nportion of your timeis spent understanding yourself\nand making sense to you.And so when people\ndon't understand you,it's got to be extra frustrating\nbecause most people don'tunderstand themselves.So then we're all running\naround going, you're this,and you're that because\nmost people are justunwilling to look inward.And I'm including\nmyself, by the way.I mean, I've done a fair\namount of introspection.But I'm inspired today, that\nword, inspired, but it's true,motivated to start going inward\nfurther because it is scary.It's like, we don't know\nwhat's in those cupboards,and it's terrifying, especially\nbecause we don't know.DAVID GOGGINS: And those are\nthe first ones to open up.And like you talked\nabout, you gotto go through those cupboards.I do spring cleaning\nevery fuckingday in those dark cupboards.Those dark cabinets are the\nones I start with first.That's the real me, man.That's the real me.That's why I'm not ashamed.I don't hide.I used to hide.I don't hide anymore.He's exactly right.I don't know all the\nfucking science behind shit.I know what I know.That's why I don't listen\nto anybody anymore.I don't listen to shit.I think most people are\nfull of shit because I know.I know the deep, dark secrets\nof those fucking cupboards.It's ugly, man.And every day, I'm\ntalking to them.Every day, I'm cleaning them.I'm cleaning them,\nand I'm talkingto the same demons that came\nout of those fucking cupboardsas I'm cleaning them.Sometimes they go right\nback in them again.It's not easy.And this is why\nmost of us just--why I am misunderstood\nbecause what comes outof those cabinets\nthat I'm cleaning,sometimes they see on Instagram.Sometimes they'll\nsee it in a podcast.Sometimes they see\nit in this one.I turn people off.Open up your own cabinets.And then go talk about it.Let me see how pretty it looks.Let me see how pretty you sound.Let me see how put\ntogether your words are.I bet you a fuck or a\nmotherfucker comes outbecause for you to go\nback in there againto clean the same fucking\ncabinet that the demon came outof takes some big balls, bro.To do it every day of your life.To go back in there and spring\nclean every day, not oncea fucking year,\nonce every decade.Every day you know\nit gets dusty.And every day, you don't\nstart with the victories.You don't go, oh, this is nice.Look at my-- look at\nmy I love me wall.Let me clean up.This is a little dusty.No.I go right for the things that\nare going to keep me buried.And I go right there first\nbecause if I don't clean thoseout first, the\nday doesn't start.So what are you\nsaying to me is truth.And like I told you\nmany times today, Ican never figure out how to\nexplain this shit to peoplebecause I'm not neuro nothing.I'm just a guy that said, OK,\nwe got to start in the dungeon.And we got to stay here\nfor the rest of our lives.For you to become\nsuccessful, the dungeonis a place that has to be clean.And it's the\nscariest place to be.That's why I'm\nmisunderstood because I'mspeaking from the dungeon.That's why I am\nsuccessful because Igo there every damn day.And that is the\ntruth, what he says.It's the exact truth.Those cabinets are\nfucking dusty, dirty,and scary as shit.Broken glass, fucking\ndark, spiders, cobwebs.But most of all,\nyour biggest fears,the biggest things that put\nyou in a fucked up place youare today are in there.That's why we all like\nto keep them shut.You like to lock them up.Act like they never happened.That's why you never grow.You never improve.You never have\nreal conversationslike we're having right now.Never.Never.Oh no.No, no, no, no, no.Let's not-- no, no, no.Let's not go there.I talked to so many\npeople who tell me that.Let's talk about this.Because they'll tell me, but\nthey can only say it once.And they'll say it in passing.They won't get deep\nin the weeds with it.Like, you can't just clean it.Motherfucker, you got to\nspit shine that motherfucker.You got to relive it,\nevery fucking detail of it.You can't just be like, oh\nyeah, yeah, my dad beat me.And it is what it is.It ain't is what it\nis, motherfucker.It's killing you.It's taken over your\nwhole fucking life.But that's the conversation.Yeah, my dad beat-- but\nI'm fine now, though.I'm good.OK.All right.No, you ain't.You ain't fine.You ain't fine.This is real talk.People don't have that.So your boy's right.100% right.Scary as shit.It's scary as shit.But it makes you who\nyou're supposed to be.And that's the test.We forget.We think we're supposed to\nbreathe air and have kidsand pay the bills and shit.But what's this life about?That makes no sense.We're being tested, my friend.Tests come when you\nhave not studied.Tests come when you think\nthat you're in a great place.That's the test.The test is every\nday of your life.And most of us fail\nbecause we don'tknow why we're here because\nwe don't go inward to say, oh.You gave me a lot\nof shit to fix, man.And this test sucks.But then you start.ANDREW HUBERMAN: David Goggins.I don't think I\ncould add to that.I know I can't.Thank you for sharing\nwhat you shared today.I mean, as much as your\nprocess or anyone's processcan't be completely\nunderstood from the outside,you gave us a real\nwindow into this thing,this process that you--as you said, God put it on you.I believe in God too.People can believe\nwhat they want.But somehow, your life, God gave\nyou these challenges early on.And then there was a point\nwhere you went internal.And like you said,\nyou developed a skill.But it's a perishable skill.And you clearly\nlive in the processof opening those cupboards,\nreopening those cupboards,trying to spit shine\nthose cupboards,understanding that they're\nnever, ever really done,but that you can gain ground\non them, that you can win dayafter day after day.And you really shared a\nlot of concrete thingsthat I know people\nare going to beable to apply if they choose.And I agree with you.I think most people\nwill be like, whoa.That was a lot.It's heavy.I think I want to just kind of\nbake myself in Netflix and ChexMix instead.But there's also the\nreality that thereare men and women, boys and\ngirls who hear that and go, OK,and start cracking\nthe cupboards open.And I just know\nthat for myself, I'mextremely grateful that\nyou're willing to put itall out there.You're so brutally honest,\nso brutally authentic.That word authenticity\ngets thrown around so much.And I can tell you that for me\nand for everybody else, that'sreally what resonates.So whether or not you want\nto, whether or not it'sthe purpose behind it or not,\nyou're lighting the path.So thank you.DAVID GOGGINS:\nRespect Thank you.Thanks for having me.ANDREW HUBERMAN: Thank\nyou for joining me"
