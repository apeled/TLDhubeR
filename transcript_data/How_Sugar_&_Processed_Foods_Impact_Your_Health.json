            "text": "protein let's say you eat too muchprotein you yeah you know the PorterHouse steak all right now if you're abodybuilderthose amino acids might go to muscle andyou might increase your muscle massbecause you're a bodybuilder becauseyou're putting uh excess uh force onthose muscles and you're growing thosemuscles okay but let's say you're not abodybuilder let's say you're a meremoral like me or let's say you're a kidgoing through puberty who's synthesizinga lot of muscle not because they'relifting weights because they're becausetestosterone's making it happen yeahabsolutely but let's say you're notlet's say you know you're just you knowjust slump off the the street like uhyou know joeo okay and you eat thatPorterHouse you've taken on all these aminoacids there's no place to store it otherthan muscle so your liver takes theexcess and deamidates that amino acidtakes the amino group off to turn itfrom a amino acid into an organic acidand then that organic acid can thenenter the kreb cycle the tricarboxylicacid cycle what goes on in themitochondria in order to generate ATPthe chemical energy that your body needsin order to power itself okay now that'sa good thing it takes double the amountof energy to prepare that amino acid forburning as it does to uh prepare acarbohydrate for burning or fat forbecause when I asked about when youasked about almonds why the the 160versus 130 I thought it was theprocessing it turned out it was fiberyou're saying for protein let let's makeit realistic for a a really nice bigporterhouse steak which I love by theway let's say let's say 800 caloriesyeah well it turns out how much of thatis is uh so that's what goes in yourmouth right my mouth right how much ofit is actually um eaten in uh to staywith the your calorie eaten is not acalorie eaten in the processing of thatwhat percentages actually goes into yourtotal caloric intake right so about 10%of everything you eat goes to justmaintaining body temperature it's calledthe thermic effect of food but whenyou're eating protein you actuallygenerate more Heat and the reason isbecause it takes to ATP to phosphoratethat organic acid as opposed to one ATPto uh phosphorate that carbohydrate foruh consumption so you actually have anet loss of energy because it was a anamino acid versus a monosaccharide asugar now you you brought up fat fatdoesn't need to be phosphorated so itactually doesn't have any um thermiceffective food at that point so dependson what it is as to whether or not youhave loss okay so but in this um let'smake it actually realistic a 1600calorie uh Porter House with a nice slabof of uh of fed butter on there I dothis every once in a while not not oftenwith some cream spinach and maybe somemushrooms along the side honestly I whenI'm eating a porter house I don't wantto adulterate The Taste okay withanything else except maybe some somebutter maybe a salad okay afterwards butbut let's say 1 1600 calories of of it'sgot some fat in there for sure uh let'ssay um uh a thousand of those caloriesis protein mhm the other 600 arefat something like that like thatdepending on how marbled it is okay sobased on what you just said about thethermic effect of food and protein inparticular yeah of that thousandcalories how much actually is can wecount I'm not a calorie counter but doesone include as calories truly ingestedwell if you ingested 1600 well that'swhat went in the mouth but but but whatis is going to go against your your uhburn deficit right so I would have toactually do the math to figure that outbut as a guess yeah back of the envelopeback of the envelope calculation you'regoing to lose about 25% of that wow sowe're talking 750 calories yeah you knowso and to translate this a bit so whatwe're saying here is if you're somebodywho is trying to lose weight or maintainweight or perhaps even gain weight youeat a 1600 calorie Porter House with aslab of butter on it 600 of thosecalories we're saying in this instanceis fat with the remaining thousandcalories that's that all went in yourmouth so you count it at your mouthright but 700 but then when you compareit against your energy burn for that dayto maintain temperature brain activityphysical activity really it's only 750calories that's right that's a hugedifference exactly and another reasonwhy a calorie is not a calorie now let'stake the third let's take fats so overhere we have omega-3s heart healthyanti-inflammatory anti-alzheimer's saveyour life and over here we have transfats the devil incarnate consumablepoison because you can't break the transdouble bond you don't have thedesaturates to break that trans doublebond so it basically accumulates linesyour arteries lines your liver causeschronic metabolic disease causes insulinresistanceOmega-3s don't even get broken down forenergy because they're so important theystay intact because your brain needsthem your heart needsthem whereas trans fats can't be brokendown because of that trans double bondone save your life other one kill youthey're both nine calories per gram ifyou explode them in a bomb calorimeterbecause a calorie burned is a calorieburned but a calorie eaten is not acalorie eaten because one will save yourlife one will killyou and finally the Big Kahuna the onethat blows everything else out of the"

            "text": "water from ose and glucose all right nowglucose is the energy of life so herewe're talking carbohydrates I think mostof our audience will be familiar withthe so-call macronutrients so we talkedabout fat in this case almonds there'ssome Fiber in there probably a littlebit of carbohydrate a little bit littlebit talked about the Porter House withbutter right making me hungry alreadythat's protein and fat M very little ofany carbohydrate it should be zeroessentially maybe one zero zero yum and then now we're talking aboutcarbohydrates and we're going tosubdivide that into glucose and fructoseright galactose basically becomesglucose in the liver so we we candispense with that unless you have adisease called galactosemia which isabout one in 20,000 um and causesneonatal menitis and you know it's adisease as a pediatric endocrinologist Iwould take care of but we can dispensewith that for the moment all right soglucose fructose glucose is the energyof life every cell on the planet Burnsglucose for energy glucose is so damnimportant that if you don't consume ityour body makes it so it will take anamino acid and turn it into glucosethat's gluconeogenesis glucogenesisthat's right it will take a fatty acidand turn it into glucose andspecifically the glycerol portion of thetriglyceride will turn intoglucoseso theInuit they didn't have any place to growcarbohydrate they had ice they had whaleblubber they still have serum glucoselevel and the reason is because you hadto you have to have a serum glucoselevel in order to power your brain inorder to power your heart yes you youcan use ketones of course you can butyou know only if you're in a ketogenicstate will you use exclusively ketonesand you also need glucose for structuralchanges in specific proteins andparticularly hormones so glucosemolecules will stud TSH LH FSH differentpituitary hormones in order to increasetheir potency it's one of the reasonswhy aging leads to defectivehormonogenesis for instance hypogonadismhypothyroidism is the loss ofglycosilation on individual um uh uhpeptide hormones because of uh theinability to add glucose because ofinsulin just it's an aging phenomenonokay we'll come back to this cuz I thinkthat's really important yeah the ideathat ingestion ofcarbohydrates and the as you called itthe studing of carbohydrate molecules onhormones can augment the function ofthose hormones and with aging that's aless efficient process it's a lessefficient process but it's not becauseof consumption it's right people arestill I I see the the uh plenty of folkswho are uh 65 and older eating plenty ofcarbohydrates you're saying a lot ofthem have deficient thyroid testosteroneestrogen right um prolactin Etc becauseof the Wes those carbohydrates are notstuding the uh the hormones exactly sothey're all of those are glycoproteinhormones let's tea that up for laterbecause I think that's an interestingAvenue to go down okay and there's a andthere's a disease in children in inbabies called congenital disorders ofglycosilation where you can't put uh uhglucose Mo uh molecules on specificproteins and it causes severe mentalretardation all sorts of metabolic havocand a lot of those babies die for thatmatter so that's an important thing allright but that's how important glucoseis fructose on the other hand this sweetmolecule the molecule we seek the reasonwhy the food industry studs every foodin the grocery store you know 73% of allitems in the American Grocery Store haveadded sugar on purpose for the foodindustry's purpose is not for yoursbecause fructose is addictive activatesthe nucleus accumbens the reward centerof the brain in the same way thatcocaine heroin nicotine alcohol do anddrives dopamine receptors down just likenicotine you know alcohol you knowcocaine heroindo that moleculefructose is number one uh completelyvestigial to all vertebrate life thereis no biochemical reaction in anyvertebrate that requires dietaryfructose that's number one number twookay sorry I'm going to juster so you'resaying that even though we can processfructose we have a limited capacity toprocess it in the same way we have alimited capacity to metabolizealcohol now if you have one drink a dayyou you're okay if you have two drinks aday depends on how big you are you knowyou and I can probably I would argue twodrinks a week is the maximum but butlet's not go there the um but but interms of you're saying when yousay fructose processing a fructose isvestigal what you're saying is that wedon't need to do it it's like theappendix it's an organ for which it hasno function exactly and fructose has nofunction in the human body period youdon't need it you don't need it don'tneed it but our diet is replete with itin fact our fructose consumption hasgone up 25 fold since the beginning ofthe last century I have to ask this nowI love fruit I eat berries Galoreespecially since the price of berriesseems to have come down it used to bethat you only get them certain times ofyear I'm what you call a drive byblueberry eater so I'll just walk pastand just take a fist full you can't putthem in front of me without me eatingthem this is even difficult for me whenother people I don't know are eatingthem so um I lots of blueberriesstrawberries blackberries if they're inseason I love them no problem loadedwith fructose no plenty of fiber lowfructose low fructose and berriesberries are the lowest fructose of allthe so worried about asking you thistoday okay um and fruit is okay becauseof the fiber so the molecule thefructose molecule is the same whetherit's in a berry or in a banana or forthat matter in in a Coca-Cola thefructose molecule is the same moleculethe difference is that in the berry itcomes with a whole lot of fiber and thebanana comes with a whole lot less fiberand in the Coca-Cola it doesn't comewith any fiber and the fiber is whatmitigates theabsorption so when you consume thefructose with fiber so your blueberriesyou're feeding yourmicrobiome that fructose wasn't for yougot it such a relief and umI I must say recently I had a whole bodyMRI as a preemptive thing uh someonethat it was it was great I got to watcha Netflix in there and um I never had awhole body MRI I learned a few thingsthat were useful to me I've got a cleanbill of health so that's great one ofthe pie of feedback I got is um that mygut was filled with this very highcontrast um stuff right and they askedyou know do you consume a lot ofblueberries and I said indeed I do whyand they said um because that highcontrast offf it shows up white on thescan is um high concentrations ofmagnesium MH um that we see in peoplethat ingest large amounts of blueberrieswhich is pretty rare and yours arecomparable to a bear in blueberry seasonwow um and basically my entire gut wasfilled with with blueberries I suppose Ineed to cut back a little bit but now Iknow that fruit is okay especially ifthe fruit has a lot of fiber yeah butfructose itself especially if it's notpartnered with fiber yeah is first ofall not required for survival at all butyou're telling me is uh problematic yeahand let me tell you why it's problematicwe haven't gotten to that yet we're justtalking about whether it's vestigalversus needed now let's talk about whatfructose"

in Ron cons lab sothis is a tissue specific insulinreceptor knockout Mouse Okay IR KOinsulin LAX insulin receptor in specificthe kidney in the kidney intercoglomular poicy insulin receptor knockoutwe haven't talked too much abouttransgenic models and knockins andKnockouts so uh just in 10 seconds or Lebasically these are mice that aregenetically engineered to lack thereceptor for insulin specifically in theglul poite the kidney in the in thekidney and everywhere else in this mouseinsulin does its thing normally exactlygreat so these animals are ug glycemicnormal blood glucose levels theseanimals are normally glucose tolerantthey you know go up they go down justlike every otherMouse these mice are not fat these miceare not thin these mice aremice except they have the worst diabeticnephropathy on the planet so their neroh their kidney is degenerative theirkidneys is degenerate to nothing yikesnow they have normal blood glucoselevels they have normal glucosetolerance they have normal insulintolerance whole body but they're kidneysaredying how come can't be theglucose it's theinsulin because insulin is the bad guyinsulin's actually making the kidneydisease and so these animals that areinsulin resistant they have diabeticnephropathy withoutdiabetes so the insulin is having anegative clearly negative effect on thekidneys without binding to the receptorexactly so circulating insulin can dostuff without binding to its receptorwell it's no it binds to its receptor indifferent parts of the body other partsof the body party it can't because it'sa knockout because it's knockout rightthe point is insulin does stuff byitself and it turns out insulin drivesgrowth now every cell in yourbody wants to burn at one time in itslife and wants to grow at another timein life every cell has those twoPathways burning growth burning growthwhat determines whether acell should be burning or whether a cellshould be growing I don't know whatmakes it um burning but presumably it'sin the has something to do withmitochondria it has everything to dowith mitochondria right so every cellneeds to burn and needs to grow at adifferent time in its life here's a wayto think about it we all start out as azygote a singlecell we end up anadult now that single cell had to becometwocells those two cells had to become fourcells those four cells had to becomeeight cells and on and on and on and onso every cycle there's adoubling how many doublings to get froma zygote to an adult what's anexponential growth so yeah I don't Idon't know it off the top of my head41 41 41 two to the 41 doublings giv youan organism 10 trillion cells we're 10trillion cells we're 10 trillion cellsdid we know that yeah okay two to the 41okay okay now of those 41 doublings someof them had to occur inutero some of them had to occurpostnatally so I need two numbers thatadd up to 41 how many in utero how manypostnatally well waymore you start off with a lot more thanyou end up with but then you have cellsthat turn over throughout the lifespanso this is a tough one okay because skincells turnover I I with neurons it'sit's pretty straightforward becauseyou're going to somewhere between threeand 10 right well you're and you're bornwith somewhere between 3 and 10x of whatyou end up with depending on the brainstructure so but for whole body I don'tknow how you'd come up with that number36 andfive okay 36 doublingsprenatally five doublings postnatallyand I can prove that to you too typicalbaby weighs s pounds first doubling 14pounds second doubling 208 lb nextdoubling 56 lb next doubling 112 lb nextdoubling 224 lb that's hopefully itstops OB division hopefully it stopsthere not not all people 212 lbs areobese um but some people who are ofcertain Heights or below are 212 aerobesokay point is the cell has to know whento grow and when to burn it turns outthat the signal for that isoxygen because oxygen is necessary formitochondria to be able to burn in theabsence of oxygen the cell only knowshow to grow this is actually why OTwarberg won the Nobel Prize in 19 1931for the warberg effect he asked thequestion how come cancer cells don'tneed oxygen to grow and the answer isbecause no cell needs oxygen to grow infact oxygen is the thing that preventsgrowth famous article from the NewEngland Journal of Medicine 1951 MountEverest in utero because everyfetus is oxygendeprived so normalpartial pressure of oxygen 100 millim ofmercury out here right if if I checkedyour blood it'd be about 100 right Ihope so how about a tumor cell umguessing tumor cell isprobably is it double about 44 wait youjust told me partial pressure of ofoxygen in a tumor cell it's about 44well you just told me that well tumorcells which grow like wild right theygrow like wild because they don't haveoxygenbut they but there's some of the sohere's what's peculiar about it um tumorcells are some of the most vascularizedcells or tumors are are heavilyvascularized I mean I mean one way toone way to try and kill one is to todevascularize the tumor yes and you knowAng Genesis inhibition Etc you it's abig deal you know Judah folman and allthat from Harvard you know so the excessblood to a tumor is the attempt to bringin oxygen that it's not getting that'sright as opposed to deliv in lots ofoxygen and that's why it's growingthat's right okay but a fetus what's thepartial pressure in the placenta I don'tknow 6 to31 so it's actually like a mile aboveMount Everest that's how much oxygen thefetus gets and it's that for that reasonthat you've got 36 doublings and then assoon as you're out you know you cut thecord and you start breathing and nowyour partial pressure is at 100 that'swhen growth slows downhas there been any effort to treattumors by oxygenating tumors yes andwhat does that look like it's hyperbaricoxygen therapy it's a thing oh yeah yeahyeah we we'll probably do an episode onhyperbaric chambers it's the the thereason we haven't yet is it's prettyniche in but there are people who ownthese things who sit in these things umokay so we got here by way of by way ofcar by The Bagel right um so I just wantto orient us um that you just that 250calories of the The Bagel we talkedabout glucose excursions but it's thatinsulin rise that's driving the atoposit's also driving thegrowth okay in the absence of oxygenbecause if you have oxygen then youdon't need that muchinsulin okayso because you're going to burn instead"

is is used how much is usedyeah let's assume that I'm I'm at mydesk working or I'm walking around alittle bit I'm not I'm not exercisinghard in the in the subsequent hour soused for what is the question I'mgetting back to the calorie is is acalorie a calorie clearly the answer isno based on the processing of differenttypes of calories we established it forfat the almonds we establish it forproteinthe Porter House with butter and nowwe're we're trying to establish that forthe 250 calories of of bagel which isglucose right so the glucose has to bephosphorated so you're going to lose uhan ATP in the process so you're going togo ATP goes to ADP and then that ADPwill go to am a denzine monophosphatewhich will then go to im an ocolmonophosphate which will then go to uricacid okay and that uric acid will bethen released from the cell circulate inthe bloodstream and hopefully go out inthe kidney in the process that uric acidcan inhibit mitochondrial function andit can also inhibit endothelial nitricoxide synthese which is the enzyme inyour vasculature that is your endogenousblood pressure lowerer right byexpanding blood vessels and capillariesexactly right this is the mechanistic uhfoundation of the drugs that wereoriginally used for uh improvingprostate function but are used to treaterectile dysfunction which are the thePD Inhibitors which allow nitric oxideto be uh around longer and more of itright people use it for other purposestoo um now no one will forget if I queueit up with that that example well we weuh you know in the neonatal IntensiveCare Unit it closes patent ductusarteriosis which is a big deal in uh inthe neonatal uh uh World okay I I wantto ask you about that but but um so Iheard two things one is that um gluc oseand the insulin that goes with itincreases uric acid MH uric acid whileit has certain important functions inhealth too much of it you said Caninhibit nitric oxide yeah can inhibitnitric oxide so that means that theblood vessels and capillaries are goingto stay more constricted so bloodpressure is going to be higher than itwould be normally that's right and thenuric acid is also inhibitingmitochondrial function that's right okayum but eating half a bagel isn'tnecessarily a terrible thing if it'swithin your caloric require requirementsit and it it all depends on how much uhyou clear and how high your insulin goesnow let's compare that 250 calories ofglucose to 250 calories of fructoseright uh let's let's come up with a foodexample 250 calories of fructose wouldbe trivial to uh consume in the form ofhigh fructose corn syrup right well soremember that high fructose corn syrupis half glucose half fructose 125 125 solet's not use that well so let's assumeum so we can talk about a soda for uh toget that that uh 250 calories easily umespecially if it's not a can or aEuropean siiz bottle or can 8 o 8 oz canof soda okay so 8 oce can of soda um andmaybe let's include a food item let'stalk like a store-bought packaged cookiecouple Oreos two Oreos okay probably getyou to that 250 or maybe four Oreosmaybe three Oreos yeah okay um Oreolovers everywhere celebratethree 250 calories offructose what's the effect on uric acidwhat's the effect on caloric burn what'sthe effect on anything for that matterthat uh we should be aware of all rightso first of all the Oreo has plenty offructose in it so keep that in mind okaythe um if let's say you consumed uh 250calories in a bagel because that'spretty much polymerized glucose versussay the soda so the bagel versus thesoda that's what you're equalentcalories equalent calories or the TheBagel versus let's say two Oreos and alittle bit of um and yeah two Oreos okayso number one there's only half theglucose in the soda because the otherhalf is the fructose it's 125125 so yourglucose rise won't be as high yourglucose Excursion will be lower this isactually one of the reasons why there'sthis thing called glycemic indexglycemic index is a Canard it's garbageit is complete and utter BS the glycemicindex absolute BS nothing nothing ismore um uh egregious in terms of uhargument than then than the glycemicindex and this is one of the things thatdietitians promote and espouse and oneof the things that's got to go okay thisis an idea that must die okay we'll getback to why the glycemic index has gotto die uh but so so the 250 calories andactually can we can we make these equaljust for sake of of Simplicity can wesay 250 calories of glucose from TheBagel versus 250 calories of fructosehow do we get 250 calories of purefructose we don't you can't okay you gotto bring the glucose with lab Labfructose you'd have to make it with theOreos which is half glucose halffructose right I mean there is nofructose alone in nature even crackerssome of the ones that are salty are alsosweet they have fructose in themAbus yeah that's why it's impossible toeat just one indeed um so what'shappening biochemically as a consequenceof the fructose component specificallyso the fructose will first of all gointo the intestine the intestine willmetabolize some of that fructose throughwhat is known as intestinal denovalipogenesis about 10% of that fructosewill be turned into fat right in theintestine and that's cuz fructose itjust wants to be fat yeah fructose wantsto be fat fructose is the lipogenicsubstrate here we're not talking aboutbody fat we're talking about fatmolecules that can potentially be usedas energy that's right triglyceridemolecules okay so that so 10% of thatfructose will be turned intotriglyceride right in the intestine andbe released into the bloodstream and itis the reason for a post prandialtriglyceride response postprandial is uhand I'm including myself in this groupis nerd speak for after eating lunchtypically it'slunch so that's actually one of thedrivers of cardiovascular pathology thatintestinal denova lipogenesis turningthat fructose into triglyceride right inthe intestine now there's a limit to howfast and how much the intestine can dothat the rest of the fructose will be uhabsorbed into the portal vein but notbefore some of that fructose will makeit further down and it will Nitro createtight Junction proteins now okay portalve the kidney portal ve goes to theliver portal vean goes from the visceralfrom the intestine to the liver no Kdoesn't feed the kidney nokidney intestine to liver okay okay butfructose nitrates tight Junctionproteins now let me explain that to youraudience your intestine is asewer definition of a sewer a pipe with in it okay that's a sewer ourintestines aresewers there's junk in the center andthe job of the intestine is to move thejunk through to the anus absorbing thegood stuff while you can the intestineis made up of cells intestinalepithelial cells that are bound togetherand they're bound with proteins thatbasically form a barrier those barrierscalled tight Junction proteins thingslike cloudin and things like that umzulin is the main one okay there areothers but zulin is the one that goes isdefective in the celiac disease whatdefines a tight Junction is it is likecompletely impermeable or semi-permeablecompletely impermeable okay unless itsfunction is inhibited turns out if youalter the um phosphorilation status orthe nitrate status of that tightJunction it will will become transientlypermeable okay and so fructose nitratesTI Junction proteins causing them to betransiently permeable allowing some ofthe junk in your intestine to getthrough into your bloodstream so this isleaky gut this is leaky gut this is whatcauses leaky gut fructose is a driver ofleaky gut got it that causesinflammation at the level of the liverwhich ultimately leads to systemicinflammation one of the reasons why HighSensi CRP sensitivity CRP is high inpatients who eat ultrapress food CRP isC reactive protein which is a marker ofa essentially inflammatory immuneresponse exactly yeah you don't want ittoo high and 93% of Americans today areinflamed does that mean that 93% ofAmericans have leaky guts yeah it doesbecause that's where it comes from so inaddition to limiting fructose

manybusinesses start off with goodintentions and drift in order to stay umto stay competitive um and many manybusinesses as we know um not all ofwhich are entirely bad such as thepharmaceutical industry right youthey're bad they're instances of likethe opioid crisis but then there aredrugs from the pharmaceutical industrythat help save lives I mean that's my mystance um the food industry I think theyare good actors and there are Bad actorsbut we're talking about the foodindustry okay well we talk about theexercise industry we talk about thepodcast industry I mean you got goodactors and Bad actors but but whatyou've alluded to several times here andyou're more informed than I am is a uha concerted effort to lace food with aform of sugar that makes people cravemore of that food and that is causingmetabolic illness disruptingmitochondria and on and on exactly andyou're the physician not me um you'veworked with patients who struggle withobesity and for various reasons um notme and um so we could probably spendhours if not days talking about all theterrible things that the quote unquotefood industry has done but what do youthink is the the pure pure motivationright I don't think that they wantpeople to be sick but they want to sellproduct and this sells more product sothen it raises twoquestions if why is it that more peopledon't know about know this informationalthough many more will know aftertoday's conversation but and certainlyin government it's it's a mix regardlessof what side of the aisle you're on orif you're right in between they'rethey're clearly people that care aboutthe health of themselves and othersso I can understand how things mighthave gotten to this point but what doyou think are the barriers to gettingpeople to appreciate just what a problemthis is and and getting people to changetheir choices in terms of what they'reeating are they truly addicted to thepoint where they are sick they can'tmake good decisions like a like a drugaddict who's highly addicted to heroinis a sick person they have an illnessand they need treatment but until theyget that treatment they can't make gooddecisions let's take an analogyalcohol 40% of Americans are tea tolersnever touch the stuff 40% don't drink40% don't drink great I'm not a big fanof alcohol I've never seen it makeanyone better at anything that reallymattered no because except drinking andmatter completely vestigal there's no uhbiochemical reaction in the body thatrequires alcohol okay for the samereason by the wayfructose um 40% are social drinkers youknow you can pick up a beer put it downI'm in that category 10% % are bingeDrinkers and 10% are chronicalcoholics okay now do youdeprive the 40% of social drinkersbecause of the20% of binge Drinkers and chronicalcoholics no I believe people should bein choice but I believe people shouldknow what they are doing so that theycan be in Choice well right like do asyou I always say uh and I said thisabout the alcohol episode which turnedout to be one of our most prolific Episepisodes where I said you know more thantwo drinks zero is better than any andmore than two drinks per week you needto do other things to offset that andit's problematic that's what those arewhat the data say but I but I would saydo as you want but know what you'redoing well so I would say that that'sexactly what the food industry wants youto think that's that is the foodindustry's Mantra is you have your ownchoice personalresponsibility so the question is doespersonal responsibility work and theanswer is no it doesn'tevery uh Public Health debacle in thehistory of mankind started out as apersonal health issue before it became aPublic Health crisis and you can pickyour uh you know personal responsibilityissue whether it be exposures whether itbe addictions whether it beinfections bottom line is ultimately itrequired a societal response okay we cantalk about syphilis we can talk abouttuberculosis ultimately needed a publichealth response we can talk about um uhteen pregnancy we can talk about tobaccotobacco ultimately needs a public healthresponse because the sheer enormity ofit and the uh the egregiousness of itrequires that public health responseWell turns out this is nodifferent in order to exercise personalresponsibility four criteria have to bemet those four criteria are thefollowing number one knowledge you haveto have the knowledge because if youdon't have the knowledge then how canyou exercise personal responsibilitywell in fact the Public's being keptfrom the knowledge we're doing this nowin part to in you know to entrain thatknowledge to to get people to understandwhat the problem is yeah I mean Iconsider myself pretty informed aboutnutrition and health butalready today I've learned two dozenfacts about processing of fructose andcalories generally that I had noknowledge of Prior well that's good okaybecause it's not about the math it'sabout the science okay they want it tobe about calories so we have this thingcalled food science we have this thingcalled nutrition and we have this thingcalled metabolic Health they are not thesame food science is what happens tofood between the ground and the mouthnutrition is what happens to foodbetween the mouth and the cell metabolichealth is what happens to food insidethe cell but all of the chronic diseasesthat we are suffering from type twodiabetes hypertension dyslipidemiacardiovascular disease cancer dementiafatty liver disease polycystic ovariandisease those eight diseases which makeup 75% of healthc care expenditures inthis countrytoday are all inside the cell becausethey are all mitochondrial dysfunctionand there is no medicine that gets tothe mitochondria although you and othersat Stanford Harvard Etc are startingthis with the metabolic Psychiatry beingone instance righted and UCSF as wellforgive me I should mentioned UCSF upfront your your home institutionwonderful institution right up the roadfrom Stanford so you know things arechanging people are starting to thinkabout mitochondrial Health they are okayso you list off the first the firstthing and you said there are four thingsthat stand is be first one was knowledgeokay second accessbecause if you don't have access thenhow can you exercise personalresponsibility access to healthierAlternatives exactly which means costeffective I mean I love berries from thefarmers market more than I love berriesfrom the store I love the farmersmarkets generally but it takes timeenergy to go there and the costs areactually lower at the level of what youhand the vendor typically right but uhvolume is tough to achieve right theyactually have me at a at a quota I'm notnot allowed to buy as many berries as Iwant because obviously there are otherpeople who want berries so there's thatright people have to feed their familythat you know and they want we're usedto eating a lot of volume but you'reable to at least go there sometimes okayyeah we're talking about people who livein quote food deserts we're also talkingabout people who live in food swampsokay when we're talking about foodswamps we're not talking about anplethora of healthy foods we're talkingabout all the junk that's what they theylive in the swamp of junk soif you live in the swamp of junk how areyou supposed to exercise personalresponsibility number three uh oraffordability so you have to be able toafford your choice and Society has to beable to afford your choice and right nowwe can't afford that choicebecause health care costs right now areat $4.1 trillion a year but like so manythings in uh behavioral economics andhealth it's so hard for people to seethat the the immediate choice is leadingto a higher cost down the road therejust too many nodes of separation forpeople to realize hey when I'm reachingfor this cereal as opposed to makingwaffles for my kids from scratch or youknow they're thinking time efficiencycost efficiency volume the kids's notthrowing Tantrums because they're not nolonger getting the cereal and it's avery difficult to see this is the reasonwhy healthc care costs are going upthere just too many nodes of separationwouldn't agree more but the ultimatelyit's because the government separatesandsilos um food industry profits fromhealth care costs if you actuallycombine those because they ultim are thesame you would see the problem soglobally the food industry grosses $9trillion a year health care costglobally cost1 trillion a year dietaryrelated health costs environmental costscost $7 trillion a year and productivitycosts cost $1 trillion a year so whenyou do the math 9 - 11 - 7 -1 means thatthere is a 10 trillion a yeardeficit because of us cleaning up themess that the food industry makes andwhile numbers like that that's notaffordable right I agree and whilenumbers like that land really hard Ifind that for myself and for many peoplestatistics like that are hard to keep inmind in a way there's something aboutthe human brain that hears that and goeswhoa we're like that War cost that muchand this food issue costs that much andthen we go to the store and we're hungryright and the kids are are are arehungry and and you're and so those nodesof Separation it's it's almost like aneural SL memory SL prefrontal cortexissue to me and of course I look ateverything through the lens ofneurobiology you know not everything butmost everything and so how how could Inot how could we not but then like theissue is well there's still food on theshelves and you know and so it's verywhat do we do to connect to bring closertogether these notes what would thegovernment do so the question is isthere food on the shelves let me finishthe fourth one and then I want to comeback to that point let me just you knowfinish a concept so affordability andnumber four externalities your choicecan't hurt anybody else but what if yourchoice does hurt somebody else so likefor tobacco secondhand smoke right foralcohol drunk driving what was theargument for teen pregnancy that someoneelse was going to have to raise the kidsexactly all right but what about forfood okay well how about the fact thatyour employer Stanford University has topay$2,750 uh per year in obesity relatedhealth care expenses that they havepassed on to you even though you're notobese that is affecting you so thatguy's obesity right there that isaffecting you ah but there

associated with all things badand and maybe we can help shift thatnarrative yeah I'm I'm very happy I meanas an endocrinologist you know this isyou know this my wheelhouse is where Ilive um cortisol is a good news bad newsdeal like so many things shortterm gainfor long-term pain okay so when you arein what we callallostasis that is perturbation ofhomeostasis that is a stress an acutestress cortisol is one of the thingsthat helps you manage that bodily andmental stress so an Englishtest a car accident running away fromthe lion you know the famous you knowpyg me running away from the lion all ofthose require cortisol in in order tomanage and mitigate that stress theupcoming 2024 election that's chronicstress that is not acute stress mean tothat's the worst that'll be the onlymention of Politics on this podcast uhand we don't have to go there but we'reall chronically stressed and we can talkabout why that is and what's going onand I'm actually very interested in thatand a colleague of mine in Paris and Ihave built a computational model of thelyic system which focuses on the stresscenter of the brain the amydala tounderstand how chronic stress isdifferent from acute stress and how thatchronic stress ultimately leads tometabolic and mental health disastervery interested in learning more aboutthat before we touch on that you'veworked a lot with kids MH um people ageas you put it 0 to19 I don't know aboutthe exact numbers but when I was growingup there were some kids in school thatwere overweight but it was theoccasional kid right now it seemsdepending on where one draws thethreshold for overweight it seems thatthere are a lot of kids that areoverweight um how about 25%obese and 40% overweight okay soobviously a serious problem Ser now andgoing forward what about adults in theUS um I remember seeing at a meeting amap of obesity in the US and um overtime and it very quickly filled in fromvery few people were obese to very manyColorado was this um was this like likeBeacon of of of fit people but now it'sno longer and that's too ohokay cool I'll tell you why there thereare four things that can increasemitochondrial uh uh uh biogenesis areyou going to tell me altitude is onecold yeah that's why Colorado is lessobese altitude that's why Colorado isless obeseand um uh what were the other two I forbut those were the reason it had nothingto do with being more fit it had to dowith cold and altitude exampleSwitzerland compared to Germany they gotthe same crappy food but Switzerland hashalf the Obesity that Germany doesbecause Switzerland is higher oh I lovethe food when I go to Munich I love theSchnitzel and wonder sourkrauts and theygot that in Switzerland too okay so theyhave great food Switzerland's less obeseright same way Colorado is less obeseit's because of the altitude you youmentioned cold U many listeners of thispodcast are at least interested in someuh also practice deliberate coldexposure cold showers cold plungesmainly for the um I think the best dataare the increases in catac colam Meesepinephrine norepinephrine dopamine thatare long- lasting people feel a bigstate shift they feel better yeah butwhen one looks at the

that'saffecting other things in terms of howcalories areprocessed or how calories are feedinginto mitochondrial function ordysfunction there I could see how itmight shift the um shift the scal so tospeak I mean cold is is an amazinglypowerful stimulus it and um I think oflight cold food movement it's kind oflike the core four ways in which you canshift physiology easily all of thesethings are

and wehave the data there is a uh uh anorganization that I absolutely want tocall out because they are you know themost egregious organ you politicalorganization on the face of the Earththey're called the American legislativeexchange Council Alec or alic and theywrite bills they are a bill Mill okayand they for whoever gives them moneyand who gives them money big Pharma bigAgra big oil and uh big food and you'reso you're including big Pharma you're aphysician you've written scripts beforeyou've written prescriptions forpatients before isn't that Pharma thatprovides the drugs that allows yourpatients to feel better well thequestion is do they do they feel betterthis is a big question let's you want togo you're writing but you're writing thescript I mean I mean I'm just trying I'mnot trying to try to challenge you but Isee so so you don't uh there have to beinstances where someone's thyroiddeficient and you give them you know adrug AB so if so if if you've got adisease and a medicine will replacewhat's missing sure okay so fordeficiency diseases which as anendocrinologist that's what I doabsolutely and I did that you know withno compunction of uh of improprietywhatsoever but that's not what we'retalking about here let's talk aboutwe're really talking about let's startwithstattin Statin lowerLDL okay does statins reduce heartdisease yes orno you know I seem to be whiffing todayon all the quizzes and it's kind ofbecoming fun for me at this level I'mgoing to go with no but but I will sayyou know my friend and I think hisexpert uh physician as well you knowPeter AA and others you know has talkedabout some of the positive attributes ofstatens in certain cases for certainPati in certain cases that's exactlyright and I completely agree and by theway Peter's a friend and you know wesomeday we'll we'll you know all youknow go out drinking together well Iwon't drink but how about we share asteak share a absolutely you got it youguys I don't I don't know if he drink hedrinks a little bit if if you'relistening okay he drinks a little bithouse on me yeah I don't do the dessertor the or the alcohol anymore but butI'm and it's not so I can live to be 120it's so I can wake up the next morningand and uh keep up with you guys it'sfine I get the so for primary preventionthat is your LDL is high you need aStatin that's primary prevention youhaven't declared yourself you haven'thad an event for primary prevention themean increase in lifespan for being on aStatin is four days four days four daysfour days so to chuckle that's that's uhand the risk fordiabetes is 20% increase what about anyImprovement in in quality of life nonefor primary prevention now for secondaryprevention for secondary in other wordsyou've already declared yourself youalready have a problem for secondaryprevention that's where Statin shine sothere's a value to them I'm not arguingthat and if you have familial hypercholesterolemia which is one in 500 okaynot do you need a Statin but you need alowfat diet and apriest okay so there is definitely avalue to stattin but not for primaryprevention but that's what everybodywhat every doctor is doing oh your LDLit's over 80 you know you need a Statinthat's ridiculous that is absolutely ajoke and the data show that in fact infact my colleague aim Malhotra in the UKparticipated in an analysis where theytook the entire UKpopulation and they took out everybodyunder age 65 so you're looking at people65 to 90 and it turned out that the LDLlevel correlated with longevity thehigher the LDL the longer they livedwhen you took out all the people who hadproblems so LDL is not really theproblem and the reason is because thereare two ldls there's one called largebuoyant there's one called small dentsturns out dietary fat raises your largebuoyant your large buoyant isirrelevant it iscardiovascularly neutral but that's theone that statinseffects the small dense that's theatherogenic particle when your smalldense LDL is high that means you are notclearing triglyceride peripherallybecause that's what small dense show youthat's that that's what happens totriglyceride is become they become smalldense can I take a guess and say thatthe best way to reduce small dens is toreduce insulin yes by reducingsugar because that triglyceride is madein the liver it's all palmitate andthat's the only fat that the liver knowshow to make and so triglyceride is yourliver output ofcarbohydrate that's how you have to lookat triglyceride so triglyceride turnsout to be much more important as acardiovascular risk factor than LDL everwas so does the does big Pharma and bigfood do they know all of this yes I knowthey know because they've told me so andbut they have statins tosell and Foods in the uh the Nova class4 mhm they know this too so you know I'man optimist or you know what what's itgoing to take to really move the needleI mean you described the four barriersum we're trying to add to the

them obviouslythere are 51 different federal agenciesthat manage our food 51 and none of themknow what the other one'sdoing and the food industry likes itthat way so communication across these51

and Drug Administrationit's the Federal Drug Administrationthey spend a lot of time on drugs theyspend almost no time on food well let'sthink about where there's been successso I can recall when people smoked onplanes I actually recall going to a gymin Europe and there was an ashtraymolded into the squat rack yep that wastelling yeah I don't see people smokingcigarettes around Stanford Hospitalanymore but I remember they initiallysaid that people couldn't smoke anywhereexcept in this one little designatedarea right and that's typically what yousee nowadays and my understanding of theanti-smoking campaign at least for kidsfor people 18 and younger was thattelling people it was bad for theirhealth didn't work showing them lungsthat were decrepit didn't work whatworked was showing them commercials ofcackling handw ring um white guys whowere talking about how much money theywere making off of these um uh naivekids who were buying cigarettes andother tobacco products so it became athe the effective campaign to endsmoking in young people was to hijacktheir re inherent rebelliousness ofYouth and then they were like no we'renot going to stick it to them like giveyou know the the as my friend calls itlike the two the two-finger businesscard like No And so that worked thatworked vaping is making a comeback wevaping is a separate episode we won'tget into that but because nicotine isstill addictive but you don't see a lotof people smoking cigarettes so itworked like something that you wouldnever imagine could ever work workedwell so yes no I mean that's part of itI'm not going to tell you that it's notit is part of it um and we actually havean example of how that could be appliedto another uh uh uh toxic substancesugar we had Berkeley versus big sodayou know that's how Berkeley ended upwith its soda tax that dates back to2015 the city of Berkeley city ofBerkeley it we just celebrated the5-year anniversary of the Berkeley sodatax and we've been able to actuallylook just stational diabetes way downobesity down slightly not a lot but alittle bit um cardiovascular diseasedown Dean Schillinger and Chris Madsonat UCSF and UC Berkeley just presentedat San

than a can of Cokethat I buy in on University Avenue inpal Alto it does huh okay by by a dimeand that was and sufficient enough to tocreate this kind of change well yes itis money hurts because money hurtsexactly soAndrew there have been four count themfour cultural tectonic shifts in Americain the last 30 years and they're allundeniable here they are number onebicycle helmets and seat bels oh yeaheverybody uses those two smoking inpublic places Nobody Does that three uhdrunk driving hopefully fewer people aredoing that four condoms and bathroomscondoms in bathrooms in bathrooms inpublic bathrooms yeah you see those moreavailable okay yeah all right 30 yearsago if a legislator stood up in a statehouse and proposed legislation for anyone of those four and I don't care ifit's an a state house or in Congress orin Parliament or in the Duma or anywhereelse in the world okay they have gottenlaughed right out of town Nanny stateliberty interest get out of my kitchenget out of my bathroom get out of my carokay today they're all facts oflife right nobody's belly aching aboutany of those the point is we were ableto solve thosefor public health debacles how did we doit how did we solve those four no onecould imagine that we would ever solvesmoking right but we did sort of I meanwe brought consumption down by half okaythat's pretty good when you think aboutfor an addictive sub how many fewerpeople are dying of lung cancer nowadaysin the US um it's like 80% lower wowwell there's also been improvements intreatment but yeah but no but it's it'sthe in diagnosed with in inci

likeis there something inherently depressingabout carrying excess adapost tissue assetting aside any kind of aesthetic umuh stuff you know how people want tolook or are perceived you know just isthere anything bad about carrying a lotof body fat independent of the metabolicsyndrome for mood and an overall senseof well-being no I'm really glad youasked that Andrew we should haveactually covered this earlier umeveryone thinks fat is fat as we'velearned fat is not fat and a fat is nota fat but um body fat is not body fatthere are three fat Depot and they aremetabolically different the first is thedoes this bathing suit make me look fatfat by the way never answer thatquestion that's called subcutaneous fator big butt fat if you will so here'sthe question how many pounds or kilos ofsubcutaneous fat do you have to gainbefore you become metabolically ill Ihave no idea about 10 kilos about 22 lbsokay why the reason is because thatsubcutaneous fat drains into thesystemiccirculation so you have to have a lot ofcyto kindes coming from thosesubcutaneous atopos sites to raise theblood level of cyto kindes to the pointwhere it starts doing damage at thelevel of the liver so fats are releasingcytoid which are pro-inflammatoryexactly and they're doing that at restany fat cell any fat cell okay any fatcell but if it's going to the systemiccirculation you have a volume ofdistribution of six liters so you haveto lose you know you have to have a lotof cyto kindes to get the concentrationup now just out of fairness to thefat how many cyto kindes does a musclecell release I mean are are we unfairlypicking on adapost tissue because whywould adapost tissue be pro-inflammatoryI mean a single fatcell I've got a fat cell sitting at youknow on my shoulder someplace right Imean I'm not zero fat at my shoulder whywould it be pro-inflammatory so in factthe fat cell itself is not here's whathappens the fat cell has a fat vacu ithas a storage place for this lipiddroplet you stuff it you stuff it youstuff it the fat vacu gets bigger biggerbigger the perpen border thatencompasses that fat vacu that itborders the the the the space ultimatelycan't get any bigger and it startsbreaking down when that happens itspills the grease into the fat cell thefat celldies becomes necrotic that calls macrasis in to clean up the grease and it'sthemacras that release the cyto kindes allright so in fact the fat cell is not theproblem it's the breakdown of the greasethat lead leads to the maccrageactivation that's the problem but whenyou do it in subcutaneous fat it's goinginto this 6 L tank and so theconcentration doesn't go up very muchso 10 kilos before you start seeing someeffect fat Depot numbertwo visceral or big bellyfat now how many pounds or kilos of bigbelly fat you have to gain before youget metabolically ill I don't know butI'm guessing it's less than 22 poundsit's way less oh for once I got ananswer right today that's right aboutfive about five poundsnow question is why number one thevisceral fat does not drain into theinto the systemic circulation it drainsinto the portal vein which goes straightto the liver so you're getting a biggerload going straight to the liver of cytokindes not to the kidney the good thingabout getting an answer wrong folks isthat you never forget the correct answerthat's why I always tell my studentsright so I'll never forget that indeedgot it and the question is what made thevisceral fat in the first place was itcalories no it's cortisol it's stressit's the combination of the sympatheticnervous system and cortisol and thereason we know this is because you cantake patients with major depressivedisorder with endogenous depression whoare suicidal who have to be admitted tothe hospital to keep themselves fromkilling themselves stick them in ascanner and they are losing subcutaneousfat like crazy because they're noteating but they're gaining visceral fatbecause of the high cortisol and thestress so there's something about theadrenocorticoid receptors in that areathat just preferentially Depot fat therewhen cortisol is high indeed becausethat's the metabolically activefat right and five pounds will do it andthen finally the third fat Depot theliver now how many pounds of fat can theliver storebefore you become metabolicallyill got to be even less because theliver is not nearly as large as the sortof abdominal region half a pound quarterof a kilo how much does a healthy liverweigh healthy liver weighs 1500grams okay okay so you know it's notvery I'm trying to translate quickly topound so we're going Metro we're going astandard so, 1500 G would be 3 lb so youknow basically half a pound okay so notverymuch because that's where the action isand so when you have fat in your liverit causes metabolic dysfunction rightaway and the question is where did thatfat come from that came from alcohol orsugar so alcohol and sugar mostmetabolically egregious because itaffects the liver directlystress second most because it affectsthe visceral fat and subcutaneous fatthe least important in terms ofmetabolic derangement so yes it may notlook good in the bathing suit but from ametabolic standpoint it is actually theleast important so the question thenbecomes all right what are you trying tofix if you're trying to fix liver fatit's really easy get rid of the alcoholin the sugar except of course they'reboth addictive will that also liberateany fat that's already in the liverabsolutely and that's one of the reasonswhy intermittent fasting works isbecause it gives your liver a chance tobasicallyoffload what it's already stored that'sone of the things that intermittentfasting will buy you is a little e uhless liver fat so that's a good thingall right now stress on the other handas you know and as we've talked aboutand as you know you've had um Dr Lissaapple on your podcast before you knowstress is tough you know trying tomitigate

your artificialsweetener so a spart tame or you know uhsuc sucos Stevia monk fruit uh um thenew ones you know yeah the one thatpeople are more excited about nowadaysis alos Al it's expensive it tends tohave less of an artificial sweetenertaste that people can detect right um soyou're saying that regardless of oh andwe should I'm remembering from thecomment section I do read themartificial sweeteners andnoncaloric sweeteners yes because themoment you say artificial people saywhat about Stevia what about Alo so solet's just say um uh non-caloricsweeteners can wrap our arms around allthat entire category sure unless we needto distinguish among the differentparticipants in that category so you'resaying that even though people can umlower their total choric intake prettyeffectively I've seen the studies thatshow if you know dieters who consume umwater only as their you know main liquidversus diet sodas with aspartametypically or Stevia the diet sodadrinkers actually lose more weight weknow that but you're saying there may bedeposition of fat in the liver in thoseindividuals be specifically because ofthe artificial sweetening because of theinsulin turns out there's still aninsulin response it's a fa very famousstudy done in um Copenhagen 100 normalindividuals 25 in four different groupsonegroup uh one uh one liter of sugaredsoda per day for six months one literthat's a lot of sugared soda yeah onegroup one liter of diet soda per day forsix months I probably did that ingraduate school one group one liter ofmilk per day for 6 months I probably didthat when I was an infant and finallyone final group one liter of water perday for six months I do that now I domore than that but yeah the one liter ofsoda per day in six months gained 10kilos the sugary soda the sugary soda 10kilos okay 10 kilos no surprise the oneliter of water per day lost two kilosalso no surprise those were the easyones now let's do the ones in the middleone liter of milk perday no change presumably that was fullfat milk we're talking about milk fullfat milk yeah they like their their fullfat milk no change why is that they'retaking on an enormous increase in totalcaloric intake I'm guessing that thereis a blunted insulin response due to thefat and the milk and also becauselactose is not a very uh uh Big Driverof insulin response and because there'sa satiety effect that's like f eat lessyeah it's like food likefood and finally the key the kicker tothe whole thing diet soda the one literof dioda what what would you predicttheir weight would do more weight lossthan in the water group based on myunderstanding of the literature theygained two kilos wild because they atemorewell you tellme why did they gain two kilos if theywere consuming a liter of Da soda whichare zero calories the answer is becausethey still generated an insulin responseand that insulin response generated morehunger more more weight and more hungerexactly and that's the key so theydidn't gain the 10 kilos they gained twokilos so it looks better compared to thesugared uh uh version but it looks likeyou know a problem compared to the waterversion or even the milk version sounless you bootstrap calories and holdthat constant you're going to see aweight gain due to artificial sweetenerin exactly right and that's been shown50 ways from Sunday at a whole bunch ofdifferent studies so compared to Sugaryeah it's better but compared to waterit's way worse and the reason is theinsulin response you put something sweeton the tongue message goes tongue tobrain Sugar's coming message goes brainto pancreas through the vus nerveSugar's coming release the insulin andso tongue doesn't know if it's sugar ornot it releases the in the pancreasreleases the insulin which drives energyinto fat whether it was you know fromthe uh diet sweetener or not I I sawsome really interesting data from DanaSmall's group at Yale showing that whenpeople have a diet soda with food sothis is like the diet coke with thesandwich or with the burger maybe evenwith the pasta the insulin resp responsefrom the food and the insulin responsefrom the diet soda are compounded butthere's a classical conditioning effectpavlovian effect such that then later ifthey just drink the diet soda they getan even bigger insulin response just tothe diet soda than they would haveoriginally if they only had the dietsoda separate from food so in otherwords the the insulin the food inducedinsulin response is conditioning agreater insulin response from the dietsoda and we actually have another studythat demonstrates the same thing out ofSingapore um teay at all uh in AmericanJournal clinical nutrition 2018 Ibelieve that looked at a similarParadigm here's what they did they tooka bunch of people and they admitted themto their Clinical Research Center fourtimes a week apart and they did them inrandom order and each time they uhstarted the morning they fasting andthey did either a sucrose tolerance testor an aspartame tolerance test or asucralose tolerance test or a monk fruittolerance test so two hours you knowingesting one of the three one of thefour and measuring glucose and Insulinover the course of the next two hoursfasted fasted okay okay then it was timefor lunch and they let them havewhatever lunch they want it was ametabolic Buffet they could eat whateverthey want wanted off thebuffet except that they were beingclocked and the same for dinner theywere being clocked but they could eatwhatever they wanted in a given periodof time in the 24 hours okay you know oryou know from 7:00 a.m. to 7:00 p.m.whenever they went home okay turned outthe sucrose tolerance test generated aninsulin response as you'd expect themonk fruit the Ste the uh U sucros andthe aspartame did not but then when theyatelunch they if they had had one of thethree diet sweeteners in the morningthey ate more at lunch and more atdinner and generated an increasedinsulin response both at lunch anddinner so that the area under the curvefor the whole day was exactly the sameso they ate a significantly more yeahyeah because they had the diet soda inthemorning Wild Well Idrink drinks that contain Stevia and Idon't

            "text": "elsewhere but based on everything youtold us of about artificial excuse melow calorie sweeteners um it makes moresense to me now why foods that are nottouted as diet foods would be laced withthings like sucralose because it shoulddrive the craving for that food throughincreases in insulin and craving ofother Foods later that day and laterthat evening is thatwhy non-caloric sweeteners are added toto all sorts of foods now that becausetypically one things noncaloricsweeteners probably only added to quoteunquote diet foods low calorie foods butthat's not you're right it's that that'snot the case and they are adding dietdiet sweeteners to foods that you didn'tknow had diet sweeteners in them that'sright um there are two reasons that thishappens one is insulin because insulinblocks leptin signaling at the level ofthe hypothalamus and the nucleusaccumbent so if it blocks leptin leptinis the hormone that your fat cells makethat tells your brain you've had enoughso if insulin blocks leptin it makes youhungrier and it also extinguishes it itit stops the extinguishing of reward bythat food so that you want more of it soit does both because leptin normallysuppresses food intake and reducescraving the analogy that comes to mindis um a slot machine that encourages youto feed more money and hit go to pullthe lever but that also blinds you tothe outcome so even if you win you don'teven know that you have wins it's alsoblinding you to your losses you'reeffectively becoming automaton yeah ofjust eating without any um kind ofconscious understanding of what you'reyou're bringing in or tasting the foodany longer exactly right it's not thislike and Anna lmy when she came on thepodcast author of dopamine nation andobviously head of our dual diagnosisaddiction clinic at Stanford talkedaboutyou know these these consumptivebehaviors where people are scrollingsocial media or consuming porn or uhconsuming drugs or alcohol in a way thatlike they're not in touch with thepleasure of the of the substance orbehavior anymore they become automatonsbut they but if they don't do it theyfeel lousy so the pleasure is gone thepain is definitely waiting tolerance anddependence that's the definition ofaddiction so dopamine is an excitatoryneurotransmitter it excites the nextneuron always there was no such thing asdopamine inhibiting a postoptic neurondopamine stimulates the next neuron andit doesn't matter which dopaminereceptor it is one through five it'salways excitatory now neurons like to beexcited that's why they have receptorsbut neurons like to be tickled notbludgeoned chronic overstimulation ofany neuron and you know this leads toneuronal cell death and the reason isbecause the neuron needs energy theneuron is the most energydependent uh tissue in the body it needsthose mitochondria to be pumping out ATPlike crazy to engage inneurotransmission well when you'refiringnonstop you risk cell death so theexcitatory neuron the the poptic neuronhas a plan B it downregulates thereceptor it downregulates the dopaminereceptor so there's less chance that anystray dopamine molecule will find areceptor to bind to and this is its PlanB in order to try to mitigate the riskofdying well what does that mean in humanterms it means you get a hit you get arush receptors go down next time youneed a bigger hit to get the same rushand receptors go down and you need abigger hit and a bigger hit and a biggerhit until finally you need a huge hit toget nothing that's called tolerance andthen when the neurons do start to diethat's calledaddiction that's what we've got andthat's what's happened in terms of foodaddictionso the question is what'saddictive is fat addictive no because iffat was addictive then all the people onthe Atkins diet or on the ketogenic dietwould be gaining weight not losing itand I'd be craving ribe eyes all day Ilike a ribeye pretty often actually butI know I know people say no but hey lookmy lipids are in in line and I I don'teat many starches and I certainly avoidsugar although now I'm thinking I mightwant to really reduce my uh low caloriesweetener intake I don't see myselfreducing my Stevia intake to zerobecause it's in some things I reallylike Andrew I am not the food police umyou know I always say that to people I'mnot a cop but the um but but but dataare data and and and Health Data are thethe the data say that that's not helpingyou any that's what the data say mhm umpoint is that the Fat's not the problemthe salt's not the problem thecaffeine's a problem really caffeine'sclassic addictive substance at everylevel yeah but in Sugar's a problem butif if one can cut out caffeine by theearly afternoon or even sooner in theday and it's not consumed to excess umand it's in the form or coffee or batesome other form that's healthy you knowis it really that much of a problem um Ilove coffee in your that's my addictionlike with a capital l underline boldface highlight I I I I I feel your painand the answer is no one has shown thatcoffee is toxic it is addictive but it'snot toxic now if you mix the coffee withalcohol now you got four Loco now it'stoxic but in and of itself caffeine isnot um toxic and that's why there's aStarbucks on every street corner but itis highly reinforcing I did an episodeon caffeine where um it covered somedata that was published in the journalscience one of the three Apex journalsum and if you put caffeine unbeknown tothe consumer into plain yogurt peoplewill crave plain yogurt indeed much moreI mean people like the feeling of beingcaffein as long as it's not creatinganxiety levels of energy exactly tostick with caffeine that's fine yeah andso will I we've been talking a littlebit about the hypothalamus

            "text": "some peripheral gut-based mechanisms forhunger and satiety right um this is agreat opportunity to talk about some ofthe glp1 agonists that are nowum widely used so things typicallycalled those zic but gp1 gluc gluconlikee peptide one right um originallydiscovered in the heila monster whicheats very seldom and some really smartbiologist I love biology like this saidhow come they don't have to eat verymuch well they their blood is loadedwith gp1 right um and so they only haveto eat one Whatever helila monsters umDelight in per year or somethingoutrageous like that humans make glp1 aswell my understanding is that gp1 thatthat not that's injected but that one ummakesnaturally is acting on both the brainand the gut to increase satiety so it isacting on the brain no argument but theprimary action is on thegut gp1 decreases the rate of gastricemptying that is its primary driver yesit does affect the brain I'm not arguingthat it does but the primary effect isto reduce the rate of gastric emptyingso you stay Fuller longer because thefood doesn't move through the stomachand the intestine interesting in SouthAmerica in uguay in Argentina it waslong thought that um yeram mateconsumption which we know very modestlyincreases glp and by the way a lot ofother things do too um that people weretaking it for its uh after meals for itslaxative effect partially that's youknow it's not pleasant for but that'salso at the colon that's at the level ofrather the stomach but it is used fairlyeffectively for people to space theirmeals without snacking that you're youknow and maybe it's the glp1 maybe it'ssomething else um but people areinjecting themselves with gp1 analogesnow $1,300 a month is that what it costthat's what it lost right um and itseems to be pretty effective at inducingweight loss although a significantamount of that weight loss seems to befrom a skeletal muscle tissue and we'reg we need to talk about that so what areyour thoughts on OIC as a as a primaryuh earlier you talked about primary andsecondary control you referred to it alittle bit differently in the context ofstatins right um so a kid comes in who'sobese or slightly overweight it's like Idon't know what to do I'm trying to eatbetter exercise or a person comes in andsays hey i' I've had a really hard timegetting that last 20 uh n pounds off forso many years will you prescribe methose mic so the short answer is numberone I'm retired so I'm not prescribinganything but let's let's let's go withthere the data show that gp1 analogeslike um semaglutide and now tepati whichis uh Li version uh Manjaro is thediabetes version Zep bound is theObesity version in the same way that OICis the diabetes version for um uhnovonordisk and wovi is the Obesityversion so they're all glp1 they're allGP gp1 analog there synthesized in a labit looks like gp1 smells like gp1 actslike gp1 when injected tepati the uhLily one actually has a dual function ituh binds to theGip recept receptor so it might havedouble duty and the data show that it'sactually even slightly more effective atWeight Loss than the Nova Nordiskversion so we'll be seeing a shift interms of uh uh consumer preference soonno doubt but here's the thing you lookat the data one year uh of treatment 16%weight loss now that sounds great andI'm not saying it's bad it's good andpeople are not craving food all the timeis that because people are feeling fulllonger right so they're eating lessthey're eating less this is the caloriein calorie out model they're eating lessand so they are losing weight I'm notarguing that and they might be cravingalcohol less According to some recentreports yeah well we can go there for aminute too in asecond here's the problem when you lookat that 16% weight loss as you just saidwhen you put people in a dexas scannerthey have lost equal amounts of fat andmuscle musle now is it good to losemuscle no it is not good ask any littleold lady who breaks her hip if she wishshe had a little bit more muscle orsomebody who dieted lost a lot of musclebecause they weren't offsetting theweight loss with resistance training orsome other form of exercise and theamount of food that they can eat inorder to maintain that weight to put itin scientific terms sucks and um youknow we mentioned Peter AA earlier okayin outlive he's made it very clear thatsarcopenia lack of muscle mass is one ofthe drivers of mortality so losingmuscle is not uh uh a a good idea butyou lose equal amounts of fat and musclewhat else causes loss of equal amountsof fat and muscle starvation in fact thereason that all these glp1 analogueswork is because you stop eating like thehe yeah just like the Heil monster theHeil monsters look pretty chubby to mewellask another heal a monster I did butunfortunately whatever answer itprovided was not interpretable indeedthe point is that starvation is not sogood and if you think about why it'sworking it's reducing gastric the rateof gastric emptying all right well itturns out that that's the reason for itsside effects the reduction in gastricemptying that's why you get nauseathat's why you get vomiting that's whyyou get painpancreatitis and most importantly nowgastroparesis your stomach turns toStone and you can't move any foodthrough your intestine at all and worseyet when you stop the medicine thegastroparesis doesn't get better this isnot a good idea this is like theopposite of the yerbamate induced effectwhich has a sort of prolax gastriemptying Maybe glp1 agonism gosh okay soit's obvious why people who've struggledto lose weight like it especially ifthey're struggled to lose weight was atleast in their mind the consequence ofbeing hungry all the time and needing toeat more or was it because of the rewardand you know theirdependence because in fact yes uh uh uhthese go1 analoges reduce reward andthat's one of the reasons why they'venoticed that you know thing uh uhreduction in alcohol consumption uh aswell and that sounds like a good thingexcept there also numerous cases now ofmajor depressive disorder in response tothese drugs so it's almost like an Altreone or something for the treatment ofaddiction which sometimes can be usefulbut now but the attempting to remove thethe um the amplitude of that rewardsignal I mean a lot on paper it makessense but the but it doesn't always playand in practice it doesn't play outthat's right and so I'm going to referyou now to an old uh literature that uhwas from 2006 there was a drug that wasapproved in Europe calledraniban okay a trade name ACC compliaand it was approved in uh Europe forweight loss and it was pretty good atWeight Loss it caused about 20% weightloss it also caused severe depressionand 21 suicidesso it's no longer available because itwas the an yeah it was pulled from theEuropean market never approved in theUnited States and the reason thishappened was because this was theanti-marijuana drug this was the anti-munchies drug this was an endoc canaboantagonist well when you reduce rewardyou also reduce your desire to live andthat's why this concern about reductionin alcohol consumption we've alreadyseen major depressive disorder inpatients receiving OIC so are we goingto see the same thing play out as we didfor rabant I'm worried about it orfenfen well fenfen didn't have um uh noit was cardiac it was cardiac right wehad cardiac problems due to thefenfluramine because of the uh serotonin1B receptor agonism right I'm justreferring to the fact that these thesequote unquote Blockbuster drugs forobesity they tend to follow a contour ofyou know very prom ing very exciting alot of people losingweight suicides or very promising a lotof people losingweight um cardiac issues very promisinglosing weight and now you're saying thestomach turns to Stone sound sounds sobiblical uh well indeed so that's thequestion and then finally we can reallytalk biblical if everyone in America whoqualified for OIC got it that would be2.1 trillion to the healthc care systemwhich is currently at 4.1 trillion sothat would be a greater than 50%increase in health carecosts okay at300 amonthconversely if we just got sugarconsumption down to USDA guidelines bybasically you know putting some limitson how much added sugar the foodindustry can put into any given productlike FrootLoops we could reduce weight by29% and save $3.0 trillion doar so we'dget better weight loss and we'd save$5.1trillion which makes more sense to theUSgovernment well earlier you werealluding to government uh big food bigPharma relationships I mean there's ahuge win here for whoever'smanufacturing these um gp1 analogesindeed um but the question is who'spaying the tab well we are um um now thequestion is why can't the government seethat and the answer is because thegovernment's on the Dole too because thegovernment uh uh through tariffs onus-made Foods okay grosses um 56 billionayear so they're a player they're notjust a regulator they're an actor toplay devil Devil's Advocate a little bitlisten I'm going to be the last personto step in and try and defend governmentas a as a unified body I'm not qualifiedto do that but you could see how it ifyou looked at it like Checkers insteadof Chess you'd say okay here's a drugthat's going to allow many millions ofpeople to reduce their overall bodyweight overall body weight is a riskfactor for a number of things um andthere will be savings on the back end asa consequence of that weight loss I meanso that's the checkers version right thechess version is how you're describingit and I think that um I meanclearly people in government are arewell most some perhaps are smart enoughto play chess not Checkers or to atleast understand it but there's verylittle incentive for the chess model soum what would quote unquote solve thisproblem is the same thing that happenedto fenfen or this Ro Roman which is ifsuddenly there's a major issue with thedrug then everyone stops taking it andtraditionally that's how it's gone itsounds like these gp1 analoges are goingto make it through the shoes though yeahImean there is a very clear downside tothese medicines on the other hand youknow there's an upside and so I'm notsad that these medicines exist I'm forthem I'm not against them I'm for themfor the right patient and right now it'snot the right patient who's getting themjust like the statens so what ifsomebody who's taking uh one of theseanaloges makes it a point to doresistance training and here you knowyou mentioned bodybuilders earli I'm notI'm not suggesting they becomebodybuilders but we now know and I thinkpetera and others would agree thateverybody should be doing some form ofmuscle loss offsetting resistanceexercise agree at least past you knowtheir reaching their adult height orsomething you know I know there arethose that say weight training doesn'tblunt your height but anyway let's justsay that from early 20s onward doingespecially especially if you're on thesemedicines right in order to maintainmuscle mass right so that's a differentpictureright um people are drinking lessalcohol again I'm playing devil'sadvocate here um so if we look at thesethese compounds not in a vacuum but okaythe person who's been carrying thatextra 30 pounds is now only carrying afew extra pounds of adapost tissuethey've lost a lot of muscle but nowthey feel well enough to exercise um thedepression part worries me yeah butanyway I'm just I'm just trying to roundthe Contour of it what we've seen inchildren you know because that's who Itook care of was was that often theyneeded a jump start okay and there weredifferent ways to get them to jump startstomach stapling well that's not jumpstart that's but that was what a lot ofpeople did I know I have a friend he'she was and sadly still is really big andhe always talked about the stomachsaving like if I could just get 50pounds down quickly then I couldexercise but exercise is painful thiskind of thing and and sadly he's he'scontinued to maintain or creep up in ina very excessive weight and that's thepoint is you know that this concept ofjump start actually if if you're onlydoing it yourself doesn't really workand the question is why is his weightcreeping up if he's had the stomachstapling the answer is because he's asugar addict yeah he's definitelyaddicted to the super big gulp soda andif you drink your calories it doesn'treally matter does it no and and he'sgot such terrible psoriasis and jointpain and all this that the prospect ofexercising is like a you might as welltell him to to like flap his wings andgo to Mars you know fructose is a driverof immune dysfunction if he got off youcan tell him from me if he got off thesugar his psoriasis would get better hisweight would get better his arthritiswould get better and he could have thenthat jump start this is a perfectexample to bridge to the brain componentof all this because I've long wonderedbased on what I understand about neuralcircuitry andneuroplasticity I know we share in thisknowledge that at some point carrying alot of adapost tissue means that thebrain sort of represents the bodydifferently I mean we know there arethese these somatotopic M maps of selfum you know but that the neuralMachinery in the hypothalamus sure whichis responsible for Motivated States Etcbut but also just the entire mapping ofthe self yeah changes in other words ifone is fat long enough mhm that itbecomes increasing ly hard to get to ahealthy weight because of the way thatthe neural circuitry is impacted itbasically remaps to maintain that thatum fat person not necessarily even justat the level of appetite but just interms of what do you what do big animalsdo I had a bulldog that weigh 90 lbBulldog Mastiff he was very economicalwith his movement right he was extremelypowerful he could run at least in whenhe was younger but if he could be stillhe was still as opposed to certainsmaller animals that are like pereticright because because he was leptinresistant so leptin as we talked aboutbriefly is um the hormone that tellsyour brain you've had enough if you areleptin sensitive you are happy to burnif you are LEP and resistant your brainthinks you're starving and if your brainthinks you're starving it's going toaffect your behavior in two ways it'sgoing to make you want to eat and it'salso going to make you want to conservebecause the goal is to try to increasethe leptin levels in order to overcomethat resistance which of course you cannever do because all you're going to dois lay down more fat and make moreleptin that makes so much sense becauseleptin comes from the adapost tissueexactly so that leptin resistance iswhat you have to be able to breakthrough you have to fix the leptinsensitivity well what's the driver ofthe leptin resistanceinsulin insulin inhibits leptinsignaling and it does it at threeseparate places in the palc neuron theproopiomelanocortin neuron in thehypothalamus it does it at um irs2insulin receptor substrate 2 it does itat socks 3 suppressor of cyto signaling3 and it does it at pip 3 phospholeandosol triphosphate those threeseparate arms of the uh uh leptinreceptor are all basically put to sleepby high insulin insulin blocks Le insignaling so the higher the insulin goesthe more your brain thinks you'restarving and the more your brain thinksyou're starving the hungrier you get andthe less you want to move so thegluttony and sloth that we've beentalking about all all you know podcastis really biochemical it is secondary tothis phenomenon of insulin blockingleptin signaling you got to fix thatfirst get the insulin in down any wayyou can and the best way get rid of therefined carbohydrate andsugar that's where youstart it makes so much sense it workstoo how about that that's always good itis I once heard you say I think it wasin a conversation with Peter AA on his"

Tech great thank you for thatsorry Munch Munch marketing team but yougot to munch munch to a new product nameum but it sounds like a a veryinteresting product and it actuallyanswered my next question which wasabout um fiber supplements fiber is goodbut there are two kinds of fiber there'ssoluble and there's insoluble they arenot the same so soluble is what goesinto Fiber One bars you know thatpsyllium uminulin uh um uh uh pectin like whatholds jelly together um that's good I'mnot saying it's bad but you need theinsoluble fiber the cellulose thestringy stuff in celery the cardboard ifyou will um together they form this gelthat we talked about earlier if you onlyconsume the soluble fiber which is whatthe food industry will add to to foodbecause the insoluble fiber is notmissible if you only add the solublefiber back you're not getting thebenefits of the entire fibercomplement earlier when talking aboutthe Nova system and uh how most all ofour food so n let's say I know it was 7to 10% let's say 95% let's air on theside of better uh 95% of our food shouldcome from Nova System class one or classtwo Foods or three or three okay stayingaway from those um Nova class 4 Foodscould you give us some examples of Novaclass one and Class 2 Foods um just BRbroadly speaking okay Nova class one isany food without alabelperiod if you see a label on a food it'sa warning label well there's groundground beef has a label okay so that'swell does it so you're talking aboutApple well when I buy it it has a labelI'm asking this because people are goingto wonder so well it doesn't have anutrition facts label is there anutrition facts label on a thing ofground beef I buy that that uh groundbeef where I consume venison um where ifyou flip it over it says how manycalories how many protein so there's alabel um but but it's just beef forvenison okay then that's class one okayegg egg is class one so and then ofcourse fruit apples orange okay so itdoesn't matter if it has a has a name aname tag as long as it it doesn't havean ingredient lab got it real food doesnot need a label it's only if they didsomething to it that it needs a label soyou have to look at every label as awarning label now the problem with thelabel is it only tells you what's in thefood what you really need to know iswhat's been done to the food becauseit's the ultr processed food that's theproblem they don't want to tell you thatthat's secret okay secret from aproprietary standpoint but also secretbecause if you knew what they did to ityou wouldn't need it you would never buyit and they don't want you to know sothey only tell you what's in the foodthat's not what's important it's what'sbeen done to the food that's importantand that's why this Nova class 4 is soimportant and that's why perfect is soimportant because it'll do the work foryou okay well definitely um providelinks to all of theseso if you could pick one thing to"

if youcould recommend one thing that thegeneral public can do to try and umassist in this advocacyfor not redefining but actually clearlydefining what is food and what isn't andmaking people aware um at the level ofpolicy and change and school lunches Imean if there were one thing what can wedo I mean I I you've clearly activatedmy neurons surrounding like the the theset of problems that exist and the pathsto correct them but should we be writingto our Congress people should we be umgetting angry at hospitals becausethey've got all these fast food machinesand that the cafeteria food is like islike is like illness promoting at UCSFwe've gotten rid of oil sugar beverageswe have the healthy beverage initiativeso no Coke machines at UC No Cokemachines at ucss wow Stanford check thatout because you know people always sendme pictures of the of the coke machinesin the school of medicine I'm likelisten I didn't put him there but I I Iuh we have to model for the public youknow I mean where where was the firstplace that smoking was banned hospitalsokay because we knew so if you get ridof the you know uh uh soda if you getrid of the sugared soda at the hospitalyou're telling people something so yeahI think that every hospital and reallyevery public venue in America needs toclear out the junk so post photos ofjunk that are supposed to be in uh inhealth promoting institutions and um Iguess the we're trying to cancel junkfood we're trying to cancel junk foodI'm pretty opposed to cancel culture buthere we go we're going to cancel ummarvelous it's actionable it'sstraightforward it's low cost low timeinvestment zero cost um very low timeinvestment so thank you for that andlook up eat real because we're doing itfor your kids so you need to helpsupport it any school district inAmerica can do it so what do we do wehave a business model whereby the uhFood Services director um eitherpurchases or rents a dilapidated Factoryin the center of the district repurposesit into a food preparation facility theycan make 27 to 30,000 meals a day okaywith a you know Skeleton Crew and thenthey and and you control what's in itand because you're buying in volume itactually reduces the cost so it'scheaper than buying it from Cisco oraromar or sedexo or wherever and thenyou farm it out via you know truck orbus all the different schools so everykid gets a hot meal made from scratcheach day and we can solvethisproblem can't help but ask this one lastquestion for people that want to cut outsugar which you clearly stated is themost important thing to do for one'sHealth how do we know how much sugar isin something I so should people belooking at labels and just looking forhow how much sugar how much carbohydrateor could we even go so far as to say ifit says um high fructose corn syrup thenit's it's on the nfly list don't don'tdon't eat it so the problem the problemis that there are 262 names for sugarand the food industry uses all of themand the reason they use all of them isbecause they can include a differentsugar as number five number six numberseven number eight number nine on thelist when you add it up it becomesnumber one they hide in plain sight andthey do it onpurposenow do I expect everybody to memorizeall 262 names no of coursenot can you figure it out yourself wellthe answer is no unless they have theline where it says added sugars if itsays added sugars it is either sucros orhigh fructose corn syrup no one's addinglactose okay that's not Happ or glucosethey're not even adding adding glucosebecause glucose isn't that sweet glucoseis not that interesting you don't seepeople going around chugging Kos syrupdo you okay that's glucose who caresyeah might be good in the Molassescookie but that's it all right so it'sfructose so you need to know what's beenadded so if it says added sugars that'sa good place to start no greater thanone teaspoon per serving no greater thanfour gam per serving of added sugarsanything greater than that leave at thestore and aim for those Nova type typeone for no aim for Nova types one twoand three and if you don't know whetherit's Nova type one two or three you canuse perfect and if you don't look atthat then go look at the nutrition factslabel and anything that has more thanfour ingredients is Nova class 4 Robertlustig thank you so much you've providedsuch an incredible educ education innutritional biochemistry the processingof fat protein carbohydrate sugarfructose in particular the cleardetriments of consuming fructose on somany different organ systems I love lovelove that you separated out food scienceNutrition andmetabolic health or self that's just Ithat's a you know that's a gazilliondollar delineation for people tounderstand and to shape theirunderstanding of all the informationthat's out thereand bins into these different categoriesyou've given us so many actionable toolsum new conceptual Frameworks you givenus a real tour to force today in a justoh so clear language so I want to thankyou I've learned a ton and um and I knoweveryone else has as well and if peoplehave questions they can of course putthem in the comment section on YouTubethat's the best place we'll providelinks to all the the companies and uhwebsit ites that that you referenced andsome of your other work and listen Ijust I'm so so grateful that you existand that you've done the

    "episode_summary": "In this episode, we address the \u201ccalories in- calories out\u201d (CICO) model of metabolism and weight regulation and how specific macronutrients (protein, fat, carbohydrates), fiber, and sugar can modify the CICO equation. My guest is Dr. Robert Lustig, M.D., neuroendocrinologist, professor of pediatrics at the University of California, San Francisco (UCSF), and a bestselling author on nutrition and metabolic health.\nWe cover how different types of sugars, specifically fructose, sugars found in liquid form, taste intensity, and other factors impact insulin levels, liver, kidney, and metabolic health. We also explore how fructose in non-fruit sources can be addictive, acting similarly to drugs of abuse, and how sugar alters brain circuits related to food cravings and satisfaction.\nThe discussion then shifts to the role of sugar in childhood and adult obesity, gut health and disease, and mental health. We delve into how the food industry uses refined sugars to create pseudo foods and the implications of these on the brain and body.\nThis episode is replete with actionable information about sugar and metabolism, weight control, brain health, and body composition. It ought to be of interest to anyone seeking to understand how specific food choices impact the immediate and long-term health of the brain and body.\nFor show notes, including referenced articles and additional resources, please visit hubermanlab.com.\nThank you to our sponsors\nAG1: https://drinkag1.com/huberman\nEight Sleep: https://eightsleep.com/huberman\nLevels: https://levels.link/huberman\nLMNT: https://drinklmnt.com/huberman\nAeroPress: https://aeropress.com/huberman\nMomentous: https://livemomentous.com/huberman"
