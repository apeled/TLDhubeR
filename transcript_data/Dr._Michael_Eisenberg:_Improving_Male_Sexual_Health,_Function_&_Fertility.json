            "text": "been looking forward to talking to youfor a long time because these days wehear a lot aboutthe diminishing quality of sperm whichin some way seems to be tacked to theconversation about diminishing qualityof environmentpeople intelligence you know there's alot woven into this statement that spermquality is declining and some of it Ithink people assume is related toenvironmental changes some of it I thinkpeople assume it are related to changesin Behavior years so maybe less exerciseless sunlight who knows hopefully you'lltell us what's really going on but thefirst question I have is is spermquality actually declining andregardless what is sperm quality yeahgreat question so I think it's verycontroversial I think as your questionalludes to so I think we'll start byjust talking about what sperm quality isand why it's important so forreproduction as you've covered on thepodcast before a man makes semen um andthat has sperm in it and so when we'retalking clinically about a semenanalysis there's a few things we look atwe look at the amount of ejaculate sementhat comes out we look at the sperm howmany there are we look at their motilityor Movement we look at their morphologyor shape there's some more advancedtesting that's done in rare caseslooking at like fragmentation of DNA forexample or there's some newer testslooking at epigenetic profiles of spermuh but essentially these are all markersor fertility so fertility in itself is ateam sport right so it's hard to youknow M label a man as fertile or notfertile without knowing about hispartner um but nevertheless based ondifferent these different parameters wetry and quantify How likely a man is tobe able to achieve a pregnancy so theWorld Health Organization every decadeor so looks over the existing literatureand defines these different cut pointsof what's normal or what's subfertile uhfor those levels so that's sort of thebackdrop of what Seaman is and how youknow these these tests are done or youknow what these tests represent now thequestion of whether they've declinedover time um has been you know aquestion for a number of years there wasa landmark paper in the early 90s byCarlson and a group in Denmark thatshowed this temporal decline you knowover the last 50 years from that timepoint and so what the investigators haddone is looked over the literature forstudies that reported semen qualityaround the world and noted that you knowthe quality in the earliest studies likein kind of the mid uh 20th century werehere and then over time they had sort ofdeclined the more recent studies um nowthat study was very controversial therewas questions about waiting fromdifferent studies putting because youcan imagine these there's not a lot ofearly studies so putting a lot moreimportance on those rather than some ofthe later ones um and so since thenthere's been many other studies thathave that have come out in time and eventoday it remains very controversial Ithink you know if I were to say that Ibelieve there's a decline some of mycolleagues and friends would be veryupset with me if I say I don't believeit some of my colleagues and friendswould be very upset with me so I wouldsay that you know my opinion reallyvaries based on Whose paper I've readand I there's some very convincing youknow studies uh on each side of it youknow there most recently just in thelast year or so there was a metaanalysis of you know tens of thousandsof men where they looked at again a hostof these studies over the last uh numberof decades all around the globe so priorstudies who really just focused on theWestern Hemisphere Western countriesbecause there was more data from thatbut more recently we've gotten a lot ofdata from Africa from Asian countries aswell uh and those also support thisdecline um so you know one of thecounterarguments to why we're seeingthat is just sort of an evolution oftechniques over time um so that's one ofthe the sort of the popular um questionsabout whether there's really a truedecline um you know I think as you'realluding to why there would be declineis also you know unknown and but you'vesort of labeled you know perfectly thekind of most common hypotheses sowhether there some environmentalexposures right a lot of things havechanged over the last 50 years and Ithink you know chemical exposure iscertainly one of those and there havebeen some fairly convincing you knowpre-clinical studies so you know mostlydone in animals uh that show that likeexposure to different chemicals thetesum or BPA other things may actually harmyou know reproductive function for menand for women as well uh and so it maybe that you know these chemicals youknow that are that we're being exposedto as kids and adults or even probablyum more sinisterly when we're um youknow kind of developing in utero thatmay be kind of the most harmful exposureum but there's also been you know anobesity epidemic as well and there's astrong link between a men man'sreproductive function um and body weightand so that's also um to play a role insome of this too um so I think there areconvincing studies but the other I guessaspect to this is that there'svariations in semen quality around thecountry and around the world there'sGeographic variation and so that's alsosort of an unknown um uh explanation uhyou know there could be different sortof genetic you know compositions of menand so there's different reproductivepotential in that Source there could bedifferent environmental exposures dietexercise lifestyle and there's a famousstud study um done a number of years agowhere they looked at se quality amongfathers so these are men that hadachieved a pregnancy and at the firstyou know prenatal visit they had um thefathers give a seaman sample and so thiswas done in four centers around thecountry I think it one in Californiathere was um I think one in the midwestuh there was one in New York so theybasically found that steam inequalitywas sort of highest in the urban centersin New York tended to be the highestnumbers where was you know lower in theMidwest and so the hypothesis waspotentially because it was a more ruralsetting maybe there was pesticideexposure and that had led to these lowernumbers but you know another equallyplausible explanation may be that youknow different sort of a differentpopulation and maybe you know that thatcould explain these differences so Ithink it's it's you know very importantum and I think you know one of the sortof lacking things in this is there's notreally longitudinal data one of thegreatest things would be if we juststarted tracking um seen quality aroundthe country just like we do obesity likeyou know n Hayes cdc's uh survey ofHealth in in the us if we added seenquality onto that that way you couldreally see you know how it varies aroundthe country and you know sort of comparelike to like to see over time if there'sreally this progression you know one ofthe only studies to do that in Denmarkum that started around you know around2000 and track Seaman quality among umyou know volunteers that came in whenthey were conscripted for militaryservice in Denmark they were offered theopportunity to participate in this studyum and so some men did and what theyfound is actually that se quality wasfairly uniform over about 20 years wherethey had data but sort of another veryinteresting part of that study is thatonly about a quarter of those men hadnormal Seamon quality um so it sort ofvery concerning you know it was I guessreassuring that it wasn't furtherdeclining but very concerning that onlya quarter of Danish men had you knownormal semen quality and they're one ofthe I think thought leaders in thisfield um just because sort of areproductive of Crisis there youmentioned that some of this apparent"

            "text": "decline in seaming quality might berelated to the fact that the tools tomeasure seaming quality are gettingbetter and better and that would makesense if for instance one is justlooking at total volume morphology whichmeans shape I should have clarified thatum how many forwardly motile sperm thereare and then also adding in you know avery sensitive measure such as um DNAfragmentation you know as theinstruments get finer and finer youdiscover more and more details and ifyou are um rating quality along a numberof different dimensions then it wouldmake sense that those would tear outinto different levels so if one were toSimply ask for couples who want to getpregnant and assuming that egg qualityis not theissue what percentage of failures toachieve successful pregnancy are theconsequence ofdeficient sperm deficient in any way andis that number increasing over time yeahso I think that's really key I thinkwhen couples think about fertilityusually it's thought of as a femaleproblem um and I think there's justhistoric reasons for that you know ifyou look at data in the US when couplesdo seek care for fertility the man hasbypassed probably a third of the timeeven though when you look at the reasonsfor infertility man contributes probablyhalf of the time to infertility so Ithink a half half yeah so I thinkthere's a huge need just to understandand evaluate the man and one of thereasons for this I think is that um youknow one of the main treatments forinfertility in the US is IVF which isvery powerful I think one of the youknow greatest marvels of medicine inprobably the last you know quartercentury is our ability to mix a spermand egg in a dish and create a life it'sreally remarkable but because it nowtakes just a single sperm you knowthrough something called iny plasmicsperm injection where you can inject oneegg or one sperm into an egg you knowthe bar has gone down dramatically youknow if a couple's just trying withoutyou know any assistance probably need 20to 40 million moving sperm but now withyou know these remarkable techniques youjust need one sperm um and so because ofthat you know I think a lot of ourInnovation and research on malefertility has probably gone to theWayside just because clinically you knowwe just need you know a few dozen spermfor mostcouples what about testosterone levelsare those also declining we hear this umand when I look at the literature I canfind evidence for that but the questionis also whether or not the amount ofdecline in testosterone levels issignificant in a way that impacts let'ssay fertility but also um Vitality inother ways energy mood um Sexual HealthEtc U what's the story with testosteronelevels are they indeed declining onaverage across the male populationin the US and elsewhere I think there ispretty convincing evidence that that ishappening and I think the reason forthat again is probably not certain butyou know there have been you know somepretty nicely designed cohort studieswhere they've recruited you know men inthe the 2000s the '90s the 80s and youcan see that depending on when these menare recruited just you know matching agefor age these testosterone levels tendto be lower um and then enh Hanes whichis again this sort of longitudinal studyrun by the CDC um that is o shownlooking at testosterone levels over youknow decades the testosterone levelshave declined over time um so there youknow chemical exposure is one possibleexplanation again either in adult oradolescent life or in utero um butobesity I think is also sort of aconvincing explanation is we're moresedentary um you know we get biggerthat's one of the places thattestosterone can decline I think there'sdifferent sort of explanations for thatum you know as testosterone's producedit's aromatized in U peripheral tissueyou know fatty tissue fat has a lot ofthis aromat taste so that convertstestosterone to estrogen so itnecessarily you know lowers thetestosterone level that's circulating inour body um also just insulating the thetesticles our thighs get biggerinsulating the testes can also sometimeslower the efficiency of production alittle bit too because of heat effectsbecause of heat effects yeah I was goingto ask about this later but I'll askabout it now since we're talking aboutheat effects and um sperm andtestosterone um The Heat Of course beingnot good for um sperm health andtestosterone which is I've read ametaanalysis I don't know um how highquality it is but um that explained thatthere is some evidence for um eitherheat effects or possibly non-heatrelated effects of cell phone you knowsmartphone in the pocket impairing spermHealth maybe even testosterone levelsnow you hear this more often often inkind of bioh hacky um I don't know uhcircles um which you know I'm not a fanof the word biohacking um ites it's notclear what it means but it it it soundslike it means something about taking ashortcut using one thing for a purposeit wasn't intended but you know it alsomakes sense to me that a smartphonecould generate some heat um someradiation that might impair umtesticular function and therefore impairsperm quality and or testosterone levelsbut is there any real solid data thatcarrying your cell phone in your pocketlet's assume on that the cell phone ison is bad for sperm health ortestosterone levels yeah so um I thinkthere's not convincing evidence thatit's going to help um testosteronelevels I think that you know it's G tohurt testosterone it's not going to hurtyeah so I should you know make clearthat I think that in terms of productionand heat effects you know spermproduction is much more sensitive thantestosterone prodction production um butthere have been some studies looking atcell phone exposure because again you'regetting this whether it's heat whetherit's sort of the you know radiofrequency you know waves coming in Ithink you could posit sort of differentexplanations of why that may be harmfulso there have been some studies that youknow looked early on you know men thatEd cell phones more or less they hadlower semen quality if they used it morebut you can also imagine there's hugedifferences in men that do and do notuse cell phones so you know it's it'sit's a hard experiment to design butthere been some studies uh doing this invitro so in the laboratory so taking youknow sperm in a cup basically andputting a cell phone next to it or notnext to it to try and see if that playeda role there have been studies donewhere they um sort of normalized the theheat you know they kind of put on umsort of a special stage so that it's notheat necessarily but maybe it's RFexposure so those studies I think don'tshow sort of a me a clinicallymeaningful change but there have beensome studies that say that maybe DNAfragmentation of sperm can go up alittle bit if there's close proximity uhto a cell phone um so I think you knowwhen patients ask me that which is acommon question I get in clinicobviously patients are coming in theywant to do you know whatever they can umto try and improve their chances um so Ithink generally I think the data is notconvincing um but you know if it's easyenough certainly to be aware of it youknow I think putting a laptop on a deskrather than in your lap I think for heatexposure is probably the biggest thingthat we want tominimize

happen to knowthrough the field of BehavioralEndocrinology as it's typically studiedin animals so most of that book centerson animal studies but there's a afraction of the studies that Center onhuman uh data and there was a veryinteresting graph that showedtestosterone levels as a function of agein males um and as one might expecttestosterone levels were on average muchhigher in late teens early 20s 30s andthere was a progressive decline but whatwas remarkable to me about that graph isthat even when exploring the um theScatter Plots because they showedindividual points they didn't just showthe averages of testosterone levels inmen in their 50s 60s 7s 80s even 90sthere were these outliers these guys whohad testosterone levels that were on parwith uh testosterone levels of men intheir 30s but these guys were in their50s 60s 7s 80s even 90s so do youobserve this clinically Do You observethat um men are coming in you know a whoare older than 40 and have testosteronelevels and presumably free testosteronelevels as well um that are still veryhigh you know and the reason I askedthis is I think we've all been told andwe presume that testosterone levelsdecline with age and one would expectsome outliers and of course we don'tknow whether or not those guys in their90s who have the testosterone levels ofthat match the averages of men in their30s didn't have even greatertestosterone levels in their 30s butgiven that they were sealing out around900 nanograms per deciliter you knowtoward the high-end normal depending onthe scale um in already at age 90 it'skind of hard to imagine that earlierthey're walking around with you know2,000 nanogram per deiler testosteroneso do you see this are there some isthere just a lot of natural variation intestosterone levels of men who walk intothe clinic at any age and of course whatis special about these individuals thatare you know maintaining high normaltestosterone levels into their uh lateryears yeah that's a great question Ithink this is such a common questionanytime we talk about testosterone Ithink anytime we talk about most sort ofuh clinical tests that we do you knowwhat is average what is normal um so wedo see great variation I mean I thinkjust like you're saying I usually leteverybody know that you know usuallytestosterone peaks you know kind ofearly 20s and it tends to go downprobably 1% a year forever uh but thereare people that have very you know veryvery high levels I you know justmirroring you know that graph that youdescribe I certainly have patients youknow we screen for testosterone levelsyou know when patients come in withcomplaints or we're worried about thatlow energy level you know low libidosome of the symptoms of low testosteronesexual dysfunction and you know to mysurprise sometimes these men you knowI've seen 80-year-olds that certainlyhave the highest testosterone level I'llsee you know for 6 months um you knowwhy that is I think is not certain maybeit has to do with you know I think witheverything there's probably sort of abell-shaped curve and everybody's alittle bit different um but Androgensensitivity you know sensitivity of thereceptor you know they make it moreefficiently but I have not reallynoticed again because at least inclinical practice you know when patientscome in they come in with a complaintand so even men you know with very highlevels they may have some of the samedysfunction men with low levels so Ithink with low levels you can try andtreat that and that may be the solutionbut for men with you know these what wewould consider high levels um you knowthere may be other issues goingon let me frame the question I was goingto ask a little bit differently whensomeone comes into your clinic and youmeasure their testosterone levels as youmentioned they're likely coming inbecause they have some issue prostateissue sexual function issueEtc but you do get a read on their youknow s morphology of their body right soyou could visibly determine whether ornot they're likely to be obese or not umregardless of age so earlier youmentioned obesity as a risk factor forlowering testosterone and sperm qualityyou mentioned that fat aromatizestestosterone into estrogen so that's atleast one mechanism by which that couldhappen but if you were to just step backand say okay if somebody who walks intomy clinic tends to be um let's sayhealthier looking you know not obeselet's just put the cut off at what youwould presume is obese um is there ahigher probability that theirtestosterone levels are going to bewithin normal range conversely whensomebody walks in and theirobese do you fully expect theirtestosterone levels to besubnormal um or are you sometimes seeingobese people walking in with you knowhigh testosterone um and the reason I'masking this is not to create confusionis that I think that everybody out therewho's thinking about sperm quality andtestosterone levels and this uh apparentdecline trying to figure out you knowokay what can we do in order to maintainthe health metrics that are going to ofcourse increase fertility but for thosethat don't want to have kids or alreadyhave kids are going to at least maintainor improve Vitality is obesity reallythe thing to avoid so is there a not onefor one but is there a tight correlationbetween obesity and testosterone levelsI would say that you cannot predict Ithink that sort of would be thetake-home and so I think that you knowmore information is always better youknow when I see patients in clinic umyou know some patients are walkingaround you know with everything istotally normal they're very healthy allthe numbers come in at the normal rangebut sometimes when men you know looktotally normal they talked about takingcare of their life they exercise youknow five seven days a week theirtestosterone levels can be very low soeven despite you know having what wewould consider should really give themyouknow symptoms um they're able tocompensate you know maybe they've livedtheir whole life in that they don't knowwhat normal is now we get them you knowto sort of normal levels a lot of timesthey feel better again because they haveno idea how they should feel um but Ithink that that's just sort of importantthat everybody you know should bescreened I think that you knowtestosterone seman quality they've beenshown to even be barometers of Health umso you know men with lower testosteronelevels of higher risk of you know heartdisease diabetes mortality the samestudies exist for semen quality as wellum and you know again they may have sortof a similar relationship andexplanation why that may be but I thinkit's hard to just predict you know basedon appearance what you know Testo willbe what seam equality be what testicularfunction will be without actuallygetting some objective data and actuallyif you look at the trend of test of seamin quality decline over time kind ofgetting back to some of those earlierpoints you're making if you were toOverlay that on the known associationbetweenobesity um its effects on SE qualitythat actually doesn't explain the wholedecline because the you know thepurported decline in seam quality isabout 50% but if you just if you were tosay well what would we expect if youknow we look at you know because we wereable to track exactly how much fatter weare now than we used to be that actuallyonly explains about a 10% decline so Ithink there is you know to your pointsomething more um and it is notsomething that you can just identify byeye what are the dos and don'ts as itrelates to I don't want

optimal is aday-to-day thing um at least but whatshould people avoid in order to gettheir sperm quality as high as possibletheir testosterone level again here Ihave to be careful I don't want to sayas

setting asideany prescription clinical treatmentsthat such as testosterone injections orthings like uh chonic gatr human coronand gatot Trope and things we can talkabout a little bit later but what shouldevery male be doing in order to optimizethese Health parameters yeah so I thinkthat there are some risk factors that wedo like we'll start with steam inquality so we talked about heat I thinkthat's a big one so like hot tub saunastry and avoid those some you know lightdata on seat warmers anytime you know wekind of get this external heat source tothe scrotum you know the testicles areoutside the body because they need to bea little cooler so anything that warmsthem up can certainly be a problem couldI just briefly interrupt there um to askwe've done episodes on sauna and some ofthe health benefits of sauna um is itsufficient for somebody to bring in acold pack to the sauna and put that intheir groin I actually have suggestedthat that's actually what I do when I gointo the sauna um and I have suggestedthis on podcasts um not just for peoplewho are trying to conceive because itseems like heat as you mention is badfor sperm not quite as bad fortestosterone levels but is it also truethat heating the testicle too much isgenerally bad for endocrine function inmales and therefore would if one isgoing to go into a hot sauna for 20minutes or more to essentially cool thethe scrotal area yeah I mean I think thespermatogenesis or sperm production iscertainly a lot more sensitive you knowwhether you can sort of thwart theeffects of external heat with a coolingpack I think it makes sense there arestudies that have looked at differentways to cool the scrotum and havecompared you know semen quality beforeand after and there's some data that mayhelp um it just depends how long you'regoing to spend in the sauna and how coldyou know that pack is going to remain soice pack and in the sauna for 20 to 45minutes and is the ice pack still coldafterwards yeah yeah they actually selland by the way I have no relationship toany of these companies but they actuallysell cold packs that are designed to beworn in your short so if you go to a youknow I'll go to a Russian B every oncein a while now I guess I'm outing myselfyes I have a yes I have a cold pack inmy shorts when I go to the Russian B umbut um but they have a a sort of aninsulation so that you're the cold thevery cold surface is cold enough butit's not right up in contact with thescrotal skin because that could get um Iwant to make a bad joke and say it couldget sticky uh that situation you youdon't want it get being so cold that itactually would stick to the skin andthen it could potentially damage theskin when you try to remove the coldpack so it has a thin insulating layerum and uh yeah that's essentially whatit is yeah I mean frostbite to thescrotum is not theoretical it couldcertainly happen so you do want to becareful so I mean in theory that shouldbe that should be adequate to sort ofyou know to decrease the risk of thatparticular effect um you know I keepcoming back to health how important thatis to maintain um you know know adequatesperm production because I think thesetwo are very linked you know there havebeen studies that show that men withmore com morid conditions so obesityhypertension hyper lipidemia as thesesort of Stack Up we see a decline intesticular function so lowertestosterone levels and lower spermquality so I think you know takingownership of your your health I think isimportant as well um you know a lot oftimes um fertility tends to be one ofthe first touch points that some menhave with Healthcare you know becausegenerally what brings men to the doctorit's usually pain or you know kind of aproblem um so you know if men are intheir 20s and 30s getting ready to starta family or 40s in some cases sometimesthey haven't you know seen a primarycare doctor so some of these things someof this relationship has not beenestablished yet so I think you knowthinking about ways to start that Ithink would be important too um and thenI know you don't want to talk abouttestosterone but testosterone isactually a fairly common problem that wesee in fertility clinics um I would saythat you estimat say maybe about one in20 infertile men are that way because oftestosteroneso I think when you know people gettestosterone different places andhopefully you know whatever provideryou're getting it from tells you thatone of the side effects of this um islower sperm production it's actuallybeen tested as a contraceptive and youknow with some other agents it canactually be fairly effective so we justwant to make sure that you know if menare starting testosterone they're doingit for the right reasons and they'redoing it safely I think talking abouttestosterone replacement therapyalthough as we were talking about beforewe started recording I I am really on apush now to rename what people call trttestosterone replacement therapy becauseindeed some people have low testosteroneand need it replaced the r in trt but Ithink what you're referring to if I'mnot mistaken is that there are probablyMillions yeah of young men and older mentaking exogenous testosterone injectionscreams pills pellets you know any numbernasal sprays now you know any number ofdifferent routes of delivery ofexogenous um testosterone and that umdramatically reduces one's endogenoustestosterone production and dramaticallyreduces one's sperm count and maybe evenquality we'll maybe talk about this alittle bit later but maybe even canthere there's I've been told that it canperhaps introduce a DNAfragmentation uh within the remainingviable sperm as well so do I have thatcorrect you're saying that that you seeone 120 men have issues with fertilitybecause they are taking testosteroneright so their testosterone levelspresumably are going to be highendnormal or more but they are doingpresumably not testosterone replacementtherapy but they're doing what I calltestosterone augmentation therapymeaning they were somewhere in the 300to 900 nanograms per deciliterrange but decided to start takingtestosteroneanyway and then their their sperm countessentially diminishes to nil or closeto it in some cases yeah so I mean Ithink there's various reasons you wouldtake test I think you know some peoplehave been treated you know years ago

doesn't S very good okay justtestosterone therapy yeah okay but ifyou had you know for example we take 100of my infertile patients that come in toseei in clinic at least five of thosemen will be infertile because they're ontestosterone therapy and some of them doyou know have that suspicion they sayyou know I'm going to level with youthis is why my levels are probably lowbut a lot of men were not told that youknow when they started therapy so Ithink certainly for Reproductive age menthat's a very important conversation tohave um because there can be some otheryou know ways that we kind of maintainsperm production I think sperm crypreservation is a good option for thesemen as well um or there may be othertherapies they can think about justbecause of reproductive toxicity whatabout um HCG human chonic gatot Tropeand I hear about a lot of people who goon testosterone therapy who take HCGevery other day or so um typically thedosages that I hear about because peoplewrite to me about

don'ts um I'mgoing to assume that smoking cigarettesor vaping cigarettes is bad there anystudies that have looked specifically atvaping and sperm quality or testosteronelevels um and is there any evidence thatuh smoking cigarettes is good fortestosterone levels or sperm productionbecause I'm guessing the answer is no Ifeel like nowadays we just say don'tsmoke um but the data or the data whoknows maybe nicotine can help sperm Ihave no idea right uh it's possible Idon't think we have the data on that yetbut yeah I mean I think like to yourpoint I think lifestyle factors arecertainly a big one and you know some ofthese you know potentially um you knowkind of unhealthy habits so smoking iscertainly something you should not dothere have been you know lots of studiesthat do link that to you know lowerquality again all the different measuresthat we look at um also looking atfertility these men tend to have longertime to get pregnant um alcohol I thinkis another very common question getasked as well and I think for thatthere's you know I think less of astrong Association that we've seen sothere um you know there have been somestudies that show that very high levelsof alcohol and I guess that's sort ofsubjective what some would considerhigher or not but you know when you getabove maybe 20 drinks a week there havebeen some effects but usually a lot ofdrinking I would think that's a lot yeahbut some people don't but yeah I did anepisode on alcohol I think anything morethan two I know people are gonna um youknow bulk at this but you know I thinkany more than two drinks per week it'swhere you start to see some negativeeffects on some health parameters butyou know I'm I'm not a tea toddler soyou know yeah um but when you get tothis 20 drink that's when we started tosee some effects on Cen quality but theyou know the thing about that is thatusually if these men are drinking 20they're doing other things too smokingthere can be other drug use as well soit's hard to tease that out but ingeneral that's you know I thinkcertainly anything in moderation isprobably you know is probably better andso that's how I counsel patients I thinkagain it's very rare that I see men thatare at that level but I certainly letthem know when I do um there's some newdata coming out of that we've started towork on looking at if there aredifferent sensitivities to alcohol soyou know some East Asians have amutation that leads to Flushing um andso that may put those men at higher riskwhen they mix alcohol we may see someyou know slightly lower uh spermparameters you mean skin flushingbecause they don't make alcoholdehydrogenates is idea yeah um and is itI've heard about that in Asian culturesis there um an Asian population excuseme but is there any evidence that otherpopulations might have slight varianceon alcohol dehydr enas that perhapsmaybe they don't lack it Al together butthey have I don't know um they'rehypomorphs for whatever Gene makesalcohol dehydrogenase and therefore theydon't metabolize it as well andtherefore the toxic form of alcohol isactive in their system longer is thereany evidence for that no I think you'reexactly right I mean I think the onethat we think about is East Asiancultures where it can be you knowdepending on you know the region like umChinese Taiwanese probably about 40 to50% of population has you know mutationin the alh2 gene U but other populationsum in people of African ancestry there'sa rate of mutation I think not going toremember the exact percentage but Ithink a few percentage points is some umindividual with Hispanic ancestryashkanazi Jewish ancestry so in thisparticular Gene there's a mutation notthe same one that East Asians have butyou know again I think it gets to whymutation you know where we see sort ofnegative effects would persist and thehypothesis that you know Millennia agopo potentially it you know gave somesort of benefit for maybe an infectiousdisease or something similar to cysticfibrosis why you know again thismutation would persist in our populationif there's not you know you know somesort of Advantage uh to those carryingit um but we do see in other you knowother men as well so I think if you knowit's a simple question do you flush ifyou flush then maybe alcohol may haveyou know more of a a harm than thansomeone else and then you know get S ofgetting along the lines I think drug useis something that we should try and youknow we do counsel patients aboutbecause that can also negatively affectSE quality do you think it's fair to saythat okay moderation is best but ifsomebody had the option to either notdrink or drink in moderation that theyshould not drink would that be evenbetter is there any evidence for that Imean it seems like nowadays we take thestance that um not smoking at all isbetter than smoking a little bitactually when I was a postto at Stanfordfrom 200 five yes 2005 to uh end of 2010um you could still smoke on the Stanfordcampus I'm not a smoker but there wasthis collection of I have to be carefulwhat I say here there was a particulargroup on campus of postdocs and graduatestudents that would um you know thatwould colonize this little area outsidethe hospital and smoke because that'swhere you could smoke that waseventually um eliminated as apossibility you can't smoke on Sanfordcampus as far as I know but they wouldsmoke right outside the hospitalactually a lot of the hospital workerswould you know take a cigarette on theirbreak this is very common yeah and andthis was common all over the countryright this isn't unique to Stanford butnowadays you just don't see that umbecause it's not allowed um and we heardon't smoke it's terrible for XYZ andeverything every other letter of thealphabet with alcohol um we tend to hearthat if you're going to drink drink inmoderation um it's not clear exactlywhat number that is but is it possiblethat zero alcohol is better for spermand endocrine Health than any alcohol oris that not not a fair assumption I meanI think it's a good question I think youknow the your point about tobacco is anexcellent one because I think anysmoking is bad um but alcohol I think wedon't have that data for yet and so Ithink it's it's harder to it's harderfor me to make that recommendation topatients especially because you knowpeople do it for different reasons umand if it's not necessarily going tohelp them you know it'll harm them insocial situations or other things umyeah I usually just I usually give thethe moderation one unless again for thethe very high drinkers definitely talkabout that um you mentioned other druguse um I'm going to assume that uh"

pressure on the prostate ormaybe it was other other portions of theum maybe was the uh nerves running tothe penis itself um or surrounding areasmaybe it was pelvic floor related andsomehow you'll tell us I'm sure uh wasimpairing sexual function was itimpairing sexual function in any way byimpairing testosterone levels cuttingoff blood flow to the testes um and hereperhaps the most important thing to askstraight off is um is riding a bicyclebad for male reproductive health andSexual Health yeah these are greatquestions these again living in the BayArea working in the Bay Area uh cyclingis very very popular so these arequestions that I get a lot so I thinkyouknow I in general like we talked aboutbefore anything that's good for yourheart it's going to be good forfertility so good diet and exercisemaintain a good body weight and so Ialways try and encourage physicalfitness I think that's important but youknow it may be possible that someparticular um activities may put men atmore risk so I think cycling could beone of them if but it would sort ofdepend on exactly why we think that maybe a problem so I guess the theory isheat if you're in the saddle for a longtime you know these prolonged you knowrides that men take you know on weekendsyou know hours um that maybe if there'stoo much heat exposure that may be themechanism where sperm production woulddecline so there have been some studiessay maybe five hours a week would be youknow that may be too much so if you'reabove that level the sperm counts shownto be lower if you're less than thatthat may be okay so when I talk topatients about it I try and justencourage them to you know stand up inthe saddle to try and again sort of airthings out to try and dissipate heat ifif that's the mechan ISM we're going tothink regarding sexualdysfunction um that is thought to bepressure as you're alluding to so youknow the way that the saddle isconfigured ideally all the pressure isput on our iscal tuberosities or our sitbones that's what I'm sitting on now buton the saddle you know there's obviouslykind of the rigid nose and if there'stoo much pressure on that that actuallysqueezes between the iscal tuberositieswhere you know the main blood flow tothe penis goes and the main nerve Supplyis too and so if there's compression onthis you get this sort of lack of bloodflow or esea and you can get aneuropraxia as well if you crush thesenerves and so that over time can lead toproblems so you know some patients willsay that you know after I cycle you knowthings are numb down there for 30minutes um or a day or I don't geterections for that sort of same amountof time or sometimes you know men justsort of you know ride through it um andyou know hopefully things come back in aday or two so that's that could be themechanism and there are some Saddlesthat you know hopefully will be a littlesafer and you know I think that thissort of first was noted probably aroundthe 2000 or so and there is a bigredesign in terms of saddles to try andmake them a little bit more you knowanatomically correct to try and minimizesome of this and there's you know cyclefit that can be done or saddle fitrather that can be done at some of thecycling shops to try and you know lookat your body position look at your sizeand try and find a saddle that's saferum you know not this doesn't happen toeverybody I would say maybe if if youwere to um serve a cyclist maybe 20 to30% of men and women tend to besusceptible to this so I think if youare having discomfort in when you cyclewhether it be pain numbness or younotice dysfunction I think certainly youshould you know think about changingsaddles or think about changing writingstyle um there's other strategies aresometimes used but you know it'sabsolutely something that that everybodyshould be aware of I me to ask thisearlier but I seem to recall a studythat Drew a a correlation between umamount of walking and maybe it was spermquality but I think it was testosteronelevels maybe some other metrics of ummale sexual health forgive me I'm notrecalling the details now um is thereany evidence that walking more standingmore maybe even using a standing desk uhis beneficial for um you know pelvicfloor Health blood flow um prostatehealth it who knows could be any and allof those things in some way that isbeneficial for sperm qualitytestosterone level and or overall malesexual health yeah I think you know oneof the ways that we can characterizeactivity is Step count right I think Iknow I have a a watch that tells me thatit's something that I look at every dayand kind of strive for it and it turnsout that the more active you are uh it'sbeen shown sort of looking at you knowlarge National Data pools acrossdifferent age ranges that it isassociated with testosterone levels sobeing more active I think is veryimportant and that's another thing thatyou know everybody can do to try andimprove sort of testicular functionbroadly but testosterone specificallyand do you know whether or not that canbe separated out from the relationshipbetween being more active and less obeseI mean is this something that'sindependent of of obesity in other wordscan we incentivize people to walk moreum simply on the on the promise of umimproved Sexual Health well I don't knowSexual Health would be a different onebut we can I think there is aassociation between testosterone levelsand step count uh across different BMIstraight up so I think you know whetheryou're have the ideal body weightwhether you have a

not isseamen quality a proxy for overallvitality and health or is testosteronelevel appr proxy for overall vitalityand health um it sounds like seamenquality is the the metric that you keepcoming back

well Ithink you knowit's I think it's an excellent markerfor overall health I think there arestudies that support it can be a measureof how healthy you are you know if youlook at men with more health problemsthey can have lower seen quality butalso if you look at semen quality justby itself and then you look into thefuture how these men tend to do if theyhave higher semen quality um they tendto live longer need to go to the doctorless lower rates of cancer so I thinkthere's a lot of different ways thatseon quality may be a good barometer ofHealth um you know it's you know whythat link exists I think is not is notknown but there's lots of theories soone is that you know probably about 10%of the male genome is devoted toreproduction um and so it makes sensegiven that we only have about you know24,000 genes in the body that there's alot of um you know overlap so one genethat plays a role in reproduction mayplay a role in the cardiovascular systemor the neurological system and so if weget the first you know sort of sign thatreproduction is not perfect there may besome other health consequences down theline um another sort of hypothesis isthat again sort of going along this linethat reproduction is one of the firstthings that we see is that um you knowgestation is sort of very critical toour you know existence right andperturbations to that system haveprolonged um you know effects soort ofthe so-called sort of Developmentalorigin of adult disease or the Barkerhypothesis um and so we know that youknow pretty much sure children havehigher risk of cardiovascular disease orbeen studies to show that but we alsoknow that you know these gestationaleffects can also uh play out onreproductive function too so that alsomay be kind of a link you know sort ofearly seating of reproductive functionand then that's maybe the first markerthat we're going to have for otherhealth effects later on um there alsojust sort of sort of inherent um sort ofsimilarities between um reproduction andsome other sort of social effects so youknow know kind of one sort ofconfounding Factor when we're looking atsome of these studies I talked aboutlooking at mortality for example and semquality is that you know there's sort offactors that necessarily involvereproduction so your children and havinga partner and having a partner prolongslife um having kids prolong life eventhough it feels like kids are killingyou if you look at studies men with kidstend to live longer um so you knowthat's another possible explanation butI think you know really sort of thishealthum you know link between fertility Ithink is sort of a powerful one so I dothink it should be a barometer I thinkthat you know it should be sort of whenI've given lectures on this I call itthe six Vital sign I think it'ssomething that we should probably checkbecause if there is you know sort oflower levels that may tell us aboutsomething else going on you know whenwhen men come in for infertilityevaluations a lot of times we dodiagnose you know these new medicalproblems sometimes we diagnose canceryou know sort of alluding to some of thequestions you've as F diabetes and someother you know very significant geneticconditions as well and you know thefirst way that we would identify it isreproductive failure because their spermcounts are low um and other things so itis something I think that it's sort ofit's very important I think for peopleto realize um and it would be great Ithink you know another um I thinkadvantage to like the Centers forDisease Control for example to to starttracking it would it be a good idea forum males in their 20s and 30s to get"

time of umof conception um so I figured you knowwhy not freeze some sperm and it'srelatively inexpensive yeah yeah so Ithink paternal age is also you knowsomething that's increasing in thiscountry so over the last 40 years or sowe've seen that the average paternal agehas increased from about 27 and a halfto about 31 um and I should say thatthis is all fathers so um birthcertificate data or birth data iscollected a maternal level so you knowwhen a child is born somebody comes into collect data on the birth so they askyou know all the characteristics of themother and they also ask characteristicsof the father you know age educationobviously region of the country thechild was born um so we don't know youknow what number child that was for thefather we know it for the mother they doask you know is your first second theirEtc child um so the father unfortunatelywe just have data that sort of alllumped together um but over the lastagain 40 years we've seen that increaseinteresting over the last 40 years theyoungest father was 11 and the oldestwas 88 11 quite a span yeah88 goodness unrelated I I don't know Iassume I assume goodness it's anonymizeddata but ium 11 uh I have to ask thissorry to uh take us on a slight tangentbut what is the average age of ofpuberty in males in the United States umnow yeah so asking about I guess sort ofSparky when like sperm production beginsso um yeah there are a lot of markers ofof puberty secondary sexual charactersof beard growth deepening of voice ETthey happen at different rates anddifferent people but yeah thank you umat what point um are um yeah malesundergoing puberty yeah uh at at thelevel of of that we're talking abouthere yeah so it's yeah there has beendata we're going through puberty alittle bit earlier now than we used toum but it really varies so you know Ithink it's not um you know just liketestosterone ranges between like 300 and900 that's a wide range for anybody Ithink for most individuals you knowpuberty is you know probably 12 to kindof 15 16 in general so I just give sortof a very wide range when we're going tosay that's okay and you know some of thedata I'm basing it on is um when spermproduction begins in boys and it'sactually you know not that simple to bebe able to figure that out because youknow we don't generally talk to you knowyoung boys about how to masterbate howto collect and then check on that butthere's something called first morningvoided urine where we can actually lookat that and there have been some studiesdone and they see if there are sort ofyou know nocturnal emissions whetherthere're sperm in there and so generallyit probably starts around um theearliest would be kind of 11 12 13 butusually most is probably a little laterso maybe I'll refine that puberty andmove it a little bit later probably 14to 16 um is when probably about 70 80%of boys are going to have producedstarted producing sperm my understandingis that in females puberty is alsoshifting earlier perhaps at a moredramatic rate than appears to be thecase for males well I think there issome data for males too I think um butagain for your listeners I don't want toyou know have this onslaught of you knowpediatricians seeing kids that haven'tyou know and boys haven't gone throughpuberty by a certain age so I think it'sstill fairly widelet's get back to age of the father andissues likeautism um what are the data there um andthis to me is a practical issue becauseI think if there's one obvious takeawayfrom our discussion today it's that ummales should probably not wait untilthey're trying to conceive in order toassess their reproductive Health at thelevel of sperm quality um testosteronelevels perhaps perhaps but at leastsperm quality but um but perhaps menshould also be freezing their sperm ifin fact conceiving children after 40places their children at far greaterrisk for autism I mean my understandingis that the rates of autism aresomewhere between 1 and 80 you'll hearas high as one in 50 male birth but Ithink it's probably more like one in 60to 80 is that about right um and thatthe age of the father is a risk factoryeah I think that this gets into sort ofthe larger issue of you know how mensort of perceive fertility so you knowwe know that as women age fertilitydeclines uh but the oldest father everis 96 so the biologic potentialcertainly persists wait I want to knowhow long he lived to see how his childgrow up we he conceived at 96 amazsupposedly supposedly yeah well I'massuming he did not meet hisgrandchildren at least not thegrandchild of that child so wow how longdid he live um you know I well so thisthis is a man in India it's just rightup famous story but supposedly um he hada child he was had that child with himon uh like they're waiting at a bus stophe fell asleep the child was kidnappedthat led to divorce so yeah Dreadfulsort of a a horrible end but the wifewas also old not not that old but in her50s so yeah wow um tragic and andincredible story for separate reasons umokay I'll get my head around this 996year-old uh conceiving a child okayplease continue yeah uh so people Ithink or men think that the sort of theum you know their you know F fertileroad is sort of infinite um but I thinkthat's very much not the case so asyou're alluding to people have lookedinto risks for older fathers so you knowabout a hundred years ago was firstnoticed that dwarfism or condr plasiawas more common in last born children Soeventually that link was made um andsince then other conditions too sothere's like these neuros psychiatricconditions you're talking about likeautism is certainly one bipolarschizophrenia people have looked at andalso linked that with older age you knowLess attainment in school you knowfailing grades all that has been shownto be a little bit more common witholder fathers so you know why I thinkall these exist there can be sort ofdifferentexplanations um you know one explanationfor the autism Association I'll talkabout um you know some of this more gengentic or um of mutational reasons butone thing that some people say is thatyou know it could be sort of ahereditary trait and so it maybe thatyou know men that display some sort ofautistic characteristics you know maybethey take a little longer to meet apartner and so it sort of delayedchildbearing so maybe that's that's onepossible explanation but I think youknow there's been a lot of convincingevidence that there could be you knowreal epigenetic changes that occur withage and mutational changes that occurwith age um I think I read a statisticand you would know more being aneuroscientist that 84% of the the genesin our body are expressed somewhere inthe central nervous system is thatsounds about right yeah I don't want tostamp my name to that uh um but thatsounds about right so um it's it'sestimated that every year we generateabout two mutations in our um you knowsperm DNA so you can imagine that youknow a 40-year-old is going to have youknow 20 or TR 40 more mutations um thana 20-year-old so that rate does go upand if you're just randomly sprinklingmutations you know in you know a genomethat they're more likely to sort ofmanifest in you know maybe neurospsychiatric conditions um so there areyou know data convincing data that showsthat that does occur now again there'sbillions of base pairs in the body sothese random mutations likely most ofthem will will not result in anythingbut there can be some meaningful ones sofor example Le a condr plasia it's dueto a mutation in fiberblast growthfactor receptor um and what'sinteresting is that this condition isnot that rare right based on sort ofthese rare mutations you'd expect thiswould you know occur maybe about one in100 million but it turns out these theseconditions occur in about one in I think30 to 50,000 or so so there's sort ofthe discrepancy based on sort ofmutational rate that we expect based onage and the rate that we actually see sothe explanation for this is somethingcalled selfish spermatogonial selectionso what this suggests is that some ofthese mutations that occur randomlyoccur in proliferation Pathways and soit gives the sperm that contain thesesort of advantages over their you knowbrothers and sisters that don't havethem for example and so then they outcompete the other sperm and so they'remore likely to lead to a child ratherthan sort of a random smattering you canactually see that some of thesemutations are more common in older menthan younger men if you look you screenfor some of these mutations in you knowsome of these Pathways umagain the longer that we're exposed tolife there's just more likely to be youknow different chemical exposures otherexposures and so people have looked atepigenetic signatures sort of thesesignatures that um you know that dictatewhich genes are going to be expressedand which aren't and there are differentpatterns between older and youngerfathers and you know why what triggeringthose is not known but there aredifferences so those could alsopotentially explain you know some ofthese risks that we see um you know itused to be that people thought that youknow if you're an older father maybethere's a lot of advantages you you knowfor the kids right because if you'reyou're more resourced right I alwaystell patients that you know when theycome to see me for like erectionproblems or anything I always saynothing gets better with age right andthat's mostly true although theyvepointed out that um salary often goes upwith age and wisdom goes up with age soyou would imagine if you're moreresourced maybe the kids are going toalso have an advantage to that but youknow again there's a lot of convincingdata that that's that's probably not thecase um there's even there's one studythat I saw that showed that if you lookat MRIs uh of brains of children justafter birth they're actually a littlesmaller for older fathers compared toyounger fathers so um I think there aresome you know sort of talking about kindof neurocognitive development um some ofthose effects and there's also been umstudies looking at cancer risk too sohigher risk of breast cancer prostatecancer and adult children higher risk ofyou know leukemia or CNS Cancers andchildren as well so I think the more welook the more we find out of theseassociations with paternal age um so Ithink it's some you certainly be awareof I think you talking about mitigationstrategies I think sort of Educationwould be important for you know couplesto try earlier you individuals to tryearlier to conceive you know if we thinkit's a mutational reason I think um youknow certainly freezing sperm I think isa is a good option aswell my understanding is that umanalysis of DNA fragmentation in spermdidn't does not allow for selection ofthe best sperm on the basis of uh DNAcomposition um translated to Englishwhat I mean is in order to tell whetheror not this the DNA are mutated in asperm you have to kill the spermbasically so um and since um in a givenpool of sperm so to speak um there willbe forward motile non-motile twitcherstwitching in place dead sperm um somepercentage of dead sperm or immotilesperm is presumably normal some smallpercentage hopefully um and that somemight have some DNA fragmentation somemight not so um is the way to addressthis um averages what I'm hearing hereis that if you haven't already had kidsor if you want more kids um that youmight want to know about your spermquality I would say you do um and thatif you can afford it you might want totake a look at DNA fragmentation data umbut having done this um what onereceives is a chart that goes from Redbad to Green good and then they put thearrow hopefully in the green zone andthen you say oh good you know I'm in thegreen zone I don't have fragmented DNAin my sperm but really that's anaveraging of all the sperm right itcould be that as you age that somepercentage of those sperm havefragmented DNA and um if one of those isthe one that successfully um wins theegg so to speak um fertilizes the eggthen that fragmented DNA containingsperm is going to propagate that intoyour offspring so are there anytechnologies that can allow men to umselect or for or improve the DNA oftheir sperm not just the motility I meyeah I wish right that's sort of theHoly Grail because I think he pointedout sort of a variant of right theHeisenberg uncertainty principle is thatwe can't if we identify which sperm isbad we're necessarily going to destroyit so to tell you know which one isharboring these mutations um would begreat but I think we're not there yet Imean one thing that we do do is washsperm so we do sort of Select the mostmodal sperm we clear out the dead onesum and I think embas are pretty good attelling which sperm they think arebetter but you again we don't have anyreal objective data to try andunderstand you know which are harboringsomething or other but I think if weunderstood more about this link with ageor again other conditions um hopefullywe'll be able to stop some of this passthrough let's get back to the prostateum this incredible

erections it's involvedin a number of things if you could giveus a you know catalog of things that theprostate does um I you spent a lot oftime thinking about this gland what aresome of the cooler things that it thatit does that we don't know about um youknow how do we keep it healthy uh andwhat are the consequences of not keepingit healthy yeah so the prostate is agland about the size of a walnut it sitsbehind the bladder and it's involved inreproduction it produces some of theproteins enzymes that are necessary foryou know sperm to be supported and youknow the ejacalate to kind of keep thethe sperm healthy um in the femalereproductive tract so you know itfunctions in reproduction and thenbasically after reproduction is done itdoesn't really serve any useful functionso then it just becomes a problemessentially so the urethra which iswhere we pee through so it connects thebladder you know to exits the body umruns right through the prostate and aswe age the prostate does get biggerthat's sort of a known thing and as theprostate gets bigger it creates sort ofmore resistance in this pipe and so itmakes the bladder have to work harderand that leads to a lot of the symptomsyou know that we've been talking aboutalready you know waking up at night weakstream this need to uh urinate urgentlyum sometimes feeling like you're notemptying all the way so it's sort of aconsequence of the prostate um sort ofbeing there uh in terms of ways that youcan keep the prostate healthy I thinkthat there's really nothing that youknow necessarily can do I think that youknow one thing I talk to patients aboutwhen these sort of symptoms start is toknow some of the triggers so um you knowlike you mentioned drinking a lot beforeyou go to bed so if you don't want towake up at night that's not a goodpractice you know may even want to gointo bed sort of a little dehydratedjust so you can try and last the nightum there are some you know particulardrinks or foods that tend to be moreirritating so like spicy foods acidicFoods those can sometimes irritate thelining of the bladder and make you haveto pee a little bit more you knowcaffeine is a diuretic uh so it makes usurinate more and it also um uh can alsoirritate the bladder and give you thatsensation alcohol will do the same thingso I think you know kind of knowing someof those triggers May kind of saave offsome of the symptoms a little bit butyou know again if you enjoy those vicesand you're willing to tolerate it that'sokay too I'm hearing more and more abouta practice of people taking low dose todofil seis um low dose meaning in theneighborhood of 2.5 to 5 milligrams perday um not necessarily for erectiledysfunction but for prostate health andwas um somewhat surprised to learn thatthose drugs were actually developedfirst for treatment of prostate healthto increase blood flow to the prostateum is that true and um is there goodreason to um think about taking 2.5 to 5milligrams of tadalfil per day simplyfor maintaining blood flow to theprostate and thereby maintaining orimproving prostate health I meancertainly it can do that it candefinitely help with some of theseurinary symptoms that we've been talkingabout you know looking at Placebocontrol trial sort of our highest levelof evidence does show that you know lowdose of tadalfil these two and a half to5 milligram these daily dosing um canhelp with these urinary symptoms so Ithink that not necessarily it's apreventative measure but for men thatare bothered you know otherwise I thinkmost men probably wouldn't want to takea pill every day but certainly if youhave some of these symptoms it candefinitely help with urinary bother andthen the added benefit is you alsoalluded to is it can help with therectile function as well even at the 2.5to 5 milligram dosage interesting umyeah my experience is that there are alot of people who would love to takepills every day um there seems to be akind of binary distribution where um andhere I'm just thinking about the malalethat I hear from because I hear from ofcourse males and females but um I get alot of questions about what can I takewhat can I take what can I take um anduh but as you point out there's also acategory of of of men who seem to um notwant to take anything not want tomeasure anything not want to takeanything but especially not takeanything and then there's the othergroup um and the other group somewhatsurprisingly seemed to be the L theyounger excuse me population um whomaybe grew up in the YouTube era ormaybe in the era where Sexual Health wasdiscussed more openly than it wascertainly when I was in college I meanthe extent of sexual health discussionsin my high school and I went to a verygood high school where um it only takesone sperm which as you pointed out istrue for IV F but more is better ifyou're trying to conceive naturally umand um there were discussions aboutcommunication and consent obviouslysuper important um and then um they justkind of turned us loose uh to learn fromour friends and other sources I meanthat and family sometimes had thediscussion sometimes didn't um uhdifferent families different discussionsobviously um so very very littleinformation nowadays I think there's alot more discussion about these thingsand so the 20 to 40y old male crowdseems to be the crowd that are askingyeah what can I take these are also thepeople who are getting on testosteronetherapy early perhaps without the need Ijust want to flag that because um I Ithink uh if I understand correctly umyou're seeing a lot of testosteronetherapy that perhaps people don't needis that right well I think it's a mixsome people probably do need it but Ithink that you know before starting iteverybody should be aware of all therisks and you've kind of highlightedsome but testosterone any any medicationright is going to have some risks and soeverybody needs to be aware of whatthose are and for testosteronereproduction is certainly one of themand if they're not already doing all theother things getting adequate sleeplimiting their alcohol intakes notsmoking getting exercise Etc seems thattestosterone therapy would not be theprimary entry point like first work outall the right all the basics I thinkthat's the big difference I thinknowadays the what should I take questioncomes up early when people aren'tnecessarily doing all the other thingsum that they could do to promote theirhealth anyway this is observational onmy part um you're the one whose's Clinicthey're showing up uh too um have aquestion about"

can dieimage the whole apparatus is that rightthat's true without having to cutanything is right is that worth peopledoing or is that only under conditionswhere people are experiencing some someum some vexing issue yeah I think thatsome of those tests should only be doneif there's a problem but I think a maleurinary tract infection is rare enoughenough that it should be evaluated sowomen have very short urethras but menhave a very long urethra right it has togo through the entire penile urethra theprostatic urethra up into the bladderand so the way a urinary tract infectionwould happen you know one way would bethat a bacteria actually gets all theway you know back and that's just a muchlonger Trek um and so if something rarelike that does happen we look foranatomic causes for that so there can bedifferent scar tissue in the uretha forexample there can be stones in thebladder there can be stones in thekidney sometimes men AR emptying theirbladders all the way so those those menshould be evaluated because there can besome pathology that we could hopefullyidentifyincorrect let's talk about erectiledysfunction um I put out the call forquestions in anticipation of thisepisode and um no surprise um at least30% of the questions from males wereabout erectile dysfunction um or uhquestions about what's normal in termsof libido level kind of interestingright you know and we'll deal with thefirst question first but um what are themost common causes erectile dysfunctionare they hormonal in nature I thinkthat's a a common belief that if peopleare experiencing erectile dysfunctionthat it's because their testosteronelevels are too low hence all theinterest in um testosterone therapy umor are there other say blood flowrelated pelvic flow related neural umbrain to umto body neural connections that areresponsible I'm guessing it's all ofthese things how do we parse this um andyeah what tell us about erectiledysfunction what you most commonly seewhat you most commonly do in order totreat it yeah so you know erectiledysfunction is you know sort of theinability to consistently achieve andmaintain an erection and it's fairlycommon um you know of all the conditionsI see that's definitely the number oneso you know if you look at men over theage of 40 over half will have sometrouble with erections under age of 40is probably about 15 to 20% so this is avery common condition that we see interms of the ideology it can vary alittle bit you know we used to thinkthat they were primarily psychogenic umbut that was you know years that wasdecades ago now we know that most ofthem are organic so it's actually ablood flow issue so the most commonconditions just sort of nationally wouldbe the same things that cause blood flowproblems anywhere in the body so highblood pressure diabetes you knowatherosclerosis anything that sort ofcan impair blood getting you know to theend organ um and sometimes you knowthere has been data that you knowtrouble with erections can actuallypredate other more you know serious youknow vascular conditions so the bloodvessels in the penis the penal arteriesare about 1 millimeter you know and theheart and the Brain they're much largerso you know it's much easier to olude asmall vessel than a large vessel sothat's why there have been some studiesto support that it's sort of an earlymarker for vascular disease um so Ithink looking at those risk factors youknow sort of Lifestyle obesity again isanother is a common one um endocrinedisorders actually fairly small it'sprobably less than 10% probably around5% or so um pelvic cancer treatment isanother very common one after you knowtreatment for prostate cancer whether itbe radiotherapy or surgical therapybladder cancer um sometimes rectal colorrectal cancer that treatment alsoanytime that we're you know um involvingsome of the nerves and the the vascularand the pelvis that can also impact uherectile function as well what abouthernia hernia that should be separate sosometimes if there you know I always saythat in medicine you can never say neverum but you know generally if that wasgoing to manifest as erectile functionwould probably be due to maybe some painsyndroms which can rarely happen duringjust the early post-operative period butthe blood supply the nervous Supply isseparate so you said something veryimportant for people to hear so I'mgoing to highlight it um you said thatless than 10% of erectile dysfunction isdue to a hormonal issue um I don't knowhow much time you're spending on YouTubeand the internet but um that is going tobe a shocker for a lot of males outthere because so much of the discussionaround testosterone is around libido andsexual function so um it's key forpeople to hear that it's also key forthem to know about this other90% um when you say blood issue thenwhat is the common first pass for"

average you know when we're lookingat men in their kind of 30s and Beyondyou know sometimes it can be a few moretimes a week than that but you know ifthey're having sex every day or veryoften then

about some of theside effects they may have but thoseprobably help 60 to 70% of men um andthey work well you know in terms ofanother common question is how do wedecide which one we're going to startsometimes insurance will tell us whichone we're going to do um that's a commonone you know all these medications tendto be somewhat similar one differencetends to be the time of onset you knowhow quickly they reach Peak levels inthe body and then also how quicklythey're cleared from the body sotadalfil is somewhat different and thenit lasts longer the half full life isabout 20 hours or so so it's sort ofmarketed as a weekend pill so somepeople like the idea of that you knowtaking a pill on Friday so having someleft on Saturday um but for others youknow we start with with one of the otherones the fact that these drugs like toDil uh also called Calis right is Calisthe brand name right okay and um Viagrais that a brand name right stands for umwhat is the generic name oh sofil s okayum so so because they are effective insuch a large percentage of cases whatdoes that say about the vascular systemof all these males that are um havingerectile dysfunction but then it'sgetting resolved by these drugtreatments is that in other wordssomebody comes into your clinic they'rehaving this issue you prescribe um oneof these drugs they come back and sayeverything's working great or maybe theydon't come back they just you know sendan email say everything's great um butdo you need to have a discussion withthat person about their over overallvascular health because a few minutesago you told us that the fact that theyweren't getting erections due to whatnow appears to be a vascular issue umcan be resolved for the penile tissuebut um is it going to solve their othervascular issues or should those peoplebe on the lookout for cerebrovascularcardiovascular disease that canpotentially cause things at least as badas erectile dysfunction and may be worseyeah absolutely well I think they shouldbe screened so you know sometimes I'mdiagnosing in the first doctor thatthey're seeing in a long long time umbut otherwise I do encourage them to seea primary care doctor to be screened foryou know blood pressure lipid levels youknow fasting U blood glucose all thosethings again sort of for early markersof some of these sometimes they'reidentified sometimes not but I thinkit's you know I think we kind of talkedabout sort of the ideal patient that'sperfect body weight nothing else isgoing on but that's as you know a veryrare entity so usually there's somethingthat can be done to be optimized and Idon't I try not to be alarmist aboutthis but I do want to you know encouragemen to sort of take ownership of thehealth cu sometimes can improve um youknow some of these conditions but againwe have terrific medications for for menin whom we cannot what are the commonside effects of these drugs so they'rebaso dilator they open up blood vesselsso we get some offt Target effects soheadache facial flushing back eggs legcramps indigestion nasal congestionthose would be the most common beforethe last Super Bowl there was some pressabout the fact that a lot of the playerswere taking these drugs at low dosagesbefore the game presumably to increaseblood flow of their muscles and brain isthat is that what the rationale was Ithink so yeah you know another is wetalked about sort of how cycling maylead to erectile problems or sexualproblems there has been some datalooking at taking like biago or one ofthese medications the AL to alil beforea ride again to try and increasecirculation to decrease the chance ofany of the negative effects of prolongedsaddle pressure so it sounds like justincreasing blood flow and lowering bloodpressure slightly is just a good thingall around yeah I think there'scertainly a benefit yeah because thesemedications were originally I think asyou're alluding to were developed as ablood pressure treatment and this wassort of an amazing of Target effect thathas turned into a billion dollindustry so you mentioned about 10% orless of erectile dysfunction is due to"

delil umEtc um what about the remainingpercentage and are there othertreatments that um you you prescribed oror given um in which cases do you needto uh resort to um I guess more invasiveapproaches yeah so another therapy wehave is urethal suppository so you canactually put a medication in the tip ofthe penis it's then absorbed by the restof the penis Al inject suppositorysuppository or a gel or a jelly yeah umso it's also a basad sort of the conceptis very similar um sometimes that youknow is is okay for men and theytolerate it it's uh safe for partners aswell um it can tingle a little bit so wedefinitely let men know because um oneof the main medications does cause likea little bit of a a burn as well whywould somebody do this as opposed totaking the pill form of the drugs wewere just talking about mostly efficacywould be a big one um and so this thisthis can sometimes help where otherscannot so that's one uh penileinjections are another common therapy sothe efficacy of penile injections areprobably 80 to 90% uh again we'reinjecting basa dilators into the penisso the idea just opens up blood vesselseasier to get and to keep erections youcan imagine there's a huge psychologicalbarrier to putting an needle in yourpenis is this something that thepatients are doing for themselves athome or that you're doing is it longlasting is that something you do at theclinic and then they come back every fewweeks or so no yeah this is an onddemand treatment so we we teach them howto do it the first time I do it with usin clinic ideally we try and get anerection that lasts probably 20 to 30minutes so we usually start at a lowdose and then they just increase at homeuntil they get you know an erection thatlasts for that amount of time is itinjected subcutaneous or actually intotheum goodness the meteor tissue of of thepenis that's right into the erectilebodies directly yeah and they you onlyhave to inject one side they docommunicate with eachother most men say it's fine it's asmall it's a very small gauge needleabout as big as you know a few strainsof here like I have an appointment overin Opthalmology and I've seen injectionsinto the human eyeball and it isincredible how fast and how painlessthat procedure is when it's done by theright person nobody should try that athome on their own but when it's done bya skilled opthalmologist it's juststriking you know you hear you thinkabout needle in the eye you know what'sworse it's like the childhood rhymeright stick a needle in my eye likecan't think of anything worse but ummaybe you know an injection in the penissounds almost as bad but you're tellingme that if patients are prescribed thisthat they can do this with with limitedif any discomfort well it does have ahigh dropout rate surprise surprise umyeah I think no one's excited about ityou know it's I guess the mood cansometimes be affected but a lot ofcouples are very comfortable with itagain it's very efficacious the part theman can do it his partner can do it umso it does workwell and I I guess here we're sort ofascending the the list of uminvasiveness right um what what is atthe the sort of top tier of invasivfor for retile dysfunction so then we gointo penile implants so there's actuallya surgical procedure we can do to put adevice inside the penis that can helpmen be hard when they want to and thatcomes in sort of two main forms there'seither non-inflatable or inflatable sothe non-inflatable sort of a bendable umit's you know has sort of a metal coreand so when men don't want to have sexthey bend it down when they're ready forsex they can kind of bend it up it'sreally just they on demand yes H yeahinteresting yeah so it's simple to useum sort of the more I guess kind of umsort of natural form would be theinflatable so when you're not using itit's deflated and then when you're readyto use it it's inflated and you inflateit with basically a pump that's in thescrotum so all this is sort ofsurgically implanted inside a man allunder the skin you know unless you knowwhat you're looking for it'd be verydifficult to tell if a man has it ordoesn't have it but when he's ready hepumps it up and it moves fluid from areservoir some you which usually is alsoit's also surgically implanted into thepenis to get a rigiderection what is the relationshipbetween psychological arousal anderection as it relates to theseTechnologies I mean the way you'redescribing it sounds purely mechanicalright um we're talking about nocturnalerections which I suppose people couldbe having erotic dreams but I don'tthink that's a a prerequisite fornocturnal erections at all right so umis the idea that if adequate blood flowis achieved then any signal from thebrain can initi create a Cascade ofblood flow that creates the erection oris it the case with some of thesetreatments that um sounds like bloodflow is almost um autonomous right wellI think a lot of these um yeah the bloodflow is not adequate and that's whywe're having to you know sort of gobeyond but generally as you point outthere's different stimulation whether itbe you know visual tactile or factory umthat sort of starts that Cascade thatreleases neurotransmitters in the penisthat leads to this phase of dilation youknow natur and men get erections a fewyears ago I was reading about umvasopress inhalence you know there was abunch of stuff hitting the market um bythe way I don't suggest that people umget experimental with this stuff youknow as a neuroscientist who also umknows the thing about neuropeptides andneuro hormones that can impact thehypothalamus you know I just I I justcover my eyes and kind of um cringe whenI think about people inhalingvasopressin thinking oh yeah you knowthere's a study that vasopressinincreases sexual desire or somethinglike that um but nowadays I'm reading alot more about a really interestingpeptide um treatment which I think is aFDA approved prescription drug which isum relates to uh a um melanocytestimulating hormone that comes out ofthe medial pituitary um that is used toincrease sexual desire it's prescribedfor women um but men are starting totake it um and it seems to have at leastfrom what you read on the internet um apretty profound impact on libbido and onerectile frequency and persistence um isthis something that you know it's you'reusing in your clinic um uh yeah whatabout these peptides that people areinhaling and injecting and some of themare taken in oral form but most often Ithink it's nasal inhalent or um uh orit's uh a subcutaneousinjection yeah so um those are not onesthat that we use in clinic but I thinkyou know looking at sort of just sexualdysfunction broadly there are a lot ofthings that you know we do try and helpum and one of the things sort of that Ikind of relates to that that is it'sbeen a proposed treatment for it is thisconcept of delayed orgasm or delayedejaculation so I think everybody'sfamiliar with premature ejaculationright where men ejaculate too quickly umbut on the other end of the spectrumthere's men that takes you know a longtime to ejaculate and you know what thatis is sort of defined differently butgenerally most people would say likesort of two standard deviations aboveaverage so on average probably around 5minutes or so two standard deviationswould be kind of 20 to 25 minutes so formen that take that long to ejaculatethat would be considered delayed orsometimes they don't ejaculate everytime that they you know have relationsso for those I think there is a need fortreatment because there's no FDA proovtherapy for that um and so that's why Ithink you know providers are trying someof these other you know moreexperimental things um there's some thatwe use just not that one in particularum there's also some device that havebeen trial as well but it's it's achallenge because you know I certainlyyou really feel for these men um it'sone of the pleasures in life um and someof them are never able to have sex oronly or sorry never able to orgasm andsome are only able to do it very rarelyso we do want to offer thembenefit what about pelvic floor Healthmore generally um the topic of pelvic"

turns outKeel Kagel was a person um who named theexercise after himself um whether or nothe did them or not I do not know but ummy understanding is that Kagel are apelvic floor strengthening exercise umand my understanding is that some peopleexperience urinary or sexual dysfunctionbecause of a overly relaxed AKA weakpelvic floor but that some people havethe exact same problems because of ahypercontracted AKA overly tense tightstrong pelvic floor meaning don't runout and start doing kull just becauseyou heard about them they're not goodfor everybody they might be bad forcertain people but what about pelvicfloor health I mean should men be payingattention to pelvic floor Health shouldmen be doing pelvic floor exercises Imean I think it's really key that yousay that because you know not everythingyou hear about is good and I think it'snot good for the right person so sothere are certainly men that I see thathave very you know just a lot of tensiona lot of anxiety sometimes these men youknow urinate every hour I mean there'sother things and you can just tellthey're just sort of very wound up and Ithink for that man you know one of theissues you kind of allude to is heprobably needs to relax more so you knowpelvic floor Physical Therapy can stillbenefit you because there are some justdifferent feedback exercises that couldbe done to help with relaxation so youknow any eurologist office there'susually a list a lot of differentproviders around the region that canhelp with some of these um Keeleexercises though can be useful you knowfor example for um like prostate cancerRehabilitation some of these men wherewe're trying to kind of rebuild some ofthe strength or maintain or improvecontinence in these men we do want tostrengthen some of these muscles so thatthey can sort of recreate or replacewhat was lost when the prostate wasremoved so I think for the right manthey can be useful but yeah it could bea dangerous tool in the wrong hands andyou mentioned that if people want tolearn more about pelvic floor therapy umthey can contact their local urologistand find a good pelvic floor good malepelvic floor specialist do they tend tospecialize male female they're usuallyuh pretty much gender or sex agnostic sothey usually are able to help all and umforgive me for uh asking for an AbridgedAnatomy lesson here but um could youdescribe the pelvic floor muscles andhow they relate to the bladder prostateurethras anatomy that you talked aboutbefore because I have the picture of thebladder urethra prostate penis in mybrain um I know um by uh life experiencewhere the testes and scrotom arerelative to all of that but now I'mtrying to figure out um how like so thepelvic floor a bunch of muscles thatthat are attached to the pelvis but howdo they interact with those uh withthose organs yeah good question so theysit beneath you know the sort of in theperineum so the area between the scrotumand the anus and Beyond too so theybasically support all the structuresthere they support you know the base ofthe penis the prostate the bladder therectum uh and you know they're they kindof keep M you know adequate tension tokeep all those structures up they relaxwhen you know different functions arenecessary they're very important forejaculation um you know some peoplethink that they kind of trigger some ofthe orgasmic response as well um youknow sometimes men will have you knowpain in that area in the perinal areacan transmit to other parts of the bodylike the scrotum you know one of the onecause of scrotal pain and there can bemany can sometimes be pelvic floordysfunction so I think you know again Ppelvic floor therapy can be useful forsort of a constellation of symptomsagainst some urinary symptoms as well soI think for some patients it can behelpful but um you know again there ifif you get things too tense um that cansometimes be harmful so presumably thesepelvic floor therapists also help peopleachieve a more relaxed pelvic floor ifthat's what they need exactly got itgoing to some of the questions that umcame back to me when I solicited forquestions in anticipation of thisepisode um several not a few um let'ssay a couple dozen people asked aboutsplit urine stream is that a signatureof prostate overgrowth is that a aurethal issue is it perfectly normal umI'm assuming here they mean a splitstream of urine that doesn't unify atany point they're talking about aconsistently split urine stream and forthose of you that don't know what I'mtalking about we're talking about aurine stream that's actually two urinestreams and we're assuming one urethralopening because I hit the literature onthis and um there is a case of offailure to fully fuse the urethral ductduring development where peoplesome I'm assuming small fraction ofmales have a ureth opening on the baseof the penis and at the tip of the penislet's rule that out as a a possibilityfor now um but now that it's on thetable what percentage of males have thatuh twoe reill openings so wellhypospadius what you're describing wherethe the actual meatus is not at the tipbut it's kind of along the proximalurethra or you know even further downsometimes in the scrotum probably about1% of bursts um and usually it'srecognized at Birth and oftentimes it'ssurgically corrected because it's betterto repair it early rather than laterokay so ruling that out um what is thecause of split urine stream and is it uma signature of a largeryou know one of the reasons that we youknow urin a sort of um from anevolutionary standpoint right is to youknow basically deposit in sort of aconvenient time our waste and we don'twant to get it everywhere because wedon't want to sort of label ourselves umwith smell of urine because that'll beeasier for predators to to be able toidentify so just similar to today we'dlike everything to get in the toiletwithout creating a mess so anytimethere's turbulent flow um it itcertainly could signal an issue so itcould be like your re issues arepointing out a prostatic issueinadequate speed you know of getting theurine out the meatus so you definitelyshould see you know a physici to getevaluated because there's likely someissue that could beimproved the most popular question Ireceived from males however was about"

            "text": "perhaps nosurprise penislength you're an expert in this actuallyum not just because you're a urologistmale reproductive health expert but umyou published a study recently on thechanging Trends in penile length um tellus about that study I have so manyquestions about um the methodologybecause um I have to assume this didn'tinvolve self-report right those wereexcluded yeah yeah so um lying wasexcluded um being fous here but um yeahhow was this study done I mean prettyincredible stud study umand the results are I don't know ifthey're surprising or not I I first Ithought oh this is surprising but theresults were only surprising in light ofwhat you were talking about earlierabout sperm and testosterone levels Ithink um I'll let you describe the studynow rather than than giving people thepunch line here yeah so I mean theorigin was that we were looking at wewanted to know average lengths foranother project that we were doing andyou know going down the rabbit hole thishas been reported for decades you knowthere's different reasons that peoplehave reported P length you knowsometimes they do it uh just onvolunteers again to sort of get theaverage lengths of different populationssometimes it's done pre and pr-surgically to try and understand whatchanges would occur um so we just sortof called the literature found data on55,000 men all over the world um andwanted to see if there was a you knowsort of a Time pattern with that andsimilar to your hypothesis we assumebased on all the other data that wewould likely see a decline you knowwhether it be you know chemicalenvironmental exposure but if nothingelse if we're getting bigger you knowthe functional penal length shoulddecline because you know the super pubicfat pad will get a little bit bigger andso we'll kind of lose penal length withthat and so much to our surprise thesuper pric F pad excuse me um being thepad of fat directly over the penis rightright and so you know if that getsbigger that'll necessarily compromisepenile length but you know as youalluded to we found is actually theopposite that um the penises weregetting getting longer with time so howit's measured measured differently soone of our inclusion criteria was thatall the studies had have measured sortof in an office sort of in a clinicalsetting so whether it be a you know aclinician or whether it be a researcherthat actually did it so there'sdifferent ways you can measure a penisyou can just do a stretch length so youkind of stretch it up as much as you canand then use sort of a ruler to measurehow long it is again from as deep as youcan get you know the pubic bone ideallyup to the tip of the the glands or theokay guys so here's what he's describinghe's talking about measuring from thetop not from the bottomBelieve It or Not people ask questionsabout this um my daughter made that jokeactually oh yeah yeah yeah uh measuringfrom the top not from the bottom nocheating um you're talking aboutstretching the penis while it's flaccidpresumably and then measuring fromessentially contact with the a locationthat's contact with the pubic bone tothe the tip right okay so that thatlength was recorded in 50,000 men mhmwow yeah so that was one and then wealso looked at a w length and so there'sdifferent ways that an erection can beachieved sort of in a clinical settingso one is you can ask a man to stimulatehimself and then measure so that wassome of the studies and then the othermethod as we've alluded to earlier isyou can inject a man with a medicine togive him an erection and then measure itand did 50,000 men participate in thataspect of the study it was less no thatwas I think that was about probably 10to 15, men I have to wondering whetheror not it's easy or difficult for peopleto recruit subjects for these studies Idon't know I could see it going in bothways yeah some of the studies actuallyhad a tremendous number had about umlike 15,000 men some individual studiescontributed that and actuallyinterestingly after we published itthere were some men that volunteered uhfor the next study to be measured I'msure you'll hear from some of them afterthis episode um what was the majorfinding so the major finding we wantedto do is just give normative data wefound that it varied around the world Sobased on different regions um theaverage lengths you know varied a littlebit but generally on average um erectpenis is probably between about 5 to 6Ines somewhere in that neighborhood sothat was kind of the take-home we wantthat was the average the average forwlink did you publish the fulldistributions uh we didn't I think wewere we're we're our plan was actuallyto make a follow- on study so we couldshow everybody you know I guess probablythey were interested where they kind offell on the graph but it was fairly youknow it was normally distributed yeah Iwould think that um despite the um youknow the wide availability ofpornography that um um that thedistributions like the Scatter Plots ofall the data uh would be interesting tomen um for the same reason that thetestosterone by function of age datapublished as a scatter plot in thattextbook I referred to earlier rightwere interesting because um the scatterplot distributions I feel like um pointto um other takeaways that one can be intheir 70s and have testosterone levelsequivalent to a male and healthy male inhis 30s that one can be in their 30s andhave testosterone levels that are twiceas much or half as much as as AG matchcohort this kind of thing um I thinkthere there's value in that so um whatwhat other takeaways um uh arrived withthe data from the the penis length studythat perhaps we didn't we didn't hearabout like what what did you find mostinteresting about about the data wellthat there was any change over time youknow this was a fairly short uh study itwas probably about you know 30 years orso um but we did find that penal lengthhas been increasing over time so um youknow that was just sort of fascinatingthat we would see sort of in such ashort interval of time that there wouldbe a change number one but that we we'dsee a lengthening number two so you knowagain similar to the concerns that arosefor these you know relatively shortperiod of time where you would seechanges in semen quality um you know itsuggests something sinister right it'sunlikely to be a genetic change becausethat would take you know centuriesprobably uh certainly severalGenerations so fact that this happenedso quickly um was justsurprising um this brings to mind someof work that I was involved in years agoum when I was a master student I studiedum early organizing effects of hormoneson uh the brain and body and um I'm surethis has been updated um since then butum my recollection is that uh duringembryonic development males um areexposed to a certain amount of Di hydrtestosterone not testosterone butdihydrotestosterone which organizes thebrain male as they used to say now thethe verbiage around that would probablybe a little bit different but the ideais that um males are born um with peniletissue of course but then it's duringpuberty that the same hormonedihydrotestosterone then exerts anactivating effects on the genitals andthe genitals grow during puberty penislength increases so assuming that thestudy that you did was on males um postpuberty right I'm assuming it was umthen it would imply that something'schanging about the levels or thesignaling related todihydrotestosterone um how could thathappen um do we have any ideas aboutwhat might be happening I mean this isthe opposite of environmental endocrinedisruptors preventing sperm from beingas you know high quality and numerous asthey could be or from you know orEnvironmental factors either in utero orpost utero um suppressing testosteronelevels here we're talking about theopposite effect we're talking aboutdihydro testosterone levels presumablybeing higher in males over the last 30years and thereby longer penises rightso I mean I think there's differentconjectures that you could make aboutwhy this could happen I mean it could beyou know maybe endocrine disruptingchemicals you know in utero some earlyexposure you know that some of themothers had to kind of androgeniceffects during the male programmingwindow that may have led to some longerlengths um another hypothesis we had isthat if if males are going throughpuberty earlier the earlier one goesthrough puberty the longer length tendsto be so maybe that provides sort ofthis link so earlier puberty tends to belonger potentially means longer durationexposure todihydrotestosterone longer penises rightyeah you may be surprised to not to knowyou might not be surprised to know thatthere is a uh subculture online I knowbecause they contacted me inanticipation of this episode um of umpost puberal males who take acombination ofdihydrotestosterone and low levels ofgrowth hormone in efforts to try andincrease their penile length and the theum ones taking dihydrotestosteronethey're not taking pure dhg they'retaking things likeoxandrolone um which very closely mimicsthe structure of DHT um they report umsome success um fortunately they did notsend me pictures um otherwise I wouldhave just forwarded them to you for yournext study um but this stuff ishappening um in post puberal Mal so umit it all rests on this dihydrotestosterone hypothesis um I don't knowjust a point of Interest yeah I don'tknow it just physiologically it doesn'tmake sense why that would work as you'repointing out post pubertally and thenunless they're doing other things youknow some sort of stretching exercisesor call jelking but yeah I would notrecommend that thank you that was theresponse I was looking for so um thatCommunity will be listening with um uhopen ears don't doit as long as we're talking about DHTdihydro testosterone um it's only fair"

whotake these drugs particularly in oralform experience um sexual dysfunctionissues um and other issues related tosuppressing DHT that said myunderstanding is that these drugs arealso quite useful maybe even life-savingin some cases for um staving off certainforms of prostatecancer what are your thoughts aboutfinasteride taster do you see peoplecoming into your clinicwho are having sexual dysfunction orother types of issues because of theirhair or attempt to maintain or growtheir hair issues and um equallyimportant is that we talk aboutso-called post finasteride syndrome Igot a lot of questions about postfinasterid syndrome um because I'lldescribe it in a couple of minutes um itsounds pretty devastating for thesepeople's lives um and I'll explain whyit's so devastating for them um in amoment but you what about asidedutasteride and these drugs that areeffectively DHT blockers um DHT levelsif they get too high indeed canminiaturize the hair follicle causepeople to lose their hair typically upfront or in the back so-called crown orwhatever you know Widows Peak uh uh uhor everywhere in some cases um it alsoinduces hair growth on the back beardgrowth as we understand but then peoplego and take these drugs to try andmaintain or grow their hair and oftentimes they have erectile dysfunction orother issues isues is that surprising toyou you know I think the men that we seethese um these side effects are are tendto be you know younger men in their 20s30s and 40s uh and they' take it asyou're pointing out for hair loss sobefore it was FDA approved for thatindication at least finasteride was youknow they did randomized control trialsto look um and one of the other thingsthat we we'll talk about too is justreproductive effects so they did youknow lots of studies to see if therewere changes in semen quality you knowfor men on finasteride versus theplacebo and there were some very subtlechanges but you know sort of inpostmarketing now we see these patientsin clinic um you know everybody toenroll in these studies had normalfunction so I think that's sort ofimportant to understand and obviouslythat's not life right that people comein with sort of different baselines anddifferent amounts of reserve and so wenow know that there's probably peoplethat are a lot more sensitive to thesemedications than others and so there aresome men that drop their sperm countsdramatically and usually if we're westop these medications their sperm CScan recover you know usually aspermatogenic cycle is probably about 2to 3 months so usually in maybe 3 to 6months we usually see recovery for mostmen um but similarly for you know sexualfunction I certainly you know have anumber of patients you know that docomplain of low libido erectile functionthis post finasteride syndrome um youknow and the mechanisms I think are lesscertain because you know measuringtestosterone levels which we do you knowsometimes if androgens are low or evenif androgens seem to be in the maybenormal range or low normal range willtry and increase testosterone through avariety of means testosterone chopinesometimes will give you know it helpssome men but not all so I think theexact mechanism of what is going on herewhat is changing I think um you know weneed more you know more understandingabout the exact sort of path ofphysiology um neur you know orneurochemically it seems like a prettyserious trade-off to either maintain togrow hair or lose sexual function I meantalked about DHT and some of these umside effects of Finas do test ride on umprevious episodes and you know I'm not aclinician but my encouragement is alwaysfor people to approach these drugs witha with a real level of seriousness ifnot caution um the post finasteridesyndrome was described in these onlinequestions as seemingly permanent eventhough um people had ceased to takefinasteride or dutasteride so in otherwords they were taking this stuff they Idon't know how they felt while they wereon it but they stopped taking it and thesexual dysfunction issues um don't seemto be resolving um does that mean theyshould go see uh you or another uh maleurologist reproductive health specialistyeah I mean oftentimes they do for youknow these complaints um you know theystart to notice it when they're on themedication then when they you knowusually through online research kind oflearn about this potential entitysometimes they discontinue now some mendo have resolution when they stop butthere is this permanence in some handfulof men um you know they've done you knowMRI IM to try and understand sort of youknow more anatomically or functionallywhat exactly is going on I think there'sstill a lot of unknowns about it but itcan be you know permanent for some sothey come in you know and they see me inclinic erec all dysfunction low libidoand then we go down all the the host oftreatments that we talked about inevaluations that we talked about againwe have resolution in some but there aresome that seem treatment refractoryyikes that's my only response Imean permanent effects uh on SexualHealth in it as a consequence of anattempt to maintain one's hair I meanthis is where you know um in allseriousness it it it just sounds likesomething that um people need to thinkvery seriously about because as Iunderstand there's nothing that canpredict whether or not someone willhave post finasteride syndrome rightright um and I did um a bit of readingon this uh within the scientificjournals as well there isn't a lot ofinformation as you point out becauseit's a fairly recent phenomenon and thathighlights a different issuethis may be the first time in historywhere young males are taking finasterideand dutasteride and that might be thecause of the postfastr syndrome right Ithink you you alluded to this earlierright these drugs have proven to be verybeneficial for older men treatingprostate issues exactly yeah right sothis is a post finasterid syndrome um Ithink falls under the category ofmedical conditions that um you know afew years ago we we would hear the sameabout um chronic fatigue syndromeeven fibromyalgia not long ago wasconsidered one of these oh is it all apsychosomatic issue now we we nowclearly know that's not the case forfibromyalgia by the way um but I canrecall a time not that long ago whenpeople um in the medical profession kindof like well yeah this I don't know ifthis is a real thing but postfastrsyndrome sounds certainly real for thepeople that are suffering from itexactly yeah yeah okay well the reasonI'm spending so much time on this isthat um I get a lot of questions aboutit and there clearly a lot of youngmales who take fastrite or do tast rideor are thinking of doing that um forcosmetic reasons and I think they shouldbe aware of the potentially seriousconsequences yeah agree yeah but you didsay earlier that if someone has a penisyou can get it hard so um so all is notlost even for these post finasteridsyndromes individual good okay we'llhold use that um you mentionedchopine um could you explain what"

            "text": "and volume wasn't also measured and andthat's something that we haven'tdiscussed um what is the relationshipbetween testicular size and volume umand some of the other parameters we'vebeen talking about and maybe this isalso a good time to highlight umany kind of um morphological signalsthat uh would warrant people coming tothe clinic so asymmetry in testical sizefor instance um changes in testicularsize um obviously a psize lump uh theytaught us in uh High School is um awarning sign of potential testiculartumor or cancer um yeah we didn't reallytalk about testicles yeah so I thinkthat yeah kind of being aware you knowthe average size of um a testicle for aman is about you know sort of about awalnut so it's about 16 to 20CC's um you usually if you're going tomeasure it it' be about four to four anda half centimeters and longest axis togive you know your listeners or viewerssome idea um if it changes certainly letpeople know if you feel anything letpeople know although um our uh you knowNational guidelines on screeningpractices recommends against regulartesticular self- exams interestinglybecause I think the concern is that itleads to more anxiety than cancers thatit would diagnose but I think you know Ialways tell men no one knows yourscrotum better than you so if youidentify you know problem you shouldbring it to attention so you know theclassic appearance or the way that atestos cancer would manifest is a firmpainless mass that you kind of feelcoming from the testicle um I find itinteresting that um at least as Iunderstand women are encouraged to doregular self- exams of their breasts forfor lumps so but you're telling me thatmen are discouraged from doing regularexams of their testicles for lumps thatcould be cancer that feels like a umunfairasymmetry it does I mean Cancer I meanboth both seem very important um oh yeahwell I think there's no questionobviously I'm very biased yeah yeah Iwas trying to say it so you didn't haveto right oh yeah I don't want to get introuble with the US I don't want anyoneto get cancer I mean I so um I don'teven want a dog to get cancer um so I'msurprised that they discourage self-examum but is it because men are getting itwrong they're coming into the clinicthinking they have testicular cancer andthen most of the time they don't I thinkthat's the concern that you know thenumber of cancers that are diagnosedversus the false you know um the falseyou know lumps that they identify justlead to more anxiety and end up notactually you know causing more harm thangood I think is the concern but um yeahit was a surprising recommendation whenit came down usually if patients askabout it I certainly don't discouragethem from doing these exams and I havewe've certainly identified cancersthrough that means before well I saw theepisode of er where the guy was havingtrouble breathing when he was an eliteRunner and it turned out he hadtesticular cancer and he had overlookedthe lump on his testicle so I'm going tocontinue to self-screen okay fair enoughnumerous times today we've talked aboutthe potential benefit of getting a bloodtest for hormone profiles lipid profilesand other things as well as a spermanalysis um my understanding is that onecan only do that if they have thedisposal I income to elect to do thatthrough some commercial online serviceum but is there any way that um patientswho have insurance can uh approach theirphysician in a way that this would becovered by Insurance um I don't want toget you into any trouble here but I youknow it's it's always such a shame it issuch a shame when we're talking aboutsomething that is really um perpervasively related to health has hisSexual Health reproductive health andpeople are not aware of a potentialproblem in the present or in the futurethat could have been mitigated simplybecause they didn't get a blood test ordo something as simple as a um a spermanalysis um so we can't be presumptuousand saying oh well you know two $200 or$1,000 is no big deal I mean for a lotof people that's a huge deal right umit's prohibitive um for many people sohow can people get this stuff assessedum should they talk to their primarycare physician should they um call aurologist what's the best approach yeahI think both are good strategies I thinkyou know insurance is becoming a lotmore open to covering some infertilityat least testing sometimes treatment aswell so I think a lot of insurance doescover that now you know sometimes wecheck cement analyses for other Jacoryissues um but I think that you knowagain as more of this data gets out Ithink as more recognition how importantthe mail is I think we'll get um sort ofmore buying and coverage obviously womenhave you know the automatic feedback ofobory Cycles so they kind of know and ifthere's a problem they can bring that tothe attention but men don't have thatfeedback without some of these testingyeah and we probably should havementioned this earlier so forgive me I Ithis was on me to mention that when wetalk about sperm quality and we sort ofshifted back and forth to semen qualityit's possible to have um normal semenvolume and have very low sperm countright we're not talking about the totalamount of ejaculate per se we're talkingabout the density of forwardly motilehealthy non-dna fragmented sperm in thatsemen right so in other words it's notsufficient to just um assume because uhyou can ejaculate that your sperm arehealthy that's exactly right yeah I meanI think you know about 15% of men havelow Seamon quality whether it beconcentration movement shape about 1% ofmen have no sperm in the ejaculate andthat's something sometimes they have noidea about so the only way to know wouldbe to actually do a formal test well I'mencouraging people um to get theseparameters assessed and I'm I'm makingthat statement um because it's veryclear based on everything that you'vetold us today that sperm quality andhormone levels are just oh so importantum not just for sexual health um but forurinary health and for reflectingprostate health and other aspects ofwhole body health and and um SexualHealth relates um directly to mentalhealth right we we didn't talk so muchabout the psychogenic issues but um thetwo go hand inand EXA I want to thankyou so much for coming here today andsharing so much knowledge with us I meanthese really are the issues that ummales think about and wonder about andum have questions about um and they doso to varying degrees depending on wherethey're at in life um but I thinkespecially for younger men who arehearing this um who are not at the pointwhere they want to conceive um it'sreally important to start thinking aboutthese issues for all the all the reasonsyou mentioned I think these issues arereally important um for women to knowabout as well just as it's important formen to understand uh female reproductivehealth and and uh to not just improvecommunication but this after all um isat the heart of the uh the presence andproliferation of our species so thanksfor taking care of the male half and umuh and thanks for doing the work you doit's incredible um the large scalestudies the the more detailed thestudies the um on smaller populationsthe you ask the questions that it seemsum many people are just afraid to askand and you get right in there and andcome out with the the really rigorousdata and answer so thank you so much forwhat you do my pleasure thank you thankyou for highlighting men's reproductiveHealth thank you for joining me fortoday's discussion with Dr Michael"
