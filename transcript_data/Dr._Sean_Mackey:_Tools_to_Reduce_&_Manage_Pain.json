            "text": "this is a long time coming we'recolleagues at Stanford and I'm familiarwith your work but today we're going totake a pretty Broad and deep survey ofthis thing called pain so I'll juststart off very simply and ask what ispain pain is this complex and subjectiveexperience that serves a crucial rolefor all of us to keep us away frominjury orharm it is both a sensory and anemotional experience and I think thatgets lost on people that includes thisemotional component to it and it isincredibly individual and we'll get moreinto that hopefully as time goes by thatyou know your pain is different from mypain and is different from everybodyelse's it takes an incredible toll onsociety when it goes chronic when itbecomes persistent to the tune of abouta 100 million Americans and at lastcount about a half a trillion dollars ayear in medical expenses uh so anastounding problem we're facing insociety and one that's only gettingworse and I'm hoping during the courseof this discussion that we can kind ofbreak down a little bit of thefoundation of pain and kind of build itback up becauseunfortunately uh in society there's alot of misunderstanding about what painis and I think uh hopefully we can buildthat foundation and then layer on somesome useful treatments and usefuloptions for people I'm glad you pointedout this link between the sensory andthe emotional experience every once in awhile I'll pull something or I'll havelike you know like a kink in my neck ormy back and fortunately for me itresolves pretty quickly but I noticethat when I'm experiencing that kind ofpain that I become slightly moreirritable perhaps much more irritabledepending on who you ask and thateverything becomes more challengingthinking is harder sleeping is harderconcentrating on anything besides painit's it's a um it's as if something'snagging from the inside and so thatraises the the next question that I havewhich isis pain something that's in our brain inour body or both it's clearly in ourbrain and can I take a moment to kind oflay a little foundation for some of thatto help clear up some of the mystery ofpain we know that pain most pain allstarts with some stimulus whether it bethat kink in your neck or your shoulderfrom working out or turning the wrongway and what's going on there uh in yourbody is not pain what's going on is thatuh there are sensors in our skin oursoft tissue our deep tissues callednoors and these noors are sensingelements and they sense different typesof stimuli they can sense temperature uhheat cold they sense pressure they cansense pH changes due to for instanceinflammation that may occur from uh anysomething going on in your neck or yourshoulder those signals up nerve fibertypes and the two that we we refer toare a Delta and C fibers one transmitsvery fast it's responsible that you knowsharp jolt of pain that goes to yourbrain when we uh you know step on a tackor put our hand on a hot stove andthere's another fiber called a CA fiberwhich is much slower and responsible forthat dull achy pain now these signalsthey go to the spinal cord lie up anddown our uh from our head down to ourback and they're they're shaped they'rechanged a littlebit they then are sent up to the brainand it's once they hit the brain andthey converge with this Magical Mysteryset of nerves in the brain that itbecomes the experience of pain and ifthere's one key message I'd like to getto the audience is that what goes on outhere what goes on in your shoulder inyour neck is not pain that's nosusception those areelectrical signals electrochemicalimpulses being transmitted and that isto be distinguished from what becomesthe subjective experience of pain thatyou have and why it'scritical is that our brain serves somany functions of emotions cognitions uhmemory action all of that shapes thosesignals coming in from our body tocreate your unique experience of painthat's different from everybodyelse's and I think that's important tonotebecause we are frequently left with thisnotion of thisonetoone concordance between thestimulus and the experience of pain youknow Renee Dart that French uhphilosopher I think 17thcentury um was the one who firstpostulated this idea of this directlinkage between the body and our actionsand the stimulus and the response andit's wrong and unfortunately even inmedical care we have this biomedicalmodel that still is perpetuating thisidea of a onetoonerelationship and that's a criticallyimportant point to getacross in large part because frequentlyas humans we tend to project onto othersour own experiences of pain and when wesee somebody who's got an injury orsomething else going on we immediatelyput that on them and that has also beena problem uh with many people sufferingin chronic pain which is often viewed asthe invisible disease so when you say weput that on them you mean when somebodyreports being in pain we have a hardtime understanding what they're areexperiencing because it's going to bevery different than the way that weexperience pain conversely if somebody'sin pain they tend to assume that peopleare experiencing pain the way that theyare do I have that right you have itperfectly right and it actually if I canbuild on that gets worse becausesometimes you have conditions likefibromyalgia that maybe we'll get intowhere outwardly visibly you don't seeanything wrong we're used to thinking ofpain as a fractured you know bone as aswollen ankle we see that and then welike okay well you've got pain you gotlegitimate pain whereas this invisibledisease of chronic pain frequently youdon't have something outwardly thatyou're seeing but we bring in our ownhistory of pain and we put that on otherpeople I have a question that's somewhatmechanistic but we'll keep it accessible"

or is itat the level of the brain or both yeahand this is where some of the challengeswe get into with language becausetechnically nids nonsteroidalanti-inflammatory drugs like ibuprofenlikeNaperson they're actually not analgesicsthey're not technically pain killers soan analgesic is the descriptor for aquote unquote painkiller yeah there thatwould be more correct like an opioidwould be would fit into that categorythe N heads are anti-inflammatory drugsthey're also there's another this is atechnical term they'reanti-hyperalgesic drugs andso one of the things that happens afteran injury is that we getsensitization of the area that's injuredand it's a beautiful thing because itsends a message to us to protect it umwhat the end heads do is they reducesome of that sensitization out in theperiphery and then back in the spinalcord and in the brain but they don'tactually so for instance I was going tosay try this at home but probably notyou can um in a normal situation youknow hit your hand with a fork measurethe amount of pain I'll go take an NSAIDlike ibuprofen if you hit your hand withthat same Fork there'll be no differencefolks please don't do that don't do thatat home please yeah or any or anywherefor that matter or anywhere for thatmatter but you're describing pain andthe local inflammation response and thehyper Alesia the increase in pain inthat general area as something veryadaptive very important so it raises thequestion what is the threshold forsaying that somebody should treat theirpain reduce their pain I mean you knowanytime I've done um you know surgerieson animals which I don't do anymore inthe laboratory but we used to you knowyou would give them painkillerspost-operatively I've had iies before Ihad painkillers postoperatively althoughI don't like taking them I don't likethe way they make my brain feel and souh but we of course know that if youincrease the dose of any pain medicationtoo much then that animal or a human canpotentially injure themselves worse ornot protect that injured area so itraises a whole set of sort of medicalethical but also just purely biologicalquestions how do you set the thresholdfor yes blunt pain versus no allow thepain to be there as an adaptive way ofprotecting yourself in healingpresumably the inflammation is part ofthe healing process too and as youmentioned before pain is so subjectiveand it's different between all of us Imean how do we decide uh whether or notit's a good or bad idea to blunt thatpain yeah I think the the the thresholdis when it's impacting your quality oflife and your ability to take care ofactivities at daily living engage withfamily friends go to workand that that s kind of a your yourthreshold for you know whether it'sreasonable to to take a medication ornot it's a lot of controversy in thespace right now it used to be we allrecommended just Neds for any type ofacute injury I is non-steroidanti-inflammatory drugs indeed couldcould we maybe list off a few of thoseso I mentioned ibuprofen aceto Menin sosometimes referred to as you know theclassic Advil Tylenol we won't throw outname brands there but what are someothers Naproxin neoen is another oneToral or ketorolac is another one thetwo over-the-counter nids theprototypical over-the-counter ones areibuprofen and napasin those are the onesyou can buy over the counter without aprescription uh Tylenol actually has aslightly different mechanism of injurybut you know still fits in that samegeneral class it tends to be morecentrally acting IBU uh Tylenol orcamenen but take we say centrally youmean Brain Brain Brain thank you thanyou and uh is aspirin considered aninsat I don't believe as would fit intothat category of basically a Cox cycoxygenase inhibitor this is one of thethe chemical mediators that getsreleased during injury and that chemicaluh substance has a tendency to wind upor amplify thenoors so that after an injury you notethat you're more sensitive there after asunburn you end up having moresensitization that is what we refer toas peripheral sensitization because it'sout in the periphery we're winding up oramplifying theresponse uh aspirin n heads in generalwill reduce that inflammation they'reanti- umhyperalgesic and uh pardon again thejargony terms that we use but hopecoming across along as we go but but youknow to your point you don't want to forinstance let's imagine you have afractured ankleyou don't want to be reaching for a verypotentopioid just so that you can continuewalking on a fractured ankle that youhaven't gotten evaluated by a clinicianand perhaps casted that wouldn't be safethose are rather extreme examples youknow we get into those debates right inprofessional sports where you know theythey send the person back out on thefield with a broken bone you know havinggiven them an ejection or something I'mI'm hoping that doesn't go on anymorebut uh I'm sure it goes on okay yeahwell there's all sorts of other things Iget contacted all the time professionalteams and athletes asking how they canget back in quicker nowadays the bigthing are these uh peptides that cancertainly accelerate healing people aretraveling out of country get stem cellinjections all with all with uh very fewrandomized control trials but I assureyou that um Courtside and in the lockerroom mainly in the locker room theircorticosteroid injections theirpainkiller injections I mean it's it'snot at any expense but it's not far fromthat okay yeah yeah well you know whenyou're you're making millions of dollarsa year and I I get the being back on thefield but for the rest of us meremortals um I think that's where we wouldwant to draw a line get medicalattention if you've got an acute injurygoing a little bit deeper into mechanism"

prandin because Ithink there are a lot of people nowadayswe hear about inflammation yeah you knowinflammation's bad inflammation's badbut you know one of the things that wetalk about a lot on this podcast is thefact that you know cortisol isn't badinflammation isn't bad these thingsserve an important biological role sothe prostaglandins seem to be one of themain ways that our immune system uhresponds to a physical or chemicalinjury and and creates inflammation andthat as you said that inflammationsensitizes an area makes it literallymore sensitive and then we introducethese drugs that um to restore normalfunctioning and living could weestablish like what normal functioningis I mean for instance if we make thisreally concrete could we say well if youcan sleep fall asleep at night and stayasleep or perhaps go back to sleep afteryou've woken up in the middle of thenight then will you heal during sleepand so you know take as littlepainkiller as possible but enough thatstill still lets you sleep well at nightis that it's sort of normal functioningbecause when I have a kink in my neck Idon't want to do much of anything I trybut it's really frustrating so what is Imean as a physician how and as a patienthow do we determine normal functioningyeah and you're getting into the Nuancethe complexity of this problem becausewe've been talking about NSAIDs the IBprence andnapins and as I said early on we used tojust give these out all the time butthen the research comes out and showsthat by blocking inflammation byblocking that we may be blocking thenormal healing process and so we've seendelays in fracture repair we've beenseeing delays in tissue repair and sonow you've got on one hand a medicationthat may help with pain help you improvefunction you've got on the other handsomething you're taking that may delaythe process where do you draw the lineas a physician my Approach is reallybasically what you said it's balancingthe fact that if you're not sleeping atnight you're not going to heal andyou're not going to be able to do whatyou need to do the next day and iftaking an inset helps you sleep andhelps you uh engage with what you needto do take it at the lowest dose thatyou can get awaywith I've heard before that NAD shouldbe taken no more than once every sixhours people will alternate differenttypes of insthat's usually try reduce fever anothersituation where an Adaptive responsefever you know people go out of theirway to block it right prevent the brainfrom cooking but again opens up the sameset of issues and so I'm wondering ifsomebody has some pain that makes youknow moving about frustrating and it'sand it's difficult but you know they cansleep at night reasonably well maybe notas well as they normally do would yoursuggestion to that person if their goalis to heal as quickly as possible tojust not take anything yeah so we've gota lot more data on the benefits of nidsthis class of medication reducing painthen we have data uh showing the badconsequences of it and so we're stillneeding more data on the whole healingmessage I think that a lot of theorthopedic surgeons out there preferpeople not to be on IDs after forinstance a total hip replacement attotal knee replacement because I thinkthat's pretty clear but that's not whatwe're talking about right now so so oneof the other interesting things about nheads like we mentioned ibuprofin andaprin huge individual variability aroundthose so personally ibuprofen is notvery effective for me napasin is forothers it may be just exactly theopposite so there's value in rotatingthem and finding out which works bestfor your particular situation youmentioned the timing of it ibuprofen istypically given no more than three timesa a day it's got a short halflifeNaperson twice a day what's critical Ineed to give this message is in bothsituations make sure that you have foodin your stomach make sure you're nottaking it on an empty stomach make sureyou're drinking plenty of fluids and ifyou've got any um GI issues if you'vegot any bleeding issues if you've gotkidney issues if you've got heart issuestalk to your doc talk to your clinicianbefore you embark on this because thesemedications do have side effects andadverse consequences in vulnerablepeople and what about aspirin I've heardthat aspirin can benefit heart health soI take a baby aspirin every day and if Ihave a pain that is just too intense fornormal functioning as we're defining itthen I'll increase that um dose ofaspirin and I just assume aspirin is thehealthiest and sad for me because wellit's also good for heart health and it'skilling pain in those instances asopposed to taking anything else is mylogic flawed and if it is feel free totell me no for for you your logic isperfect and that's where it gets to theindividual person and for a lot ofpeople that model would work as well sobaby asper in 81 milligrams a day actsas an antiplatelet agent it helps youknow here even though we're gettingcontroversy over the role of babyaspirin if you dive into the currentliterature even baby aspirin iscontroversial even baby aspirin thesedays and now what they're doing withwith the data is defining age rangeswhen they say baby aspirin yes babyaspirin no and so you know we'relearning a lot more about that I stilltake a baby aspirin every day yeah Itake a baby aspirin you get to thehigher dose is say four times as much uparound 325 milligrams or so it's now ananti-inflammatory it's now acting morelike the ibuprofen and thenapasin so um different mechanisms ofaction at differentdoses I'd like to take a brief moment"

right where you know we allhave this instinctual response animalshave it too right if they uh you bumpyour knee or your toe that you grab andyou rub it and that that rubbingresponse is actually contributing to theactivation of a neural pathway that doesindeed reduce the pain through alegitimate neural inhibition and tell meif this is still considered correct andthen I'll let you um uh elaborate on itbut I think that is an opportunity forus to also talk more generally or foryou to educate us more generally on thethe mechanistic interventions for painlike um maybe massage above or below thesight of pain maybe acupuncture um soagain there will be chemicalconsequences of any mechanicalintervention right as we know becausethat's the language of the nervoussystem electricity and chemicals but asopposed to taking a drug you can imagineusing manual um stimulation or rubbingaround it or or perhaps we can also talkabout heat and cold so can we explorethat space a bit absolutely and firstyou're right so uh in your first part uhpack uh Patrick Wall Ron mzac luminariesin the field of pain back in the 60s uhdefined the gate control theory of painand one of the things to build on thestory that we talked about with noreceptors going to the spinal signalsgoing to the spinal cord heading up tothe brain where the perception of painoccurs that's not where the story endsit turns out there are Pathways thatcome down from the brain down from thebrain to the spinal cord that act in aninhibitory role and we'll build on thosealso from theperiphery we've got also fibers calledtouch fibers these are the ones wherethey get activated with light touchstroking they refer to as a beta fibersthey're fastconducting they head back to the spinalcord and they make someconnections with those notivefibers so with that grounding imaginewhat you said your you hit your thumbwith a hammer you um uh you bangsomething on an extremity uh what is thefirst thing you do when you hit yourthumb with a hammer uh some people rubit I yell some people swear and it turnsout there are studies that show thatswearing works really swearing reducespain better than uh than usingnon-explicitcan go out and swear every time they'rein pain well they can but they'll haveto bear the consequences on anindividual basis we're not we're we'reabsolving ourselves of anyresponsibility right so uh rubbing uhshaking is another one which basicallyis activating those touch fibers oh itis I do that everybody does thateverybody does that running it underwatwhich you know it doesn't matter whetheryou know in this case it's hot or it'scold water it's the running of the waterunderneath it and what ises it doing weall think it's reducing the stimulus outhere and it is not at in the peripheryin the periphery what's magical aboutthat I think which is so cool is you'reactually changing the signals in yourspinal cord way back here in the neckthis is the cheapest free version ofwhat we refer to asneuromodulation that's ever beendiscovered um you're actually by doingthat you're changing things theconnections back in your spinal cord andit'sreducing the no susceptive signalscoming in here that's why we do it andit works it works beautifully that's whywhen a kid gets their boo boo you knowparents come and rub it it works whatabout the kiss the kids sometimes theywant to kiss you know or a romanticpartner will sometimes like injurethemselves I guess it depends on thenature of the relationship and they'llsay like can you kiss it of course youknow then you kiss it and then like theyfeel better is that purelypsychological well okay I think animportant point to to to ground herewhen it comes to the experience of painis that everything when we saypsychological means Neuroscience I knowyou know that no no forgive me I I I Ihave to be careful with with the thewording that I use that's my fault butbut it's it's accurate still it ispsychological but it is neurosciencebased I mean they're really becoming oneand the same but to answer your questionyes by kissing it you're activatingtouch fibers we can also agree thatthere's a positive emotional saliencethat's associated with that and thatpositive emotional salience is reducingpaintoo what interesting up wall and melacsometime later uh there was theintroduction of a device to takeadvantage of this called the tens deviceand tens is an acronym transcutaneouselectrical neurosstimulation and what the tenens deviceis doing and there's many versions of itnow but there are those black electrodyou put over the area and they're hookedup to wires and when you turn it on itcauses a buzzingsensation and that buzzing sensation isactivating those touch fibers the a betafibers and so it's causing thatneuromodulation back in the spinal cordamazing it's cool stuff it's very cooland I and I love that you emphasize thatwhen we're rubbing the periphery orshaking our hand the periphery againbeing the body surface away from thebrain that the real mechanism of actionis taking place back in the spinal cordbecause it really speaks to the thebody-wide and the the circuit wide thenervous systemwide nature of this thingthat we

this is truethat if you have a lot of adrenalineepinephrine in your system that yourthreshold for pain goes way wayup there's probably a chemical basis forthat and maybe it's all you know umanecdote but um certainly people havedifferent thresholds for pain I forinstance do not have a high painthreshold but I've noticed I have a veryquick pain response so if I stub my toeit feels like the most painful thing Icould possibly experience but then it'sgone very quickly so it's like a quickinflection and then down other people Iknow uh we've never done the experimentI think I see them stub their toe andthey're like ah and then you know 10minutes later they're still feeling theache so whose pain threshold is higherit's a it depends on how you define painthreshold so so how do we Define painthreshold what determines pain thresholdand I guess the $6 million question arethere different pain thresholds betweenmen and women as it relates to the wholestory about childbirth being verypainful and that Women quote unquotehave higher pain thresholds I just Ijust sent you about 10 questions forgiveme yeah um so what is pain thresholdyeah no it's a it's a great place tostart andmaybe I don't know if you want to Circleback around at some point to the heatand cold to finish up the mechanical butfor no no no you're let me answer yourget to your pain threshold so the painthreshold is uh that stimulus intensitythat results in the onset of theexperience of pain the first onset ofthe experience of pain so you know whenyou turn up the heat it's it's not whenit's warm it's not when it's just hotit's when the the heatbecomes the perception of pain like whenit becomes painfully hot at that pointin time the same works for cold youmentioned some of the distinctionbetween your experiences of pain to astimulus and your buddies and that'snormal that first onset of pain againthose are those fast fibers those adDelta fibers boom right to your brainthose are the protective ones that whenwe put our hand on a hot stove weimmediately Jerk it back we don't evenhave a conscious perception yet that wedid that and then it's a moment laterwhen the sea fibers are getting up tothe brain and the other AD Delta fibersare converging into conscious areas ofbrain that we're like oh wow that stoveis reallyhot and the ca fibers in particular areconverging on more emotional regions inthe brain that are conveying anunpleasantness to that experience youdon't like it you and you don't want itto happen again which is why it encodesmemories so you only had to do that onceas achild now getting into the the painthresholds you asked one of the otherquestions is do men and women havedifferent pain um thresholds uh theanswer the short answer is yes this hasbeen establishedand I want to be careful here withsaying a couple things one is in generaluh men have uh higher paining thresholdsto things like heat stimulus thanwomen and what what people have to alsothoughunderstand as scientists we make a bigdeal out of small differences right youknow what we do is we take a group ofpeople in this case men andwomen and we apply the same uh thermalstimulus to them and we drawaverages the average man has thisstimulus the average woman has thisstimulus and we say well women have havea little bit more sensitivity to thatheat stimulus and so we then go into thepress and we say uh men are tougher thanwomen that's a terrible statement rightbecause the tough part is a subjectivelabel right I mean it it it gets to awhole bunch of different issues aroundthe Adaptive role of pain right I mean Imean one could argue that if yourthreshold for pain is lower that your itserves a more adaptive function rightfewer injures Etc I mean I guess it getsinto the implications of what we mean byquote unquote tougher it does but italso misses I think the big point whichis people are notaverages so what I mean by that is umwhile the average for a woman may besomewhat less than a man if you look atthe distribution of the curves theyhighlyoverlap meaning the individualvariability within men and within womenis much greater than the differencebetween men and women but there's plentyof women on that curve that have muchgreater heat uh thresholds than men Dohbut when you pull things you end up withthat difference unfortunately whenthings are picked up and you want aquick sound bite out of it that's whatit gets distilled down to so so it's notunlike height for that matter I me therea lot of women that are taller than menthat's exactly it but on average men aretaller than women on average and I wouldsay within this area of uh painthreshold differences it's even closerit's eventighter you know it would be I'm makingthis up the equivalent I think theaverage height of a woman is 53 5'4 theaverage height of a man 5'9 510 this isImagining the average height being youknow 5'6 for a woman and 5'8 for a manyou know it's not a hugedifference there's a lot of things thatplay into to changes in pain"

canI interject a question yeah if one wastold just suck it up a lot or if onewhimpered or cursed when they uh hurtthemselves if they were told um you knowdon't be a wuss don't be awimp do we know whether or not thatincreases or decreases the subjectivefeeling of pain later I could imagine itgoing either way I could imagine the kidthat was told don't be a wuss when theycried as a consequence of expressingpain or an experience of pain secretlyfeeling more pain because they aren'table to express the emotionality aroundthe pain but that if we just look fromthe outside we say wow like pretty toughadult right because they're not umcrying out in pain so do we have any arethere any experiments that have exploredthat I don't know you're getting intothis is a good point getting into um uhpediatric pain and you know if there'sbeen experiments in that space I staymainly in the adult area and myexperience with raising a child is an Nof one with one son um he's done greatthank you I happen to know him very wellhe's a he's he's what you call a greatexample of Highly Successfulreproduction so you know it's say whatdo they say it's better to be lucky thangood uh so sure I'm sure there was a lotinvolved so don't don't discount don'tuh don't discard any credit thank youthank you um you know my Approach withIan was not to say just you knownecessarily suck it up but I would uhyou know make light of it i' I'd havefun with it and uh I would kind of laughand I'm like way to go buddy uh and Iwould find he would often laugh you knowso I think a lot of it is the cuesthey're taking off the parents you knowand again this is this is just my oneofend parent is if they see you freakingout kid's going to freak out too um butdoes there get to be a point whereyou're ignoring your child or your lovedOn's painful issue yeah now you'regetting into some maladaptive some badspace where I think it's sending thatperson the wrong message and they mayvery well have problems lateron I will tell just a very briefanecdote when I was growing up Iobserved a total of zerochildren and friends who you know criedout in pain or complained of pain whowere told you know um that was aninappropriate response um sometimes Imight have heard parents say you knowcome on just suck it up or like or rubit you'll be okay that kind of thing butonce and only once with had some friendsI won't tell you what country they werefrom but they they lived not far from umwhere both Ian and I grew up since wegrew up near one another and I'll neverforget that the younger brother of afriend of mine ran over to the father hehad cut his thumb on the band saw and itwasn't particularly deep but he wascrying in pain and the father wrapped itpicked up his chin and smacked himacross the face and said don't ever dothat again and so what I think he wasdoing was compounding the the lessonabout the saw yeah but clearly had noregard for the pain that the that theinjury probably caused now I haven'tfollowed up with that kid um I think wecan all agree that by today's standardsthat would be considered um abusiveparenting uh or perhaps um you know onecould say that was you know on the farextreme of a response but I'll neverforget that and I went home and I I toldmy mom yeah and she said oh yeah when Iwas growing up that was actually a morefrequent response to kids hurting themthemselves especially boys and so thingshave really changed in terms of how wereact to children in pain but the reasonI find this interesting is thatultimately what we're talking about ishow should we interpret our own painyeah can I can I make a commentary aboutthat scenario and I want to bring inanother Neuroscience concept that thatDad may have been doinginadvertently and that's somethingcalled conditioned painmodulation so there's another coolphenomenon in in pain that pain inhibitspain so what I mean by that is when youwere you know this guy this kid but oryourself growing up did you ever walk upto your buddy and say you know my my armreally hurts you know I injured it theother day and what did what did yourbuddy do they'd stomp on your foot andyou'd say why the heck did you do thatyou I must have growing up with the samefriends oh yeah yeah and and they'd saywell now doesn't doesn't your arm feelbetter and i' be like well yeah it doesand yeah I did grow up with thosefriends I tell this story to some peopleand I sometimes just get the wide eyeslike they did what yeah we are notmaking recommendations here we're notmaking recommendations but it's a realphenomenon it was described byLaars late 70s 78 or something like thatin rodent models initially and whathappens is that when you engage a nosusceptive stimulus or a painfulstimulus and a site distal differentfrom where the primary pain is itengages a brain stem circuit that hasdescending Pathways to the spinal cordand inhibits pain amazing pain inhibitspain it works it also is thought to havesome contributions from higher braincenters we call this whole phenomenonlears called this phenomenon diffusenoxious inhibitory control or denck thehuman version of this is calledconditioned pain modulation why I bringthis up not only to help explain thatfather's actionssomehow I don't think that he wasthinking oh my kid's got a painful uhyou know hand or finger he cut himselfI'm going to slap him off the side ofthe head he'll feel better I don't thinkthat's what was going through his headhe wanted to make him feel worse so hedidn't go near the band saw withoutbeing more cautious but it probably didreduce the pain a little bit to someextent now where it's key is oh my maybewe'll get into it later with chronicpain is in some chronic painfulconditions the CPM or the denck doesn'twork m like fibromyalgia beingone um so pain inhibits pain uh isanother Neuroscience concept related topain that's rathercool well and I'm sorry I missed yourquestion to could you repeat noing youanswer the question and and uh expand iton it in a in a completely surprisingand far more interesting way than I everanticipated so thank you I I'm bettingthat 98% of people listening to thisincluding myself have never heard thatpain inhibits pain incredible let's goback to heat and cold we briefly touchedon heat but let's talk about the use ofuh quote unquote therapeutic heat ortherapeutic cold a cold pack for a youknow a you know a bruise that reallyaches or maybe even a break or a sprainor heat you know the in the world ofsport physio cold is now heavily debatedlocalized cold is heavily debated youknow you get people saying things Idon't know if this is

somehot water in the hot water bottle lie onthat thing watch some cartoons i'definitely felt better sure sure wellputting aside the Contemporarycontroversies over the mechanisms youdescribed which are I think very realand need to be sorted out traditionallyhistorically we tend to think ofapplying cold for the first 48 hours orso after an acute injury and then heatthereafter cold has some really cooleffects cold uh reduces inflammation soit reduces some of the release of thoseinflammatory chemicals we talked aboutprostaglandins cyto histamines um otherchemo kindes all these fancy terms forsubstances thatsensitize the primaryNoor and it reduces the release of thoseand it reduces inflammation another coolthing often not appreciated is nervesdon't fire as fast when they're cold andso if you've got no acceptors that arefiring and you putcold it's slowing the number of signalscoming up and by definition it'sreducing the the the ultimately the painyou're experiencing now heat heat has anobvious effect of increasing blood flowit's going to help uh relax muscles andget blood into those muscles and that'sprobably why you were putting that hotwater bottle on um and it just darnfeels good and so what what do I tellpeople you know in part I tell peopleuse whichever works best for them um Ifind there's huge individualvariability in whether people like heator likecold and withinreason uh they're safe what do I meanwithin reason don't go putting an icepack on an extremity for two hours youknow you'll get afrostbite so you know take care withthat how cold should one make the pointon their body that's in pain assuming ofcourse that they're not going to givethemselves frostbite meaning do you wantto numb the area you know get past thatpoint point where it's a little bitpainful and then that you know basicallyyou're shutting down some neuralPathways and you don't feel anythingthere it's numb and then you let theblood flow return When you remove thecold pack is that I mean that's areasonable suggestion okay yeah allright well people I think willappreciate that the um the specifics ofthat because um you know and of courselisteners of this podcast often areinterested in whole body deliberate coldimmersion you know cold showers icebaths Etc most people experience thoseas somewhat painful as they get intothem yeah and then can experience somenumbness when they get out is itpossible to raise one's pain thresholdthrough the regular exposure to pain inways that are safe such as deliberatecold exposure assuming that one doesn'tstay in too long and it's not too coldum and or through you know we weretalking about sports earlier but just ingeneral like can we raise our painthreshold so that life is less painfulthe short answer to your last questionis yes um the answer to your otherquestion about about uh extreme cold andcold exposure which I know you have alot of expertise and you can teach me alot I'm going to stay in my wheelhouseat because I I'm not up on theliterature in that space even in itsintersection withpain um it's an intriguing concept uh Ihave toimagine that it makes sense you wouldget somehabituation uh with that repeatedexposure I think one of the thequestions that would come up with forinstance the cold exposure Ure and Idon't know the answer to this but it'sI'm sure maybe somebody out there doesis is there crossmodality um changes in pain thresholds Imean if you expose yourself a lot tocold does it change your heat thresholdsI don't I would surprise be surprised ifit did yeah would or your pressurebecause those are separate parallelPathways yeah yeah you know there uh andyou know as an aside I hate the cold butI do really well with the heat you knowand so does Ian uh you know I thinkthere's something genetic there uh soyou know I mentioned earlier around menand women and heat uh thresholds and Ichose that specifically but each ofthese are different depending on thestimulusmodality can you change ultimately yourthresholds yeah where that involves is alot of cognitive control it's a lot ofcognitive training uh around thatspaceand you know there's there's clearlyapproaches to thatpeople have learned that there'sdifferent manipulations around thatso one experiment this wasn't intendedat least I don't believe so they weremeasuring uh heat thresholds uh oncollege students and and we weexperiment a lot on students as as weall know we pay them well um and whatthey found is that when they're studyingguys studying dudes when there was anattractive woman who was delivering thestimulus the thresholds werehigher because the guys did not want tolook like a wuss in front of thisattractive young woman and that's beenpretty well established so theexperimenter theirgender uh plays a big role in that hasthe reverse experiment also been done Idon't I don't know I don't knowinteresting um but getting back to yourpoint Point yes um I think

thinkabout something else distract oneselffrom the pain or conversely whether ornot one should quote unquote go into thepain so for people who have chronic painMaybe it's in a a small area of the bodythat experiences chronic pain pain quiteoften AK chronic pain or maybe it'swhole body pain I don't think it reallymatters for the question I'm asking andpeople are trying to develop somecognitive ways so what we call asneuroscientists you and I top downmechanisms for like okay I'm going todistract myself from the pain I'm goingto focus on other things I really enjoyor rather I'm going to really go intothe pain meet the pain and realize Idon't know somehow that it's not as badlike somehow there's a and again thisbecomes very opaque right we don'treally know what we're talking aboutwhen we when we do these sorts ofprotocols but those sorts of things areout there in the mindfulness space and Ithink um I certainly take mindfulnessseriously as as an intervention but whatalways bothers me about those sorts ofinterventions is that they lack thespecificity and the granularity andthere's no kind of mechanistic logic toexplain them so what what are yourthoughts on on meeting the pain versusdistracting oneself from the pain let'sbreak that down because there's twoconcepts there as you alluded to andthey're both effective and they bothworkdifferently so one is attentionaldistraction where you are distractingyourself from the thing that is causingpain clearly works in a lot ofpeople and that's why one of thestrategies that we recommend forpatients for people living with pain isto engage in distracting activities reada book um uh go for a walk um spend timewith friends and family in particular inthe community and work to get your mindoff of pain what we've learned is itthat attentional distraction engagesspecific brain networks they tend to besome of the outer layer of brainnetworks in your prefrontal cortex somein your singulate cortexum in other regions which are clearlyinvolved with distraction it's notnecessarily that distraction is going tocompletely eliminate one's pain but itcan reduce it uh significantly and thisiswhy thebiggest problem with distraction from atime of the day is atnight it's when people are trying tosleep during the daytime you can readthat book you can spend time withfriends and family but people withchronic pain that have it 24seven you can't distract yourself atnight when you're trying to get into arelaxed State and fall asleep and that'swhy sleep is such a big issue for peoplewith chronic pain so attentionaldistraction it it works distractionworks now what you said I mean thesecond piece you said kind of let's meetthe pain if you will and there'sdifferent approaches to meeting thepain one approach that you invoked withmindfulness isis addressing the pain from anon-judgmental acceptingmanner I'm aware the pain is there I amnot going to judge it I'm not going toput a value on it's bad it's good oranything I'm just going to note itspresence and that has been shown to workas well in fact actually when John kabatZen originally developedmindfulness-based stress reductionpeople with low backpain PL Studies have shown that it worksI've completed just some recent studiesinmbsr uh as well and we're diving deeplyinto the data so it's thisnon-judgmental acceptance if you will ofthe pain sorry mbsr is the acronym formindfulness based stress reductionmbsr everybody should do mbsr let me beC I have no Financial relationship withany of this by the way butmindfulness-based stress reduction hasbeen shown effective for anxiety fordepression for pain just abouteverything I think they should put itinto all theschools uh it's it's a great skill tolearn no side effects takes a little bitof time to learnit and uh it can be in some peopleeffective and helpful for pain andthat's the key that we're going to keepcoming back to is some of these thingswork for some of the people some of thetime there's a third aspect of meetingthepain and that is more of adirect cognitive reframing about themeaning of the painnow you're coming at the pain and youhave um an approach you're making efforton what you're thinking of thepain is that pain damaging threateningharmful or do you view it as yeah ithurts but it's not harmingme that is a criticalcritical aspect of pain management andthat is serves as a foundation forsomething called cognitive behavioraltherapy the the cool thing about anumber of these is that there's actuallydifferent neural circuitsengaged with these differentapproaches and um I think the key thatwe have to figure out and this is whereresearch is going is which approachworks for which person under whichcircumstance so interesting uh somethingyou said about understanding the painbut not um overinterpreting orcatastrophizing the pain seems importantknowing the difference between beinghurt or feeling hurt versus beinginjured has been something that's beenimportant to me I've been involved insports uh where clearly pain wasinvolved it's like I'm hurt but am Iinjured that's the first question youknow like I've rolled an ankle like ohyou know like I'm limping this hurts amI injured meaning am I going to be backat it in an hour tomorrow versus I'vebroken bones and it's you know you knowgreat empathy for anybody that does likewhen you're injured you feel the snapand you know you're out for a while insome cases um so I think knowing thedifference between being hurt and beinginjured is something that's kind of thatkey moment and for me it's always beenexperienced as a moment of anxiety afterfeeling pain especially in a sports yearlike uh oh like am I am I going to haveto take two weeks off or is this justpain so I think for people to be able torecognize when pain is reporting aninjury versus when pain is justreporting a temporary sensation isreally important and perhaps also forpsychological hurt versus psychologicalinjury I mean that gets to some

couldbe related to physical pain or at leastsimilar enough to it that people'semotional pain is valid right and ifanything I'm here to validate the factthat emotional pain is valid like anyother pain except it is differentbecause it becomes very hard to pointto a specific kind of threshold we'reusing that word a lot today but I thinkit's appropriate here threshold betweenhurt and harmed whereas if

physicalpain you end up putting value judgmentson people and I don't think it serves uswell when we're caring for the person infront of us if they're in pain I'maddressing the pain the thing to note isat least in people that come into our atStanford Pain Management Center andother pain centers is that remember painis a sensory and emotional experienceit's all wrapped up and so we want totreat the wholeperson sometimes we get we get easy weget easy ones and we just go do a nerveblock and pain goes away and that'ssimple but usually it's much morecomplex where we're seeing theinteractionof uh an expression of pain thatincludes includes a significant amountof anxiety of depression you mentionedthis term catastrophizing which we canbreak down if you'd like and that'sprobably one of the biggestpredictors factors in uh inamplification of pain and worsening painand poor treatment response iscatastrophizing um I try to treat thewhole person and not really partial outall this I do at Stanford I you I builta digital Health System that capturesmeasures a lot of data around apatient's experience across physicalpsychological and social functioning andwe use thatdata to Target therapies to understandum how much their depressive symptomsare anxiety anger anger big issue inpain huge in pain does it make it worseor better invariably it makes it worseyeah and you know you can break angerdown in a couple different categoriesJohn Burns and others has broken it intolike anger in versus anger out I don'tknow if that term is familiar withyou um anger out that's myfather um loud loud angryboisterous banging you know wouldquickly turn anything into an angrytiate anger out expressive yelling atthe at the news yes yelling at somebodywho cuts you off in traffic usuallyyelling at the man uh cuz he hated jobum angerin boiling simmering you knowself-containedseething that's angerin data seems to support anger in is isworse it's bad so it's not necessarilywhether or not it's directed at someoneexternal in both cases anger in andanger out can be directed at someoneexternal it's a question of whether ornot it's expressed outwardly orcontained inside beautifully statedbeautifully stated so we C you knowanger depression anxiety uh we capturefatigue sleep and so what we try to dois again look at the whole personbecause they're not just a back ifthat's where they're having pain or notjust a neck or a shoulder in your caseit's impacting the whole person and wejust got done talking earlier about howall of these circuits interact with eachother and so sometimes we can't justeliminate the no susception in theperiphery sometimes we can reduce it butwhat we have to do is Target everythingand we have to try to Target all thesecircuits up here and in many cases whatwe're doing is through education throughpainpsychology um through physical therapyand re rehabilitative approaches on topof it and yes the medications we havenow you know we touched Bas on a fewearlier but we have over 200 medicationsavailable for pain um very few of themFDA approveduh we tend to steal from all the otherfields so you're talking about more than200 medications that can be yesprescribed for pain but as off Laeltreatments perfectly stated yeah there'sonly a few medications that are actuallyFDA approved specifically for pain sowhat we what we do is we borrow or stealfrom the psychiatrists some of their uhtheiranti-depressants uh which willfrequently work very effectively forpain and work on those pain relatedcircuits in thebrain we uh take from the neurologistsome of the anti-seizure medicationsbecause thosemedications um while reducing separatelyseizures for people who don't haveseizures they work on ION channels umthey work on other neuromodulators thatalso are involved in pain circuitry wecan take from the cardiologistmedications that work on the heart anti-arhythmia or heart rhythm drugs they arepotent sodium channel blockers and thesodium channels as you know areresponsible for the action potentialthat generates the nerve impulse signaland so they're like an oral localanesthetic that you take and so we we wetake from everybody in our field in themedications getting back to to what yousaidso just summarizing one I I don't reallydistinguishuh psychological versus physical pain inmy world I I find it better just totreat it as pain and look at the personholistically and go after all thecomponents at once I find that's wherewe get the bestresults and it is typically bringing alot of tools to Bear speaking of toolsto Bear What role if any does nutrition"

of foods that aretriggersum and an incredibly underappreciatedareaum you know I've had my experiences withchronic pain umI developed uh an abdominal chronic painproblem uh shortly after I turned 50 Iwas throwing a happy hour for our painpsychologists of all people went to aMexican restaurant I won't name whichone got food poisoning That's why I'mnot naming it good Mexican food bad foodpoisoning and ever since that event Ican't eat anything in the onion familywhat um I'm familiar with with onionsbut what else is in the onion family I'msure you've researched this now prettythoroughly considering what you'redescribing classic and the what we referto as fod Maps you know it's one of thefod maps and I have now some issues withthe others and um manifested by justsevere severe up abdominal pain and umnot many other symptoms but you know itput me on this journey where uh severeabdominal pain didn't know why couldn'tsleepcouldn't sleep went like I'd go monthswithout having a restful night's sleep Ithought I was getting early Alzheimer'sbecause I felt like I was gettingstupid and um what actually benefited mewas of all things the pandemic whybecause what did we all do we isolatedwe started eating the same foods and Istarted noticing I was feeling betterwhen I was eating certain foods myabdominal pain went away and I'd startdoing as a scientistexperiments and I finally was was ableto isolate and determine what theproblemwas so now I have complete avoidance onthat I'm I'm a little difficult to goout to a restaurant and have dinner butyou know so no onions no onions and whatelse shallots chives scallions leaksanything in the onion family you knownot alium I'm fine withgarlicand you know by healthy eating byidentifying something by triggerschanged my lifeand return to a degree of normaly Ithink the key for people is you know ifyou have any kind of similar issuesidentify thosetriggers sometimes uh isolation of youknow Foods or restrictions and using ajournal and then as you learn from thatslowly build Foods back into your diet Ithink it's so important for people tohear this and thanks for sharing yourpersonal story around this because Ithink that nutrition while everyphysician seems to appreciate that thequality of nutrition matters definingwhat quality nutrition is is reallydifficult there's still you know Avideven we could call them ranous debatesabout this you know vegan versusomnivore versus this and you know but itsounds like this is a case where it canbecome very individualized but I couldimagine somebody going to theirphysician and that physician not beingyou and saying yeah you know I noticethat when I eat certain foods I'm in alot of pain and the physician simplysaying well don't eat those foods butunless that person is a trainedscientist like not knowing how to goabout doing the sorts of experimentsthat you did would be difficultimpossible I'm sorry I know I interruptyou I just want to build on that if I ifI can one of the key things I simplifiedmy story but the key thing is is if I ifI eat onions or anything that onionfamily it's pain for two weeks wow it isso the thing isis if you get repeated Expos exposuresit never stops and it gets very veryhard to figure out what it was so it'snot like you eat something you get painit goes away where you know we can alldo that pattern recognition here youhave to be able to think back whathappened two weeks ago that may haveinfluenced it so it's not easy well thismay be a case for elimination dietswhich are uh provide they're done safelywhere people restrict the number offoods they eat to a very limited numberof foods make sure they still get enoughcalories and macronutrients uh that theyneed protein fats and carbohydrates orwhat what have you but that by limitingthe total number of foods that they eatto like eight or 10 basic things thenyou can build things in and then explorewhat triggers the pain or what removesthe pain I don't really see any otherway I am intrigued by The Onion exampleeven though it's a it's a it's your casein particular and we don't want toextrapolate too broadly is theresomething about onions that's triggeringa particular neurochemical or immunepathwaydo we have any knowledge of like whyonions would create that kind of gutpain this has been a journey I've beenon now for a few years to answer this umuh one of our GI pain docks that we havecome in the Clin lyen newwin sent me apaper from I know Sellar nature thatshowed that after a gutinfection it can change the geneticexpression related to sensitizing you tofood antigens I know I throw out a lotof jargon there basically the shortanswer is you get an infection and yourgut no longerresponds properly to a normal fooditem and so one explanation may be I gotthis infection I was at a Mexicanrestaurant a lot of onions and I gotsensitized through that infection nowsubsequently to onions you know I saw aStanford uh allergist Hannah Watfordwho's awesome by the way and uh after Ihad this I think figured out and I wentin and I'm like well you know Dr Watfordis there anything I can do for this andshe laughed and she's like no you'redoing everything it's all justavoidance and I thinking I was ratherunique and special about this thing Isaid you know do you ever see this andshe said oh yeah I see this all the timeevery day I see this all the time and Isaid like this isn't unusual he's likeno I see this thing all the time andthis thing meaning sensitivity stivityto certain know to certain to differentthese different food groups and thisthis thing that occurs later in lifesomething an event that happens tosomebody thattriggers and I said well gosh thatsounds like a public health problem andshe's like that's what we're debatingright now in the allergy Community iswhether this is representing more of apublic health issue and is because I'mseeing I Dr Watford I'm seeingincreasing amounts of this uh as we goforward how interesting well um this isnot a time to plug the philanthropic armof our premium podcast but uh I'm veryinvolved in science philanthropy thissounds like an area to De devote somefunding to to explore how foods areimpacting the local and systemic painresponse yeah I I got in you know so I'mrunning a large biomarker study tocharacterize people deeply and one ofthe things that I wanted to put in thereis microbiome characterization now to beclear that's out of my wheelhouse butthe beauty of being at Stanford andother major institutions is you can gomake friends yeah Justin sonenberg who'sbeen a guest on this podcast is one ofthe world experts on the gut microbiomewe have a few others too so there you goso he's a friendly guy I'm sure he'llcollaborate we go we go make friends andpeople who understand the microbiome wecollect the samples and that's whereteam science is magical and once againthe idea looking at the wholeperson as long as we're talking aboutthe gut um let's talk about pain inside"

            "text": "describing an example of referenced painso my understanding of referenced painis that you know like for instance II've got a slight bulge at I think likemy lumbar 34 disc or something I had awhole body scan recently just a um anexploration scan cuz I had theopportunity not not anything seriousfortunately and there's a slightly bulgdisc there and every once in a while ifI do certain movements um in the gymI'll get pain down in my right hip andsometimes going down my leg and I usedto think it was sciatica cuz you assumeanything on the right back side okaymust be wallet induced s sciatica backpocket wallet into sciatica um but whatI eventually realized is that well it'sthis dis buul it just so happens thatthe nerves that emit from that thatregion um they Branch out to a bunch ofdifferent areas and so you think thepain is in your leg but the the issue issomeplace else or um and occasionallyindeed I feel the pain elsewhere in mybody as well it's sort of like a like amatching of regions for pain that seemunrelated is that a way to think aboutreference pain perfectly the the theexamples also I referred to of a heartattack causing referred pain or also thepelvic region associated with back painas a way of um referred pain um whatyou're describing is the fact that paindoesn't have to start with an injury ora stimulus in the periphery you coulddamage the nerves anywhere along the wayand that will be perceived as pain werefer to that as neuropathic pain sothat's another distinction you broughtup uh nicely good good segue intothere's thought to be um severaldifferent types or categories of pain wehave been talking through much of thistime about somatic pain you know injuryout here we talked about visceral painand when you have damage to a peripheralnerve damage injury to a peripheralnerve or the central nervous system werefer to that as neuropathic painit frequently has different qualitiesdifferent characteristics people willrefer to it as shooting stabbing shocklikeburning it can frequently uh whenthere's a damage to a nerve or damage tocertain regions of the brain beincredibly challenging totreat by the way the good news is withthat uh light disc bulge is the vastmajority of time the discs reabsorb yeahI have to be careful to not do too muchumspinal flexion like sit-ups and stuff Ithought that that would help but thatactually doesn't strengthen the back itwas actually a asymmetry between theabdominal muscles and the lower backmuscles so provided I do a lot of backextension type training then that bulgemore or less stays in I just have to bea little little cautious not toocautious fortunately as long as we'retalking about referenced pain somaticvisceral and all the rest what aboutassociative or referenced pain whereit's psychological and I don't want toget too abstract here but more and morethese days I hear from people who sayyou know I was in this job and the jobsucked or I was in this relationship andthe relationship sucked and I hadterrible back pain like really acutelocalized back pain or chronic headachesor migraines yeah and then they go onvacation or they change theircircumstances and lo and behold the paingoes away does that surprise you as anexpert in pain not at all not at allwhat you're you know simp simplisticallyreferring to is you know there's peopleare undergoingstress and wehave we clearly know that the brain isnot a passive recipient of informationcoming in from the body it's a two-waystreet the brain is causing Downstreamconsequences in the body the brain uhcontrols our sympathetic nervous systemand parasympathetic nervous system thesympathetic being the fight andlightresponse it controls the tone of uhcortisol that's being released and weall know that in acutesituations rapid increases of cortisoland um nor adrenaline is keeps us awayfrom the Lions and the Tigers and thebears oh my but in a chronic situationand uh Robert spolski as you know atStanford has built a career aroundchronic stress at least in part and verybad for us and so these chronicstressors impact the end organ thetissue and it's real pain it doesn'tmean that we need to go get backsurgery it means that probably we needto identify the stressors that arecontributing to that and address thoseand we'll often find that in thescenarios you outline that the pain getsbetter um some of those targets areinteresting um there's a lot of memoryassociated with pain this is where earlylife eventsoccur and those early life events andinjuries can sensitize us to Futurevulnerability so I was in a car act badcar accident when I was16 uh fortunate to walk away from it gotbad whiplashif I get stressed a lot of my painmanifests in myneck for me as a pain do it's a signalto me that'slike go work out go for a walk in theforest you know uh and take some timeaway from thecomputer again that's a simplisticmessage and my experience doesn'ttranslate into everybody else but I'mjust

real physiological levels as youmentioned earlier psychological isphysiological and vice versa it's hardto separate the two but could you sharewith us uh what you did in that studyand what you found because I find itreally interesting and it also points tothe incredible power of love in uh howweexperience life yeah yeah I thinkthere's several cool things about thatstudy that I love to share one is how itall came about so um you know usNeuroscience Geeks often go to thesociety for Neuroscience as an annualmeeting and I was hanging out and uhsharing a room with art Aaron whostudies passionate love and he and hiswife study passionate love and we werehaving a glass or two of wine and I'masking art have you ever you know haveyou ever studied pain he's like no Istudy love and he's like have you everstudied love no I study pain if hasanybody ever studied the intersectionanother glass of wine no let's do it sowe came back to Stanford and there was ayoung postto Jared younger who's now aprofessor at the University of Alabamaand I said Jared we were either going tofall flat in her face or we're going tothis is going to be a cool study andJared took this on great job so what wedid is we advertised on campus forcouples in an early phase of a romanticrelationshipbecause there's a reason for choosingthat in an early phase of a romanticrelationship you are deeply focused onyour beloved they're on your mind allthe time you feel great when you're withthem you feel terrible when you're notwith them doesn't that just sound likeanaddiction I mean it's that yearning uh Idon't know that's it's a can be apleasant experience but addictions youknow for the people who are using thesubstance can find it you know in thatearly phase very pleasant but it itturns out that the early phase of aromantic relationship engages the sameneural circuitries as addictioninteresting same reward circuitry allthat so we chose that and so he saidcome to us and bring pictures of yourbeloved and bring pictures of an equallyattractive acquaintance clothed thisisn't sex that we're studying uhclothed and we caused them pain in thescanner and and and we paid themafterwards um weneeded a control condition for thisbecause thinking about yourbeloved is very uh attentionallydemanding remember we talked aboutattentional distraction earlier so wegave people what's called a wordgenerationtask very simply um can you think aboutevery sport that doesn't involve aball okay uh frisbee hockey boxingboxing okay that's attentionallydemanding think about every vegetablethat's not green and you know so you'rerunning that through your head and we'recausing you pain it's an intentionaldistraction taskso we flash people pictures of theirbeloved cause pain flash people of theiracquaintance cause pain and thendistraction okay what did we find loveworks great love works great it was awonderful analgesic it significantlyreduced people'spain and it turned out the more in loveyou were the more pain relief you gotwhen viewing the photo of the person youlove yes when View doing the photo ofthe person you love now how did we knowhow much in love they were it turns outthe psychologists have got scales foreverything and one of them is apassionate love scale which asks howwhat percentage of the day are youpreoccupied thinking about your belovedoh goodness you just sent people now offto give their Partners the passionatelove scale to figure out how much timethey're spending thinking about themyeah we we had Stanford students some ofthem thinking about their beloved 80% ofthe day uh I wanted to use this as ascreening tool for our residentapplicants because uh I I I want themfocusing on patients not their belovedand that is by the way a joke that badjoke but but probably is real worldwe're not just talking about Stanford Imean but when somebody's writing you ascript or a prescription that is orgiving you advice um yeah you might wantto know if they are in a new romanticrelationship yeah so the the the other Ithought the other uh cool thing aboutthis study was attention worked also butattentionand love worked on differentcircuits so attentional distraction theyworked equally well attention againworked on some of these prefrontalregions these outer corticalareas love worked on more of what weclassically think of is thesereward-based circuits the nucleusaccumbens uh the amydalaum one of the the descending uh brainstem regions called the substantiawhich is coming down from the brainthrough that area to the spinal cord toinhibit pain so classic addictionPathways classic and so the key againmessage for people is um different whatwe would think of as psychologicalapproaches engaging different braincircuits to reducepain I'll leave you with one last uhside note that we didn't publish on andthat is uh Jared went back a year laterand we assessed the student strength oftheir relationship if assuming it wasstill ongoing and he found that therewas a rather High correlation betweenthe love induced analgesia and brainactivity and the cadate nucleus and inthe insular with the strength of theirrelationship a year later it was so wehad a brain scan that was a predictor afuture um strength of a relationshipcould you tell us the direction of thoseresults so if a new romantic partnershipis uh creating high levels of activityin these two brain areas you justmentioned then it is a very goodpredictor that the relationship will yessurvive over time well in this limitedsample it meant that it it was going tobe very strong a year later umunderstand and you know Andrew we alwayshave to put these caveats unpublishednon-peer reviewed it was a fun post Hawdata analysis that I'm not sure ifanybody's ever you know run with thosekind of things no but we can explore itin a in a playful way now and people cando with it what they will it does sortof speak to something important thoughum assuming that result would hold up ifthe same experiment were done and youknow many hundreds or thousands ofpeople it sort of speaks to the ideathat the activation of these addictionlikee circuits in the early phase of apassionate loverelationship set in motiona certain number of things that createstability in that relationship which onthe face of it um makes sense but we'vealso all heard of the opposite way ofwell as well which is you know um FoolsRush In or that uh things that startfast end fast or things like that buthere you're talking about um the earlyphase of passion serving thisinteresting role in terms of analgesiauh alleviating pain but also predictingsome stability of the relationship overtime it's kind of interesting it'sfascinating to talk about uh you know Ifeel like I have to put that caveat inthat not generalized but a fun thing totalk about and it's where I think coolscientific ideas can come from forfuture exploration that I think that'salso what's pretty neatum I find the um you know again thedifferent circuits for differentapproaches to reducing pain fascinatingagain that gets to the question youasked me earlier is there one circuitand the answer is no what we have to dois figure out what is the best circuitfor a particular person or set ofcircuits if you're willing I'd like totalk about"

examples of that that we hear aboutand those are very Salient and verydisturbing verysaddening so I think that most peopleincluding myself hear the opioid crisisand assume that what we really should bedoing is Seeking a better alternativebut what I'm hearing from you is thatthere are use cases where opioids make agreat deal of sense and that they'vereally helped improve people's lives andthat none of what I just described oranything like it is experienced by thosepeople in fact quite the opposite do Ihave that right perfectly and and that'sagainwhere we we we need to treat these at anindividual level on a case-by Case basisum and that one size doesn't fit all umyes opioids wereoverprescribed I think everybody agreesto that in thiscountry um and we went through a periodof time with massive overprescribing andthere's a lot of nuance and reasons whyin large part um Physicians we getterrible education around pain and wedon't know how to treat it in generalcoming out of medical school we getabout 7 hours of education on pain uhveterinarians get 40 it's great ifyou're taking I think your dog's name isCastello yeah unfortunately he passedbut he took some pain meds for a

understood because he startedmoving better and feeling better andsleeping better and I expected the vetercommunity to come after me withpitchforks not one wow did that and yetI heard from hundreds of veterinariansthat said yes we wish that we couldprescribe those sorts of things topeople who castrate their male dogslater in life to humiliate theirsymptoms um so that opened up to me awhole world of

great well theVets hopefully are healthy too you getthe point yeah but when it comes to theopioid crisis in this discussion youknow I think it's become so Laden withthe idea that like doctors are on thetake like they're getting paid to giveopioids to patients and that's whythey're doing that and and I don'tbelieve that necessarily be the case butI think that's what the publicperception is that

anaddiction medicine uh psychologist andpublic policy person and the way hebreaks it down and I subscribe to thisis you know the there's three types ofPhysicians remember there's about amillion physicians in this country aboutamillion um you've got Physicians doingthe right thing for the right reasonsvast majority ofdocs we need to leave them alone we needto support them we need to help them dotheir job and not put more obstructionsin their way there is a much smallergroup of docs doing the wrong thing forthe right reasons what I mean by that isthese are docs who did overprescribeopioids in this case in thiscontext they um did buy into themarketing messages that were put forwardthey did not have much education aroundAlternatives in treatingpain and they thought by handing outpills just pills uh in their very briefvisits with patients remember PrimaryCare dox as my heart goes out to themyou know what do they get 14 minutes orso with a patient they gave themsomething that they thought would helpthey were doing the the wrong thing forthe right reasons but they believed thatthey were helping they didn't have theyweren't get catching Financialincentives or okay got it that's rightthose people we need to educate them weneed to train them on proper painmanagement opioid prescribingdeprescribing and then you've got thetiny little group at the top of this ifyou will pyramid these are um docksdoing the wrong thing for the wrongreasons these are bad docks these areyour pill Mills the these are peoplebreaking the law they need to go to jailend of um the thing is is that thatlittle group at the top in the millionor so Physicians we have in this countryit represents such a smallrepresentation but it got blown out bythe media and everybody elseparticularly those docs doing the rightthing for the right reasons got caughtup in it and engendered huge amount offear huge amount of fear on thephysician side and then what happened isthe docs just started abandoningpatients they cut their patientsoff um I had a young housewife two youngkids uh doc Cut Her Off from a littlebit of vicadin that she was takenintermittently for um um some back painthat had been well managed on this shewas doing all the right things cut heroff she turned to black tar heroin youknow um California great state ofCalifornia tried an experiment wherethey monitor death certificates in ourstate for and the docs prescribingopioids for that and uh they went afterthe docs thinking that if they targetedthe docs doing that it would lead to areduce a reduction in opioid deaths itled to a doubling I knowcounterintuitive because what happenedis the docs abandon thepatients and so we have to be aware ofthe negative consequences of this nowthe current I'm not trying to minimizethe opioid crisis because it's real butwe also now need to put some context theopioid crisis is beingdriven by the illicitfenel it is more if you just look at theCDC data it's very clear that the fenelcoming in Via Mexico China and others uhis what driving most of thedeaths um Keith um getting back to Keithled a beautifuluh Lance at Stanford Commission on theNorth American opioid crisis and puttogether a very rational plan I justfinished serving as a senior adviser tothe medical board of California where werevised our prescribing guidelineshere they were very Draconian beforehardlimits made people fearful both patientsand docs and we've shifted it back overto put the control back in the hands ofthe physician patientrelationship uh we're hoping it'll makeadifference

searchthat it's available over the counter andthat certain people like to take itoften like every day at low doses oreven higher Doses and that there washuge variation in terms of the amount ofkatom in the various products and howmuch people were taking some peopletalking about katom as something was asif it were innocuous and we can askwhether or not indeed it is innocuousand so I put out a a tweet I guess nowthat it Twitter is called X I guess Iput out an X anyway doesn't matter and Iand I said that my um first pass view ofthe literature on katum the scientificliterature is that you know it had a lotof property similar to opioids althoughdifferent as well and that it seemedkind of odd and maybe even problematicthat it was so widely available and Igotbombarded with um I don't want to callthem katum enthusiasts because what Isoon discovered was that these people umwere angry with me for um placing even apartial Shadow on katum but what wasinteresting to me was that they weresaying that in their case and I'massuming they were telling the truththat katum had helped them get offprescription opioids and that theyheavily rely on katum in various dolevels of dosage um in ways that theyfelt really help them and so two thingshappen one I've been put in thecrosshairs of the pro Crum Community notnot to a a severe extent but perhaps themore important thing is and I want tothank that Community uh in part for youknow now it's inspired me to do a deepdive search on katum I'm going to beinterviewing one of the Laboratoriesthat's done a lot of the research onkatum later in uh 2024 but also it it'smade me realize like there are thesecompounds that are available over thecounter that many people feel feel sopassionately about because they reallyfeel like it's helped them I'm notsaying it has I'm not saying it hasn'tbut then again I've never taken it whatis katum at or perhaps what receptorsdoes it tickle and what are yourthoughts about katum and people usingkatum and maybe I'm pronouncing it wrongI've also heard Crome I'm calling itkatum yeah uh katum is this naturalsubstance that does have as you saidopiod deric um properties as well asothers that is not fully understood it'sbeen available well naturally for manymany years brought in to the UnitedStates and I've heard the same storiesand I just want you to be prepared thatanything I say about katum there's goingto be some angry people after this andit is what it isum I have heard the same stories thatyou have heard about people taking katumand saying it's helping them to stay offof uh prescription opioids or elicitopioids and and I get that I think insome way it's binding opioid receptorsand reducing the uh natural craving forthese other substances and it makesperfect sense a methadone does thatbuprenorphine which I didn't mentionbefore but is a is an interesting opioidthat U binds to these receptors and itreducescravingum where I have challenges is in uh justbecause something is natural doesn'tmean that it is safe we are seeing anincreased number of Overdose deathsassociated withkatum um is it poly substance yeah insome cases it is but I think there's alot we don't know so so poly substancepeople taking katum but also alcohol uhbenzos getting back to thebenzosum personaluh I think we need to put a lot ofresearch into this agent and if itmerits it I think it should be a uh aprescribed substance I think part of thechallenge that we have is that we don'tunderstand the quality the Purity thedose that people are taking of thisthing uh you know similar type of storywith cannabis by the way uhso I'm hoping that we're going to getthe research that we need to reallyunderstand what it's doing and whetherit is safeand effective I'm left with a lot ofunknowns rightnow you mentioned cannabis is cannabiseffective and by extension is CBDeffective for managing pain yeah there'sanother controversial one you'll get afew comments about whatever I say youknow in general listeners of thispodcast yes they tell us where they'reupset they'll also tell us where theyagree um our goal here is never to umsatisfy everybody but just to you knowsome of this lands in the in the realmof Highly Educated opinion um some of itis still as you pointed out speculationbecause we don't really know what Crumsources people are taking or cannabisEtc but um I think you'll find and myexperience has been that um peopleappreciate that we're having theconversation and we do read all thecomments and those comments often as Imentioned in my earlier anecdote aboutthat tweet um often direct us to explorethings further and we can always have ayou know second discussion about thisdown the line so we invite all yourcomments and criticism cannabiswell here's what we know in carefullycontrolled laboratory situationscannabis has been shown to reduceneuropathic pain that's that nerverelated pain from people who have eithernerve injury uh diabetic neuropathy uhpostoptic neuralgia terrible burningnerve pain condition it has been shownto reducethat in smallsamples from larger scale epidemiologystudies and even larger like Clinicbased studies that I've done we find ithas not been particularly helpful onaverage compared to people not on uhcannabis there's a lot we don't knowabout the causality of that and thedirection of it but all to say thatthere are um many many questions thatremainum I think the challenge that Ipersonally have is that we're runninghuge population level experiments as wespeak right now by you know providingunfettered use ofcannabis and the bad news is is thatwe're probably going to see some realuntour consequences of it and we'realready are um the good news is I'mhoping that at a state level we'll beable to use that data to reallyinform um what's going on with cannabisI mean some of the challenges are what Ireferred to with catom uh cannabis isnot cannabis is not cannabis you the THCto CBD ratios the dose yes all of thatwe don't know what you're getting itremains a scheduled One Drug by the DEAum I uh in some of my leadership rolesand others have called for scheduling ofit as a schedule to why why not topurpose try to restrict use but bymaking it a schedule to drug you've nowmade it so much easier toresearch uh I don't know if peopleunderstand how many barriers there areto scientists studying schedule onedrugs could you explain schedule oneversus schedule two thank you yeah soschedule the scheduling of drugs is acategorization that describes theirabuseliability and so you have drugs like PCPheroin um cannabis which are scheduleone which are defined as having highaddiction potential and no uh utilitywhich is just wild because when I thinkabout PCP Fen cycline I certainly don'twant people to run out and start takingPCP but chemically and physiologicallyPCP is ever so similar toketamine and you know rarely is thisdiscussed but ketamine is now uh widelyused as a therapeutic presumablyketamine isn't schedule two um maybeeven schedule three yes and so some ofthe the the stuff that's thrown intoschedule one makes no sense it'shistorical it's all his it's decades anddecades ago of history and clearlycannabis should not be a schedule onehands down noquestion uh by scheduling it though youwill have the societal benefit of beingable to make it more easy to studyand then you get the NIH and the FDAinto this and we can start reallygetting answers to the questions which Ido I think it works at the end of theday do I think there is somevariation of cannabis THC CBD ratiosthat will provide some benefit ohabsolutely there's too many receptors inour brain that are involved withmodulation of pain I just don't knowwhat those are um a friend of mine uh uhMark Wallace uh runs pain at UC SanDiego has come up with a really nicerecipe cocktail of ratios of THC to CBDthat he feels very strongly that he canhelp people um using that as an activeagent yeah I know that in uh Coloradothere's a strain of cannabis where theyit's pure CBD no THC I think they callit Charlotte's Web and parents ofchildren with intractable epilepsy willactually move to the state of Coloradoin order to get it because it seems tobe effective for the treatment ofcertain forms of pediatric epilepsy thatwas shared with me with one of ourcolleagues Nolan Williams when he was aguest on the podcast so theseplant-based compounds have have theirplace whether or not it's katum perhapsright we're remaining open about that orcannabis the T the THC or the CBD orsome combination I think it's reallyinteresting I think as long as we'retalking about plant compounds how do you"
