            "text": "this is a long time coming we're colleagues at Stanford and I'm familiar with your work but today we're going to take a pretty Broad and deep survey of this thing called pain so I'll just start off very simply and ask what is pain pain is this complex and subjective experience that serves a crucial role for all of us to keep us away from injury or harm it is both a sensory and an emotional experience and I think that gets lost on people that includes this emotional component to it and it is incredibly individual and we'll get more into that hopefully as time goes by that you know your pain is different from my pain and is different from everybody else's it takes an incredible toll on society when it goes chronic when it becomes persistent to the tune of about a 100 million Americans and at last count about a half a trillion dollars a year in medical expenses uh so an astounding problem we're facing in society and one that's only getting worse and I'm hoping during the course of this discussion that we can kind of break down a little bit of the foundation of pain and kind of build it back up because unfortunately uh in society there's a lot of misunderstanding about what pain is and I think uh hopefully we can build that foundation and then layer on some some useful treatments and useful options for people I'm glad you pointed out this link between the sensory and the emotional experience every once in a while I'll pull something or I'll have like you know like a kink in my neck or my back and fortunately for me it resolves pretty quickly but I notice that when I'm experiencing that kind of pain that I become slightly more irritable perhaps much more irritable depending on who you ask and that everything becomes more challenging thinking is harder sleeping is harder concentrating on anything besides pain it's it's a um it's as if something's nagging from the inside and so that raises the the next question that I have which is is pain something that's in our brain in our body or both it's clearly in our brain and can I take a moment to kind of lay a little foundation for some of that to help clear up some of the mystery of pain we know that pain most pain all starts with some stimulus whether it be that kink in your neck or your shoulder from working out or turning the wrong way and what's going on there uh in your body is not pain what's going on is that uh there are sensors in our skin our soft tissue our deep tissues called noors and these noors are sensing elements and they sense different types of stimuli they can sense temperature uh heat cold they sense pressure they can sense pH changes due to for instance inflammation that may occur from uh any something going on in your neck or your shoulder those signals up nerve fiber types and the two that we we refer to are a Delta and C fibers one transmits very fast it's responsible that you know sharp jolt of pain that goes to your brain when we uh you know step on a tack or put our hand on a hot stove and there's another fiber called a CA fiber which is much slower and responsible for that dull achy pain now these signals they go to the spinal cord lie up and down our uh from our head down to our back and they're they're shaped they're changed a little bit they then are sent up to the brain and it's once they hit the brain and they converge with this Magical Mystery set of nerves in the brain that it becomes the experience of pain and if there's one key message I'd like to get to the audience is that what goes on out here what goes on in your shoulder in your neck is not pain that's no susception those are electrical signals electrochemical impulses being transmitted and that is to be distinguished from what becomes the subjective experience of pain that you have and why it's critical is that our brain serves so many functions of emotions cognitions uh memory action all of that shapes those signals coming in from our body to create your unique experience of pain that's different from everybody else's and I think that's important to note because we are frequently left with this notion of this onetoone concordance between the stimulus and the experience of pain you know Renee Dart that French uh philosopher I think 17th century um was the one who first postulated this idea of this direct linkage between the body and our actions and the stimulus and the response and it's wrong and unfortunately even in medical care we have this biomedical model that still is perpetuating this idea of a onetoone relationship and that's a critically important point to get across in large part because frequently as humans we tend to project onto others our own experiences of pain and when we see somebody who's got an injury or something else going on we immediately put that on them and that has also been a problem uh with many people suffering in chronic pain which is often viewed as the invisible disease so when you say we put that on them you mean when somebody reports being in pain we have a hard time understanding what they're are experiencing because it's going to be very different than the way that we experience pain conversely if somebody's in pain they tend to assume that people are experiencing pain the way that they are do I have that right you have it perfectly right and it actually if I can build on that gets worse because sometimes you have conditions like fibromyalgia that maybe we'll get into where outwardly visibly you don't see anything wrong we're used to thinking of pain as a fractured you know bone as a swollen ankle we see that and then we like okay well you've got pain you got legitimate pain whereas this invisible disease of chronic pain frequently you don't have something outwardly that you're seeing but we bring in our own history of pain and we put that on other people I have a question that's somewhat mechanistic but we'll keep it accessible "

            "text": "painkiller let let's take a uh typical over-the-counter painkiller like a ibuprofen or camenen to uh lessen pain of some kind yeah where is that drug or drugs acting is it in the body or is it at the level of the brain or both yeah and this is where some of the challenges we get into with language because technically nids nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs like ibuprofen like Naperson they're actually not analgesics they're not technically pain killers so an analgesic is the descriptor for a quote unquote painkiller yeah there that would be more correct like an opioid would be would fit into that category the N heads are anti-inflammatory drugs they're also there's another this is a technical term they're anti-hyperalgesic drugs and so one of the things that happens after an injury is that we get sensitization of the area that's injured and it's a beautiful thing because it sends a message to us to protect it um what the end heads do is they reduce some of that sensitization out in the periphery and then back in the spinal cord and in the brain but they don't actually so for instance I was going to say try this at home but probably not you can um in a normal situation you know hit your hand with a fork measure the amount of pain I'll go take an NSAID like ibuprofen if you hit your hand with that same Fork there'll be no difference folks please don't do that don't do that at home please yeah or any or anywhere for that matter or anywhere for that matter but you're describing pain and the local inflammation response and the hyper Alesia the increase in pain in that general area as something very adaptive very important so it raises the question what is the threshold for saying that somebody should treat their pain reduce their pain I mean you know anytime I've done um you know surgeries on animals which I don't do anymore in the laboratory but we used to you know you would give them painkillers post-operatively I've had iies before I had painkillers postoperatively although I don't like taking them I don't like the way they make my brain feel and so uh but we of course know that if you increase the dose of any pain medication too much then that animal or a human can potentially injure themselves worse or not protect that injured area so it raises a whole set of sort of medical ethical but also just purely biological questions how do you set the threshold for yes blunt pain versus no allow the pain to be there as an adaptive way of protecting yourself in healing presumably the inflammation is part of the healing process too and as you mentioned before pain is so subjective and it's different between all of us I mean how do we decide uh whether or not it's a good or bad idea to blunt that pain yeah I think the the the threshold is when it's impacting your quality of life and your ability to take care of activities at daily living engage with family friends go to work and that that s kind of a your your threshold for you know whether it's reasonable to to take a medication or not it's a lot of controversy in the space right now it used to be we all recommended just Neds for any type of acute injury I is non-steroid anti-inflammatory drugs indeed could could we maybe list off a few of those so I mentioned ibuprofen aceto Menin so sometimes referred to as you know the classic Advil Tylenol we won't throw out name brands there but what are some others Naproxin neoen is another one Toral or ketorolac is another one the two over-the-counter nids the prototypical over-the-counter ones are ibuprofen and napasin those are the ones you can buy over the counter without a prescription uh Tylenol actually has a slightly different mechanism of injury but you know still fits in that same general class it tends to be more centrally acting IBU uh Tylenol or camenen but take we say centrally you mean Brain Brain Brain thank you than you and uh is aspirin considered an insat I don't believe as would fit into that category of basically a Cox cyc oxygenase inhibitor this is one of the the chemical mediators that gets released during injury and that chemical uh substance has a tendency to wind up or amplify the noors so that after an injury you note that you're more sensitive there after a sunburn you end up having more sensitization that is what we refer to as peripheral sensitization because it's out in the periphery we're winding up or amplifying the response uh aspirin n heads in general will reduce that inflammation they're anti- um hyperalgesic and uh pardon again the jargony terms that we use but hope coming across along as we go but but you know to your point you don't want to for instance let's imagine you have a fractured ankle you don't want to be reaching for a very potent opioid just so that you can continue walking on a fractured ankle that you haven't gotten evaluated by a clinician and perhaps casted that wouldn't be safe those are rather extreme examples you know we get into those debates right in professional sports where you know they they send the person back out on the field with a broken bone you know having given them an ejection or something I'm I'm hoping that doesn't go on anymore but uh I'm sure it goes on okay yeah well there's all sorts of other things I get contacted all the time professional teams and athletes asking how they can get back in quicker nowadays the big thing are these uh peptides that can certainly accelerate healing people are traveling out of country get stem cell injections all with all with uh very few randomized control trials but I assure you that um Courtside and in the locker room mainly in the locker room their corticosteroid injections their painkiller injections I mean it's it's not at any expense but it's not far from that okay yeah yeah well you know when you're you're making millions of dollars a year and I I get the being back on the field but for the rest of us mere mortals um I think that's where we would want to draw a line get medical attention if you've got an acute injury going a little bit deeper into mechanism "

            "text": "because I think it's going to serve us well now and going forward you mentioned the IDS and um this uh Cox Cox is one of it's a is it in the family of PR gland can we talk about prandin because I think there are a lot of people nowadays we hear about inflammation yeah you know inflammation's bad inflammation's bad but you know one of the things that we talk about a lot on this podcast is the fact that you know cortisol isn't bad inflammation isn't bad these things serve an important biological role so the prostaglandins seem to be one of the main ways that our immune system uh responds to a physical or chemical injury and and creates inflammation and that as you said that inflammation sensitizes an area makes it literally more sensitive and then we introduce these drugs that um to restore normal functioning and living could we establish like what normal functioning is I mean for instance if we make this really concrete could we say well if you can sleep fall asleep at night and stay asleep or perhaps go back to sleep after you've woken up in the middle of the night then will you heal during sleep and so you know take as little painkiller as possible but enough that still still lets you sleep well at night is that it's sort of normal functioning because when I have a kink in my neck I don't want to do much of anything I try but it's really frustrating so what is I mean as a physician how and as a patient how do we determine normal functioning yeah and you're getting into the Nuance the complexity of this problem because we've been talking about NSAIDs the IB prence and napins and as I said early on we used to just give these out all the time but then the research comes out and shows that by blocking inflammation by blocking that we may be blocking the normal healing process and so we've seen delays in fracture repair we've been seeing delays in tissue repair and so now you've got on one hand a medication that may help with pain help you improve function you've got on the other hand something you're taking that may delay the process where do you draw the line as a physician my Approach is really basically what you said it's balancing the fact that if you're not sleeping at night you're not going to heal and you're not going to be able to do what you need to do the next day and if taking an inset helps you sleep and helps you uh engage with what you need to do take it at the lowest dose that you can get away with I've heard before that NAD should be taken no more than once every six hours people will alternate different types of ins that's usually try reduce fever another situation where an Adaptive response fever you know people go out of their way to block it right prevent the brain from cooking but again opens up the same set of issues and so I'm wondering if somebody has some pain that makes you know moving about frustrating and it's and it's difficult but you know they can sleep at night reasonably well maybe not as well as they normally do would your suggestion to that person if their goal is to heal as quickly as possible to just not take anything yeah so we've got a lot more data on the benefits of nids this class of medication reducing pain then we have data uh showing the bad consequences of it and so we're still needing more data on the whole healing message I think that a lot of the orthopedic surgeons out there prefer people not to be on IDs after for instance a total hip replacement at total knee replacement because I think that's pretty clear but that's not what we're talking about right now so so one of the other interesting things about n heads like we mentioned ibuprofin and aprin huge individual variability around those so personally ibuprofen is not very effective for me napasin is for others it may be just exactly the opposite so there's value in rotating them and finding out which works best for your particular situation you mentioned the timing of it ibuprofen is typically given no more than three times a a day it's got a short halflife Naperson twice a day what's critical I need to give this message is in both situations make sure that you have food in your stomach make sure you're not taking it on an empty stomach make sure you're drinking plenty of fluids and if you've got any um GI issues if you've got any bleeding issues if you've got kidney issues if you've got heart issues talk to your doc talk to your clinician before you embark on this because these medications do have side effects and adverse consequences in vulnerable people and what about aspirin I've heard that aspirin can benefit heart health so I take a baby aspirin every day and if I have a pain that is just too intense for normal functioning as we're defining it then I'll increase that um dose of aspirin and I just assume aspirin is the healthiest and sad for me because well it's also good for heart health and it's killing pain in those instances as opposed to taking anything else is my logic flawed and if it is feel free to tell me no for for you your logic is perfect and that's where it gets to the individual person and for a lot of people that model would work as well so baby asper in 81 milligrams a day acts as an antiplatelet agent it helps you know here even though we're getting controversy over the role of baby aspirin if you dive into the current literature even baby aspirin is controversial even baby aspirin these days and now what they're doing with with the data is defining age ranges when they say baby aspirin yes baby aspirin no and so you know we're learning a lot more about that I still take a baby aspirin every day yeah I take a baby aspirin you get to the higher dose is say four times as much up around 325 milligrams or so it's now an anti-inflammatory it's now acting more like the ibuprofen and the napasin so um different mechanisms of action at different doses I'd like to take a brief moment "

            "text": "interventions to the pain process what about mechanical interventions so I was taught in my basic Neuroscience about I think it's melzack and walls gate theory of pain do I have this right where you know we all have this instinctual response animals have it too right if they uh you bump your knee or your toe that you grab and you rub it and that that rubbing response is actually contributing to the activation of a neural pathway that does indeed reduce the pain through a legitimate neural inhibition and tell me if this is still considered correct and then I'll let you um uh elaborate on it but I think that is an opportunity for us to also talk more generally or for you to educate us more generally on the the mechanistic interventions for pain like um maybe massage above or below the sight of pain maybe acupuncture um so again there will be chemical consequences of any mechanical intervention right as we know because that's the language of the nervous system electricity and chemicals but as opposed to taking a drug you can imagine using manual um stimulation or rubbing around it or or perhaps we can also talk about heat and cold so can we explore that space a bit absolutely and first you're right so uh in your first part uh pack uh Patrick Wall Ron mzac luminaries in the field of pain back in the 60s uh defined the gate control theory of pain and one of the things to build on the story that we talked about with no receptors going to the spinal signals going to the spinal cord heading up to the brain where the perception of pain occurs that's not where the story ends it turns out there are Pathways that come down from the brain down from the brain to the spinal cord that act in an inhibitory role and we'll build on those also from the periphery we've got also fibers called touch fibers these are the ones where they get activated with light touch stroking they refer to as a beta fibers they're fast conducting they head back to the spinal cord and they make some connections with those notive fibers so with that grounding imagine what you said your you hit your thumb with a hammer you um uh you bang something on an extremity uh what is the first thing you do when you hit your thumb with a hammer uh some people rub it I yell some people swear and it turns out there are studies that show that swearing works really swearing reduces pain better than uh than using non-explicit can go out and swear every time they're in pain well they can but they'll have to bear the consequences on an individual basis we're not we're we're absolving ourselves of any responsibility right so uh rubbing uh shaking is another one which basically is activating those touch fibers oh it is I do that everybody does that everybody does that running it underwat which you know it doesn't matter whether you know in this case it's hot or it's cold water it's the running of the water underneath it and what ises it doing we all think it's reducing the stimulus out here and it is not at in the periphery in the periphery what's magical about that I think which is so cool is you're actually changing the signals in your spinal cord way back here in the neck this is the cheapest free version of what we refer to as neuromodulation that's ever been discovered um you're actually by doing that you're changing things the connections back in your spinal cord and it's reducing the no susceptive signals coming in here that's why we do it and it works it works beautifully that's why when a kid gets their boo boo you know parents come and rub it it works what about the kiss the kids sometimes they want to kiss you know or a romantic partner will sometimes like injure themselves I guess it depends on the nature of the relationship and they'll say like can you kiss it of course you know then you kiss it and then like they feel better is that purely psychological well okay I think an important point to to to ground here when it comes to the experience of pain is that everything when we say psychological means Neuroscience I know you know that no no forgive me I I I I have to be careful with with the the wording that I use that's my fault but but it's it's accurate still it is psychological but it is neuroscience based I mean they're really becoming one and the same but to answer your question yes by kissing it you're activating touch fibers we can also agree that there's a positive emotional salience that's associated with that and that positive emotional salience is reducing pain too what interesting up wall and melac sometime later uh there was the introduction of a device to take advantage of this called the tens device and tens is an acronym transcutaneous electrical neuros stimulation and what the tenens device is doing and there's many versions of it now but there are those black electrod you put over the area and they're hooked up to wires and when you turn it on it causes a buzzing sensation and that buzzing sensation is activating those touch fibers the a beta fibers and so it's causing that neuromodulation back in the spinal cord amazing it's cool stuff it's very cool and I and I love that you emphasize that when we're rubbing the periphery or shaking our hand the periphery again being the body surface away from the brain that the real mechanism of action is taking place back in the spinal cord because it really speaks to the the body-wide and the the circuit wide the nervous systemwide nature of this thing that we call pain right it's it's happening out quote unquote out here in the periphery but it's being modulated in the neck level of the spinal cord approximately and then it's you know being interpreted at the level of the brain what explains different pain thresholds I

            "text": "could imagine it could be any or all of the locations that we've been discussing and it could be the context as well right if you're um you know I've heard before and I don't know if this is true that if you have a lot of adrenaline epinephrine in your system that your threshold for pain goes way way up there's probably a chemical basis for that and maybe it's all you know um anecdote but um certainly people have different thresholds for pain I for instance do not have a high pain threshold but I've noticed I have a very quick pain response so if I stub my toe it feels like the most painful thing I could possibly experience but then it's gone very quickly so it's like a quick inflection and then down other people I know uh we've never done the experiment I think I see them stub their toe and they're like ah and then you know 10 minutes later they're still feeling the ache so whose pain threshold is higher it's a it depends on how you define pain threshold so so how do we Define pain threshold what determines pain threshold and I guess the $6 million question are there different pain thresholds between men and women as it relates to the whole story about childbirth being very painful and that Women quote unquote have higher pain thresholds I just I just sent you about 10 questions forgive me yeah um so what is pain threshold yeah no it's a it's a great place to start and maybe I don't know if you want to Circle back around at some point to the heat and cold to finish up the mechanical but for no no no you're let me answer your get to your pain threshold so the pain threshold is uh that stimulus intensity that results in the onset of the experience of pain the first onset of the experience of pain so you know when you turn up the heat it's it's not when it's warm it's not when it's just hot it's when the the heat becomes the perception of pain like when it becomes painfully hot at that point in time the same works for cold you mentioned some of the distinction between your experiences of pain to a stimulus and your buddies and that's normal that first onset of pain again those are those fast fibers those ad Delta fibers boom right to your brain those are the protective ones that when we put our hand on a hot stove we immediately Jerk it back we don't even have a conscious perception yet that we did that and then it's a moment later when the sea fibers are getting up to the brain and the other AD Delta fibers are converging into conscious areas of brain that we're like oh wow that stove is really hot and the ca fibers in particular are converging on more emotional regions in the brain that are conveying an unpleasantness to that experience you don't like it you and you don't want it to happen again which is why it encodes memories so you only had to do that once as a child now getting into the the pain thresholds you asked one of the other questions is do men and women have different pain um thresholds uh the answer the short answer is yes this has been established and I want to be careful here with saying a couple things one is in general uh men have uh higher paining thresholds to things like heat stimulus than women and what what people have to also though understand as scientists we make a big deal out of small differences right you know what we do is we take a group of people in this case men and women and we apply the same uh thermal stimulus to them and we draw averages the average man has this stimulus the average woman has this stimulus and we say well women have have a little bit more sensitivity to that heat stimulus and so we then go into the press and we say uh men are tougher than women that's a terrible statement right because the tough part is a subjective label right I mean it it it gets to a whole bunch of different issues around the Adaptive role of pain right I mean I mean one could argue that if your threshold for pain is lower that your it serves a more adaptive function right fewer injures Etc I mean I guess it gets into the implications of what we mean by quote unquote tougher it does but it also misses I think the big point which is people are not averages so what I mean by that is um while the average for a woman may be somewhat less than a man if you look at the distribution of the curves they highly overlap meaning the individual variability within men and within women is much greater than the difference between men and women but there's plenty of women on that curve that have much greater heat uh thresholds than men Doh but when you pull things you end up with that difference unfortunately when things are picked up and you want a quick sound bite out of it that's what it gets distilled down to so so it's not unlike height for that matter I me there a lot of women that are taller than men that's exactly it but on average men are taller than women on average and I would say within this area of uh pain threshold differences it's even closer it's even tighter you know it would be I'm making this up the equivalent I think the average height of a woman is 53 5'4 the average height of a man 5'9 510 this is Imagining the average height being you know 5'6 for a woman and 5'8 for a man you know it's not a huge difference there's a lot of things that play into to changes in pain "

many of us it's very much the same it's when it gets to the brain now it's shaped and it's shaped by things such as um your beliefs about that stimulus your expectations around it how much anxiety you're having at the moment does increased anxiety increase one's perceived pain yes okay yeah it does um your early life experiences with this so have you had traumatic experiences in the past that alters brain circuits can I interject a question yeah if one was told just suck it up a lot or if one whimpered or cursed when they uh hurt themselves if they were told um you know don't be a wuss don't be a wimp do we know whether or not that increases or decreases the subjective feeling of pain later I could imagine it going either way I could imagine the kid that was told don't be a wuss when they cried as a consequence of expressing pain or an experience of pain secretly feeling more pain because they aren't able to express the emotionality around the pain but that if we just look from the outside we say wow like pretty tough adult right because they're not um crying out in pain so do we have any are there any experiments that have explored that I don't know you're getting into this is a good point getting into um uh pediatric pain and you know if there's been experiments in that space I stay mainly in the adult area and my experience with raising a child is an N of one with one son um he's done great thank you I happen to know him very well he's a he's he's what you call a great example of Highly Successful reproduction so you know it's say what do they say it's better to be lucky than good uh so sure I'm sure there was a lot involved so don't don't discount don't uh don't discard any credit thank you thank you um you know my Approach with Ian was not to say just you know necessarily suck it up but I would uh you know make light of it i' I'd have fun with it and uh I would kind of laugh and I'm like way to go buddy uh and I would find he would often laugh you know so I think a lot of it is the cues they're taking off the parents you know and again this is this is just my oneof end parent is if they see you freaking out kid's going to freak out too um but does there get to be a point where you're ignoring your child or your loved On's painful issue yeah now you're getting into some maladaptive some bad space where I think it's sending that person the wrong message and they may very well have problems later on I will tell just a very brief anecdote when I was growing up I observed a total of zero children and friends who you know cried out in pain or complained of pain who were told you know um that was an inappropriate response um sometimes I might have heard parents say you know come on just suck it up or like or rub it you'll be okay that kind of thing but once and only once with had some friends I won't tell you what country they were from but they they lived not far from um where both Ian and I grew up since we grew up near one another and I'll never forget that the younger brother of a friend of mine ran over to the father he had cut his thumb on the band saw and it wasn't particularly deep but he was crying in pain and the father wrapped it picked up his chin and smacked him across the face and said don't ever do that again and so what I think he was doing was compounding the the lesson about the saw yeah but clearly had no regard for the pain that the that the injury probably caused now I haven't followed up with that kid um I think we can all agree that by today's standards that would be considered um abusive parenting uh or perhaps um you know one could say that was you know on the far extreme of a response but I'll never forget that and I went home and I I told my mom yeah and she said oh yeah when I was growing up that was actually a more frequent response to kids hurting them themselves especially boys and so things have really changed in terms of how we react to children in pain but the reason I find this interesting is that ultimately what we're talking about is how should we interpret our own pain yeah can I can I make a commentary about that scenario and I want to bring in another Neuroscience concept that that Dad may have been doing inadvertently and that's something called conditioned pain modulation so there's another cool phenomenon in in pain that pain inhibits pain so what I mean by that is when you were you know this guy this kid but or yourself growing up did you ever walk up to your buddy and say you know my my arm really hurts you know I injured it the other day and what did what did your buddy do they'd stomp on your foot and you'd say why the heck did you do that you I must have growing up with the same friends oh yeah yeah and and they'd say well now doesn't doesn't your arm feel better and i' be like well yeah it does and yeah I did grow up with those friends I tell this story to some people and I sometimes just get the wide eyes like they did what yeah we are not making recommendations here we're not making recommendations but it's a real phenomenon it was described by Laars late 70s 78 or something like that in rodent models initially and what happens is that when you engage a no susceptive stimulus or a painful stimulus and a site distal different from where the primary pain is it engages a brain stem circuit that has descending Pathways to the spinal cord and inhibits pain amazing pain inhibits pain it works it also is thought to have some contributions from higher brain centers we call this whole phenomenon lears called this phenomenon diffuse noxious inhibitory control or denck the human version of this is called conditioned pain modulation why I bring this up not only to help explain that father's actions somehow I don't think that he was thinking oh my kid's got a painful uh you know hand or finger he cut himself I'm going to slap him off the side of the head he'll feel better I don't think that's what was going through his head he wanted to make him feel worse so he didn't go near the band saw without being more cautious but it probably did reduce the pain a little bit to some extent now where it's key is oh my maybe we'll get into it later with chronic pain is in some chronic painful conditions the CPM or the denck doesn't work m like fibromyalgia being one um so pain inhibits pain uh is another Neuroscience concept related to pain that's rather cool well and I'm sorry I missed your question to could you repeat noing you answer the question and and uh expand it on it in a in a completely surprising and far more interesting way than I ever anticipated so thank you I I'm betting that 98% of people listening to this including myself have never heard that pain inhibits pain incredible let's go back to heat and cold we briefly touched on heat but let's talk about the use of uh quote unquote therapeutic heat or therapeutic cold a cold pack for a you know a you know a bruise that really aches or maybe even a break or a sprain or heat you know the in the world of sport physio cold is now heavily debated localized cold is heavily debated you know you get people saying things I don't know if this is true that you know it creates a sludging of the of the fluids trying to head in and out of the injury so cold is not as good as heat heat allows for um the uh inclusion and removal of waste products and you know there are all sorts of Just So Stories that people make up some of which might be true I don't know but what do we know about heat and cold as physiological stimula in terms of their ability to "

level of heat or cold and one is in pain um you know when I was a kid we had a hot water bottle that for times when we were sick with something but sometimes you know if I felt an ache on the side I'd put some hot water in the hot water bottle lie on that thing watch some cartoons i' definitely felt better sure sure well putting aside the Contemporary controversies over the mechanisms you described which are I think very real and need to be sorted out traditionally historically we tend to think of applying cold for the first 48 hours or so after an acute injury and then heat thereafter cold has some really cool effects cold uh reduces inflammation so it reduces some of the release of those inflammatory chemicals we talked about prostaglandins cyto histamines um other chemo kindes all these fancy terms for substances that sensitize the primary Noor and it reduces the release of those and it reduces inflammation another cool thing often not appreciated is nerves don't fire as fast when they're cold and so if you've got no acceptors that are firing and you put cold it's slowing the number of signals coming up and by definition it's reducing the the the ultimately the pain you're experiencing now heat heat has an obvious effect of increasing blood flow it's going to help uh relax muscles and get blood into those muscles and that's probably why you were putting that hot water bottle on um and it just darn feels good and so what what do I tell people you know in part I tell people use whichever works best for them um I find there's huge individual variability in whether people like heat or like cold and within reason uh they're safe what do I mean within reason don't go putting an ice pack on an extremity for two hours you know you'll get a frostbite so you know take care with that how cold should one make the point on their body that's in pain assuming of course that they're not going to give themselves frostbite meaning do you want to numb the area you know get past that point point where it's a little bit painful and then that you know basically you're shutting down some neural Pathways and you don't feel anything there it's numb and then you let the blood flow return When you remove the cold pack is that I mean that's a reasonable suggestion okay yeah all right well people I think will appreciate that the um the specifics of that because um you know and of course listeners of this podcast often are interested in whole body deliberate cold immersion you know cold showers ice baths Etc most people experience those as somewhat painful as they get into them yeah and then can experience some numbness when they get out is it possible to raise one's pain threshold through the regular exposure to pain in ways that are safe such as deliberate cold exposure assuming that one doesn't stay in too long and it's not too cold um and or through you know we were talking about sports earlier but just in general like can we raise our pain threshold so that life is less painful the short answer to your last question is yes um the answer to your other question about about uh extreme cold and cold exposure which I know you have a lot of expertise and you can teach me a lot I'm going to stay in my wheelhouse at because I I'm not up on the literature in that space even in its intersection with pain um it's an intriguing concept uh I have to imagine that it makes sense you would get some habituation uh with that repeated exposure I think one of the the questions that would come up with for instance the cold exposure Ure and I don't know the answer to this but it's I'm sure maybe somebody out there does is is there cross modality um changes in pain thresholds I mean if you expose yourself a lot to cold does it change your heat thresholds I don't I would surprise be surprised if it did yeah would or your pressure because those are separate parallel Pathways yeah yeah you know there uh and you know as an aside I hate the cold but I do really well with the heat you know and so does Ian uh you know I think there's something genetic there uh so you know I mentioned earlier around men and women and heat uh thresholds and I chose that specifically but each of these are different depending on the stimulus modality can you change ultimately your thresholds yeah where that involves is a lot of cognitive control it's a lot of cognitive training uh around that space and you know there's there's clearly approaches to that people have learned that there's different manipulations around that so one experiment this wasn't intended at least I don't believe so they were measuring uh heat thresholds uh on college students and and we we experiment a lot on students as as we all know we pay them well um and what they found is that when they're studying guys studying dudes when there was an attractive woman who was delivering the stimulus the thresholds were higher because the guys did not want to look like a wuss in front of this attractive young woman and that's been pretty well established so the experimenter their gender uh plays a big role in that has the reverse experiment also been done I don't I don't know I don't know interesting um but getting back to your point Point yes um I think through a number of uh you know cognitive manipulations you can ultimately um over time change those thresholds another one area is ex is movement exercise you know clearly changes uh those thresholds over time you are probably building up um some increased inhibitory tone through that process I'd like to take a quick break and

            "text": "this idea of whether or not under conditions of stress or in this case pain whether or not the most adaptive mindset assuming it's not a tissue damaging level of pain would be to think about something else distract oneself from the pain or conversely whether or not one should quote unquote go into the pain so for people who have chronic pain Maybe it's in a a small area of the body that experiences chronic pain pain quite often AK chronic pain or maybe it's whole body pain I don't think it really matters for the question I'm asking and people are trying to develop some cognitive ways so what we call as neuroscientists you and I top down mechanisms for like okay I'm going to distract myself from the pain I'm going to focus on other things I really enjoy or rather I'm going to really go into the pain meet the pain and realize I don't know somehow that it's not as bad like somehow there's a and again this becomes very opaque right we don't really know what we're talking about when we when we do these sorts of protocols but those sorts of things are out there in the mindfulness space and I think um I certainly take mindfulness seriously as as an intervention but what always bothers me about those sorts of interventions is that they lack the specificity and the granularity and there's no kind of mechanistic logic to explain them so what what are your thoughts on on meeting the pain versus distracting oneself from the pain let's break that down because there's two concepts there as you alluded to and they're both effective and they both work differently so one is attentional distraction where you are distracting yourself from the thing that is causing pain clearly works in a lot of people and that's why one of the strategies that we recommend for patients for people living with pain is to engage in distracting activities read a book um uh go for a walk um spend time with friends and family in particular in the community and work to get your mind off of pain what we've learned is it that attentional distraction engages specific brain networks they tend to be some of the outer layer of brain networks in your prefrontal cortex some in your singulate cortex um in other regions which are clearly involved with distraction it's not necessarily that distraction is going to completely eliminate one's pain but it can reduce it uh significantly and this is why the biggest problem with distraction from a time of the day is at night it's when people are trying to sleep during the daytime you can read that book you can spend time with friends and family but people with chronic pain that have it 24 seven you can't distract yourself at night when you're trying to get into a relaxed State and fall asleep and that's why sleep is such a big issue for people with chronic pain so attentional distraction it it works distraction works now what you said I mean the second piece you said kind of let's meet the pain if you will and there's different approaches to meeting the pain one approach that you invoked with mindfulness is is addressing the pain from a non-judgmental accepting manner I'm aware the pain is there I am not going to judge it I'm not going to put a value on it's bad it's good or anything I'm just going to note its presence and that has been shown to work as well in fact actually when John kabat Zen originally developed mindfulness-based stress reduction people with low back pain PL Studies have shown that it works I've completed just some recent studies in mbsr uh as well and we're diving deeply into the data so it's this non-judgmental acceptance if you will of the pain sorry mbsr is the acronym for mindfulness based stress reduction mbsr everybody should do mbsr let me be C I have no Financial relationship with any of this by the way but mindfulness-based stress reduction has been shown effective for anxiety for depression for pain just about everything I think they should put it into all the schools uh it's it's a great skill to learn no side effects takes a little bit of time to learn it and uh it can be in some people effective and helpful for pain and that's the key that we're going to keep coming back to is some of these things work for some of the people some of the time there's a third aspect of meeting the pain and that is more of a direct cognitive reframing about the meaning of the pain now you're coming at the pain and you have um an approach you're making effort on what you're thinking of the pain is that pain damaging threatening harmful or do you view it as yeah it hurts but it's not harming me that is a critical critical aspect of pain management and that is serves as a foundation for something called cognitive behavioral therapy the the cool thing about a number of these is that there's actually different neural circuits engaged with these different approaches and um I think the key that we have to figure out and this is where research is going is which approach works for which person under which circumstance so interesting uh something you said about understanding the pain but not um overinterpreting or catastrophizing the pain seems important knowing the difference between being hurt or feeling hurt versus being injured has been something that's been important to me I've been involved in sports uh where clearly pain was involved it's like I'm hurt but am I injured that's the first question you know like I've rolled an ankle like oh you know like I'm limping this hurts am I injured meaning am I going to be back at it in an hour tomorrow versus I've broken bones and it's you know you know great empathy for anybody that does like when you're injured you feel the snap and you know you're out for a while in some cases um so I think knowing the difference between being hurt and being injured is something that's kind of that key moment and for me it's always been experienced as a moment of anxiety after feeling pain especially in a sports year like uh oh like am I am I going to have to take two weeks off or is this just pain so I think for people to be able to recognize when pain is reporting an injury versus when pain is just reporting a temporary sensation is really important and perhaps also for psychological hurt versus psychological injury I mean that gets to some larger context themes these days of somebody says something it upsets us are we hurt or are we injured right you know I think it gets very murky how does one determine if they are hurt versus injured and then maybe we "

last um really 10 to 15 years there's been a pretty dramatic shift in terms of how Society at large interprets emotional pain right people hearing things or seeing things and the idea that emotional pain could be related to physical pain or at least similar enough to it that people's emotional pain is valid right and if anything I'm here to validate the fact that emotional pain is valid like any other pain except it is different because it becomes very hard to point to a specific kind of threshold we're using that word a lot today but I think it's appropriate here threshold between hurt and harmed whereas if I tell you that my left foot hurts which it did a lot in high school and then you took an x-ray of my foot in high school you'd say your foot's broken because it was broken a lot in high school and that's harmed I mean to continue to do what I was doing to break it in the first place I was harm clearly going to harm myself worse so I had to had to heal up but when it comes to psycholog iCal pain you know Psychiatry has all these thresholds for normal functioning versus abnormal functioning are you sleeping well normal relationship and on and on we don't want to go there because that's not our place but how do you when you see patients how do you take into account the level or the thresholds for their emotional pain because that's part of your job so I'm asking you this from the perspective of a somebody who treats pain how do you gauge somebody's psychological pain is it by how intensely they vocal ize their pain or does it always go back to how well or poorly their life is being managed at the level of sleep nutrition relationships and so forth yeah great great set of questions there's a lot in there let me first start off with something very simple I don't try to distinguish between this notion of psychological pain physical pain it's pain and of and of I think once I get into where you get into this trying to distinguish is this psychological pain or psychogenic pain which was a terrible term or physical pain you end up putting value judgments on people and I don't think it serves us well when we're caring for the person in front of us if they're in pain I'm addressing the pain the thing to note is at least in people that come into our at Stanford Pain Management Center and other pain centers is that remember pain is a sensory and emotional experience it's all wrapped up and so we want to treat the whole person sometimes we get we get easy we get easy ones and we just go do a nerve block and pain goes away and that's simple but usually it's much more complex where we're seeing the interaction of uh an expression of pain that includes includes a significant amount of anxiety of depression you mentioned this term catastrophizing which we can break down if you'd like and that's probably one of the biggest predictors factors in uh in amplification of pain and worsening pain and poor treatment response is catastrophizing um I try to treat the whole person and not really partial out all this I do at Stanford I you I built a digital Health System that captures measures a lot of data around a patient's experience across physical psychological and social functioning and we use that data to Target therapies to understand um how much their depressive symptoms are anxiety anger anger big issue in pain huge in pain does it make it worse or better invariably it makes it worse yeah and you know you can break anger down in a couple different categories John Burns and others has broken it into like anger in versus anger out I don't know if that term is familiar with you um anger out that's my father um loud loud angry boisterous banging you know would quickly turn anything into an angry tiate anger out expressive yelling at the at the news yes yelling at somebody who cuts you off in traffic usually yelling at the man uh cuz he hated job um anger in boiling simmering you know self-contained seething that's anger in data seems to support anger in is is worse it's bad so it's not necessarily whether or not it's directed at someone external in both cases anger in and anger out can be directed at someone external it's a question of whether or not it's expressed outwardly or contained inside beautifully stated beautifully stated so we C you know anger depression anxiety uh we capture fatigue sleep and so what we try to do is again look at the whole person because they're not just a back if that's where they're having pain or not just a neck or a shoulder in your case it's impacting the whole person and we just got done talking earlier about how all of these circuits interact with each other and so sometimes we can't just eliminate the no susception in the periphery sometimes we can reduce it but what we have to do is Target everything and we have to try to Target all these circuits up here and in many cases what we're doing is through education through pain psychology um through physical therapy and re rehabilitative approaches on top of it and yes the medications we have now you know we touched Bas on a few earlier but we have over 200 medications available for pain um very few of them FDA approved uh we tend to steal from all the other fields so you're talking about more than 200 medications that can be yes prescribed for pain but as off Lael treatments perfectly stated yeah there's only a few medications that are actually FDA approved specifically for pain so what we what we do is we borrow or steal from the psychiatrists some of their uh their anti-depressants uh which will frequently work very effectively for pain and work on those pain related circuits in the brain we uh take from the neurologist some of the anti-seizure medications because those medications um while reducing separately seizures for people who don't have seizures they work on ION channels um they work on other neuromodulators that also are involved in pain circuitry we can take from the cardiologist medications that work on the heart anti- arhythmia or heart rhythm drugs they are potent sodium channel blockers and the sodium channels as you know are responsible for the action potential that generates the nerve impulse signal and so they're like an oral local anesthetic that you take and so we we we take from everybody in our field in the medications getting back to to what you said so just summarizing one I I don't really distinguish uh psychological versus physical pain in my world I I find it better just to treat it as pain and look at the person holistically and go after all the components at once I find that's where we get the best results and it is typically bringing a lot of tools to Bear speaking of tools to Bear What role if any does nutrition "

            "text": "play in local or whole body pain I critical and I think we're learning more and more and more about uh the role of good nutrition of healthy eating anti-inflammatory diets uh avoidance of foods that are triggers um and an incredibly underappreciated area um you know I've had my experiences with chronic pain um I developed uh an abdominal chronic pain problem uh shortly after I turned 50 I was throwing a happy hour for our pain psychologists of all people went to a Mexican restaurant I won't name which one got food poisoning That's why I'm not naming it good Mexican food bad food poisoning and ever since that event I can't eat anything in the onion family what um I'm familiar with with onions but what else is in the onion family I'm sure you've researched this now pretty thoroughly considering what you're describing classic and the what we refer to as fod Maps you know it's one of the fod maps and I have now some issues with the others and um manifested by just severe severe up abdominal pain and um not many other symptoms but you know it put me on this journey where uh severe abdominal pain didn't know why couldn't sleep couldn't sleep went like I'd go months without having a restful night's sleep I thought I was getting early Alzheimer's because I felt like I was getting stupid and um what actually benefited me was of all things the pandemic why because what did we all do we isolated we started eating the same foods and I started noticing I was feeling better when I was eating certain foods my abdominal pain went away and I'd start doing as a scientist experiments and I finally was was able to isolate and determine what the problem was so now I have complete avoidance on that I'm I'm a little difficult to go out to a restaurant and have dinner but you know so no onions no onions and what else shallots chives scallions leaks anything in the onion family you know not alium I'm fine with garlic and you know by healthy eating by identifying something by triggers changed my life and return to a degree of normaly I think the key for people is you know if you have any kind of similar issues identify those triggers sometimes uh isolation of you know Foods or restrictions and using a journal and then as you learn from that slowly build Foods back into your diet I think it's so important for people to hear this and thanks for sharing your personal story around this because I think that nutrition while every physician seems to appreciate that the quality of nutrition matters defining what quality nutrition is is really difficult there's still you know Avid even we could call them ranous debates about this you know vegan versus omnivore versus this and you know but it sounds like this is a case where it can become very individualized but I could imagine somebody going to their physician and that physician not being you and saying yeah you know I notice that when I eat certain foods I'm in a lot of pain and the physician simply saying well don't eat those foods but unless that person is a trained scientist like not knowing how to go about doing the sorts of experiments that you did would be difficult impossible I'm sorry I know I interrupt you I just want to build on that if I if I can one of the key things I simplified my story but the key thing is is if I if I eat onions or anything that onion family it's pain for two weeks wow it is so the thing is is if you get repeated Expos exposures it never stops and it gets very very hard to figure out what it was so it's not like you eat something you get pain it goes away where you know we can all do that pattern recognition here you have to be able to think back what happened two weeks ago that may have influenced it so it's not easy well this may be a case for elimination diets which are uh provide they're done safely where people restrict the number of foods they eat to a very limited number of foods make sure they still get enough calories and macronutrients uh that they need protein fats and carbohydrates or what what have you but that by limiting the total number of foods that they eat to like eight or 10 basic things then you can build things in and then explore what triggers the pain or what removes the pain I don't really see any other way I am intrigued by The Onion example even though it's a it's a it's your case in particular and we don't want to extrapolate too broadly is there something about onions that's triggering a particular neurochemical or immune pathway do we have any knowledge of like why onions would create that kind of gut pain this has been a journey I've been on now for a few years to answer this um uh one of our GI pain docks that we have come in the Clin lyen newwin sent me a paper from I know Sellar nature that showed that after a gut infection it can change the genetic expression related to sensitizing you to food antigens I know I throw out a lot of jargon there basically the short answer is you get an infection and your gut no longer responds properly to a normal food item and so one explanation may be I got this infection I was at a Mexican restaurant a lot of onions and I got sensitized through that infection now subsequently to onions you know I saw a Stanford uh allergist Hannah Watford who's awesome by the way and uh after I had this I think figured out and I went in and I'm like well you know Dr Watford is there anything I can do for this and she laughed and she's like no you're doing everything it's all just avoidance and I thinking I was rather unique and special about this thing I said you know do you ever see this and she said oh yeah I see this all the time every day I see this all the time and I said like this isn't unusual he's like no I see this thing all the time and this thing meaning sensitivity stivity to certain know to certain to different these different food groups and this this thing that occurs later in life something an event that happens to somebody that triggers and I said well gosh that sounds like a public health problem and she's like that's what we're debating right now in the allergy Community is whether this is representing more of a public health issue and is because I'm seeing I Dr Watford I'm seeing increasing amounts of this uh as we go forward how interesting well um this is not a time to plug the philanthropic arm of our premium podcast but uh I'm very involved in science philanthropy this sounds like an area to De devote some funding to to explore how foods are impacting the local and systemic pain response yeah I I got in you know so I'm running a large biomarker study to characterize people deeply and one of the things that I wanted to put in there is microbiome characterization now to be clear that's out of my wheelhouse but the beauty of being at Stanford and other major institutions is you can go make friends yeah Justin sonenberg who's been a guest on this podcast is one of the world experts on the gut microbiome we have a few others too so there you go so he's a friendly guy I'm sure he'll collaborate we go we go make friends and people who understand the microbiome we collect the samples and that's where team science is magical and once again the idea looking at the whole person as long as we're talking about the gut um let's talk about pain inside "

            "text": "describing an example of referenced pain so my understanding of referenced pain is that you know like for instance I I've got a slight bulge at I think like my lumbar 34 disc or something I had a whole body scan recently just a um an exploration scan cuz I had the opportunity not not anything serious fortunately and there's a slightly bulg disc there and every once in a while if I do certain movements um in the gym I'll get pain down in my right hip and sometimes going down my leg and I used to think it was sciatica cuz you assume anything on the right back side okay must be wallet induced s sciatica back pocket wallet into sciatica um but what I eventually realized is that well it's this dis buul it just so happens that the nerves that emit from that that region um they Branch out to a bunch of different areas and so you think the pain is in your leg but the the issue is someplace else or um and occasionally indeed I feel the pain elsewhere in my body as well it's sort of like a like a matching of regions for pain that seem unrelated is that a way to think about reference pain perfectly the the the examples also I referred to of a heart attack causing referred pain or also the pelvic region associated with back pain as a way of um referred pain um what you're describing is the fact that pain doesn't have to start with an injury or a stimulus in the periphery you could damage the nerves anywhere along the way and that will be perceived as pain we refer to that as neuropathic pain so that's another distinction you brought up uh nicely good good segue into there's thought to be um several different types or categories of pain we have been talking through much of this time about somatic pain you know injury out here we talked about visceral pain and when you have damage to a peripheral nerve damage injury to a peripheral nerve or the central nervous system we refer to that as neuropathic pain it frequently has different qualities different characteristics people will refer to it as shooting stabbing shock like burning it can frequently uh when there's a damage to a nerve or damage to certain regions of the brain be incredibly challenging to treat by the way the good news is with that uh light disc bulge is the vast majority of time the discs reabsorb yeah I have to be careful to not do too much um spinal flexion like sit-ups and stuff I thought that that would help but that actually doesn't strengthen the back it was actually a asymmetry between the abdominal muscles and the lower back muscles so provided I do a lot of back extension type training then that bulge more or less stays in I just have to be a little little cautious not too cautious fortunately as long as we're talking about referenced pain somatic visceral and all the rest what about associative or referenced pain where it's psychological and I don't want to get too abstract here but more and more these days I hear from people who say you know I was in this job and the job sucked or I was in this relationship and the relationship sucked and I had terrible back pain like really acute localized back pain or chronic headaches or migraines yeah and then they go on vacation or they change their circumstances and lo and behold the pain goes away does that surprise you as an expert in pain not at all not at all what you're you know simp simplistically referring to is you know there's people are undergoing stress and we have we clearly know that the brain is not a passive recipient of information coming in from the body it's a two-way street the brain is causing Downstream consequences in the body the brain uh controls our sympathetic nervous system and parasympathetic nervous system the sympathetic being the fight andlight response it controls the tone of uh cortisol that's being released and we all know that in acute situations rapid increases of cortisol and um nor adrenaline is keeps us away from the Lions and the Tigers and the bears oh my but in a chronic situation and uh Robert spolski as you know at Stanford has built a career around chronic stress at least in part and very bad for us and so these chronic stressors impact the end organ the tissue and it's real pain it doesn't mean that we need to go get back surgery it means that probably we need to identify the stressors that are contributing to that and address those and we'll often find that in the scenarios you outline that the pain gets better um some of those targets are interesting um there's a lot of memory associated with pain this is where early life events occur and those early life events and injuries can sensitize us to Future vulnerability so I was in a car act bad car accident when I was 16 uh fortunate to walk away from it got bad whiplash if I get stressed a lot of my pain manifests in my neck for me as a pain do it's a signal to me that's like go work out go for a walk in the forest you know uh and take some time away from the computer again that's a simplistic message and my experience doesn't translate into everybody else but I'm just validating every everything that you you said let's consider the opposite scenario which is positive emotions uh "

            "text": "you've done some very nice studies exploring how being in positive relationships being in love in fact can change our perception that is our experience of pain and probably does so at real physiological levels as you mentioned earlier psychological is physiological and vice versa it's hard to separate the two but could you share with us uh what you did in that study and what you found because I find it really interesting and it also points to the incredible power of love in uh how we experience life yeah yeah I think there's several cool things about that study that I love to share one is how it all came about so um you know us Neuroscience Geeks often go to the society for Neuroscience as an annual meeting and I was hanging out and uh sharing a room with art Aaron who studies passionate love and he and his wife study passionate love and we were having a glass or two of wine and I'm asking art have you ever you know have you ever studied pain he's like no I study love and he's like have you ever studied love no I study pain if has anybody ever studied the intersection another glass of wine no let's do it so we came back to Stanford and there was a young postto Jared younger who's now a professor at the University of Alabama and I said Jared we were either going to fall flat in her face or we're going to this is going to be a cool study and Jared took this on great job so what we did is we advertised on campus for couples in an early phase of a romantic relationship because there's a reason for choosing that in an early phase of a romantic relationship you are deeply focused on your beloved they're on your mind all the time you feel great when you're with them you feel terrible when you're not with them doesn't that just sound like an addiction I mean it's that yearning uh I don't know that's it's a can be a pleasant experience but addictions you know for the people who are using the substance can find it you know in that early phase very pleasant but it it turns out that the early phase of a romantic relationship engages the same neural circuitries as addiction interesting same reward circuitry all that so we chose that and so he said come to us and bring pictures of your beloved and bring pictures of an equally attractive acquaintance clothed this isn't sex that we're studying uh clothed and we caused them pain in the scanner and and and we paid them afterwards um we needed a control condition for this because thinking about your beloved is very uh attentionally demanding remember we talked about attentional distraction earlier so we gave people what's called a word generation task very simply um can you think about every sport that doesn't involve a ball okay uh frisbee hockey boxing boxing okay that's attentionally demanding think about every vegetable that's not green and you know so you're running that through your head and we're causing you pain it's an intentional distraction task so we flash people pictures of their beloved cause pain flash people of their acquaintance cause pain and then distraction okay what did we find love works great love works great it was a wonderful analgesic it significantly reduced people's pain and it turned out the more in love you were the more pain relief you got when viewing the photo of the person you love yes when View doing the photo of the person you love now how did we know how much in love they were it turns out the psychologists have got scales for everything and one of them is a passionate love scale which asks how what percentage of the day are you preoccupied thinking about your beloved oh goodness you just sent people now off to give their Partners the passionate love scale to figure out how much time they're spending thinking about them yeah we we had Stanford students some of them thinking about their beloved 80% of the day uh I wanted to use this as a screening tool for our resident applicants because uh I I I want them focusing on patients not their beloved and that is by the way a joke that bad joke but but probably is real world we're not just talking about Stanford I mean but when somebody's writing you a script or a prescription that is or giving you advice um yeah you might want to know if they are in a new romantic relationship yeah so the the the other I thought the other uh cool thing about this study was attention worked also but attention and love worked on different circuits so attentional distraction they worked equally well attention again worked on some of these prefrontal regions these outer cortical areas love worked on more of what we classically think of is these reward-based circuits the nucleus accumbens uh the amydala um one of the the descending uh brain stem regions called the substantia which is coming down from the brain through that area to the spinal cord to inhibit pain so classic addiction Pathways classic and so the key again message for people is um different what we would think of as psychological approaches engaging different brain circuits to reduce pain I'll leave you with one last uh side note that we didn't publish on and that is uh Jared went back a year later and we assessed the student strength of their relationship if assuming it was still ongoing and he found that there was a rather High correlation between the love induced analgesia and brain activity and the cadate nucleus and in the insular with the strength of their relationship a year later it was so we had a brain scan that was a predictor a future um strength of a relationship could you tell us the direction of those results so if a new romantic partnership is uh creating high levels of activity in these two brain areas you just mentioned then it is a very good predictor that the relationship will yes survive over time well in this limited sample it meant that it it was going to be very strong a year later um understand and you know Andrew we always have to put these caveats unpublished non-peer reviewed it was a fun post Haw data analysis that I'm not sure if anybody's ever you know run with those kind of things no but we can explore it in a in a playful way now and people can do with it what they will it does sort of speak to something important though um assuming that result would hold up if the same experiment were done and you know many hundreds or thousands of people it sort of speaks to the idea that the activation of these addiction likee circuits in the early phase of a passionate love relationship set in motion a certain number of things that create stability in that relationship which on the face of it um makes sense but we've also all heard of the opposite way of well as well which is you know um Fools Rush In or that uh things that start fast end fast or things like that but here you're talking about um the early phase of passion serving this interesting role in terms of analgesia uh alleviating pain but also predicting some stability of the relationship over time it's kind of interesting it's fascinating to talk about uh you know I feel like I have to put that caveat in that not generalized but a fun thing to talk about and it's where I think cool scientific ideas can come from for future exploration that I think that's also what's pretty neat um I find the um you know again the different circuits for different approaches to reducing pain fascinating again that gets to the question you asked me earlier is there one circuit and the answer is no what we have to do is figure out what is the best circuit for a particular person or set of circuits if you're willing I'd like to talk about "

            "text": "opioids well I think that most people hear about the opioid crisis and just assume that they are quote unquote overprescribed that people are given opioid drugs as a Frontline treatment perhaps more than they should that the addictive component which I understand is very real that the potential for addiction is very real um as well as the potential for um cross interactions with other things like alcohol um and perhaps even other illicit drugs you know street drugs perhaps if like if people can't fill their prescriptions um and tolerance to the opioids creating issues where people then need more of them they're do I have a not close family member but a a you know distant family member who had his entire life in arranged beautifully it was a practicing lawyer with a beautiful wife and family had a back injury uh was Pres cribed oxy conton it it helped him initially but then it it set off some behavioral psychological Pathways that had him seeking more forging prescriptions when you know he understood the law he was a lawyer he eventually went to jail got out the same thing happened again he eventually ended up dead right so and I think there are many examples of that that we hear about and those are very Salient and very disturbing very saddening so I think that most people including myself hear the opioid crisis and assume that what we really should be doing is Seeking a better alternative but what I'm hearing from you is that there are use cases where opioids make a great deal of sense and that they've really helped improve people's lives and that none of what I just described or anything like it is experienced by those people in fact quite the opposite do I have that right perfectly and and that's again where we we we need to treat these at an individual level on a case-by Case basis um and that one size doesn't fit all um yes opioids were overprescribed I think everybody agrees to that in this country um and we went through a period of time with massive overprescribing and there's a lot of nuance and reasons why in large part um Physicians we get terrible education around pain and we don't know how to treat it in general coming out of medical school we get about 7 hours of education on pain uh veterinarians get 40 it's great if you're taking I think your dog's name is Castello yeah unfortunately he passed but he took some pain meds for a short while but I found an alternative treatment that worked far better perfect which turned out to be by the way lowd do testosterone he was castrated like he was fixed when he was younger um and I it's interesting i' I've gone I've said publicly on very large scale podcasts that I gave my dog lowdose testosterone later in life and it ameliorated a lot of his aches and pains at least from what I understood because he started moving better and feeling better and sleeping better and I expected the veter community to come after me with pitchforks not one wow did that and yet I heard from hundreds of veterinarians that said yes we wish that we could prescribe those sorts of things to people who castrate their male dogs later in life to humiliate their symptoms um so that opened up to me a whole world of understanding about some of the restrictions that vet that vets face in terms of what they prescribe there's a whole discussion to be had about that we'll do a series on animal and pet health vet Health great well the Vets hopefully are healthy too you get the point yeah but when it comes to the opioid crisis in this discussion you know I think it's become so Laden with the idea that like doctors are on the take like they're getting paid to give opioids to patients and that's why they're doing that and and I don't believe that necessarily be the case but I think that's what the public perception is that it's all Financial here's the here's the thing um were there bad docks doing bad things yes um I'm going to invoke uh a good friend of mine Keith humph at St oh yeah terrific terrific um psychologist who's an addiction medicine uh psychologist and public policy person and the way he breaks it down and I subscribe to this is you know the there's three types of Physicians remember there's about a million physicians in this country about a million um you've got Physicians doing the right thing for the right reasons vast majority of docs we need to leave them alone we need to support them we need to help them do their job and not put more obstructions in their way there is a much smaller group of docs doing the wrong thing for the right reasons what I mean by that is these are docs who did overprescribe opioids in this case in this context they um did buy into the marketing messages that were put forward they did not have much education around Alternatives in treating pain and they thought by handing out pills just pills uh in their very brief visits with patients remember Primary Care dox as my heart goes out to them you know what do they get 14 minutes or so with a patient they gave them something that they thought would help they were doing the the wrong thing for the right reasons but they believed that they were helping they didn't have they weren't get catching Financial incentives or okay got it that's right those people we need to educate them we need to train them on proper pain management opioid prescribing deprescribing and then you've got the tiny little group at the top of this if you will pyramid these are um docks doing the wrong thing for the wrong reasons these are bad docks these are your pill Mills the these are people breaking the law they need to go to jail end of um the thing is is that that little group at the top in the million or so Physicians we have in this country it represents such a small representation but it got blown out by the media and everybody else particularly those docs doing the right thing for the right reasons got caught up in it and engendered huge amount of fear huge amount of fear on the physician side and then what happened is the docs just started abandoning patients they cut their patients off um I had a young housewife two young kids uh doc Cut Her Off from a

know um California great state of California tried an experiment where they monitor death certificates in our state for and the docs prescribing opioids for that and uh they went after the docs thinking that if they targeted the docs doing that it would lead to a reduce a reduction in opioid deaths it led to a doubling I know counterintuitive because what happened is the docs abandon the patients and so we have to be aware of the negative consequences of this now the current I'm not trying to minimize the opioid crisis because it's real but we also now need to put some context the opioid crisis is being driven by the illicit fenel it is more if you just look at the CDC data it's very clear that the fenel coming in Via Mexico China and others uh is what driving most of the deaths um Keith um getting back to Keith led a beautiful uh Lance at Stanford Commission on the North American opioid crisis and put together a very rational plan I just finished serving as a senior adviser to the medical board of California where we revised our prescribing guidelines here they were very Draconian before hard limits made people fearful both patients and docs and we've shifted it back over to put the control back in the hands of the physician patient relationship uh we're hoping it'll make a difference you can see I'm I'm uh I'm going on a bit here there's there's just huge complexity in this space uh I understand you're going to do an episode you know some some time on it in the future and I hope the audience has more opportunity to listen to this other questions I can

            "text": "katum and I've never taken it uh the experience was the following I started learning about it hearing about it uh from listeners on the podcast realized by doing a little bit of a web search that it's available over the counter and that certain people like to take it often like every day at low doses or even higher Doses and that there was huge variation in terms of the amount of katom in the various products and how much people were taking some people talking about katom as something was as if it were innocuous and we can ask whether or not indeed it is innocuous and so I put out a a tweet I guess now that it Twitter is called X I guess I put out an X anyway doesn't matter and I and I said that my um first pass view of the literature on katum the scientific literature is that you know it had a lot of property similar to opioids although different as well and that it seemed kind of odd and maybe even problematic that it was so widely available and I got bombarded with um I don't want to call them katum enthusiasts because what I soon discovered was that these people um were angry with me for um placing even a partial Shadow on katum but what was interesting to me was that they were saying that in their case and I'm assuming they were telling the truth that katum had helped them get off prescription opioids and that they heavily rely on katum in various do levels of dosage um in ways that they felt really help them and so two things happen one I've been put in the crosshairs of the pro Crum Community not not to a a severe extent but perhaps the more important thing is and I want to thank that Community uh in part for you know now it's inspired me to do a deep dive search on katum I'm going to be interviewing one of the Laboratories that's done a lot of the research on katum later in uh 2024 but also it it's made me realize like there are these compounds that are available over the counter that many people feel feel so passionately about because they really feel like it's helped them I'm not saying it has I'm not saying it hasn't but then again I've never taken it what is katum at or perhaps what receptors does it tickle and what are your thoughts about katum and people using katum and maybe I'm pronouncing it wrong I've also heard Crome I'm calling it katum yeah uh katum is this natural substance that does have as you said opiod deric um properties as well as others that is not fully understood it's been available well naturally for many many years brought in to the United States and I've heard the same stories and I just want you to be prepared that anything I say about katum there's going to be some angry people after this and it is what it is um I have heard the same stories that you have heard about people taking katum and saying it's helping them to stay off of uh prescription opioids or elicit opioids and and I get that I think in some way it's binding opioid receptors and reducing the uh natural craving for these other substances and it makes perfect sense a methadone does that buprenorphine which I didn't mention before but is a is an interesting opioid that U binds to these receptors and it reduces craving um where I have challenges is in uh just because something is natural doesn't mean that it is safe we are seeing an increased number of Overdose deaths associated with katum um is it poly substance yeah in some cases it is but I think there's a lot we don't know so so poly substance people taking katum but also alcohol uh benzos getting back to the benzos um personal uh I think we need to put a lot of research into this agent and if it merits it I think it should be a uh a prescribed substance I think part of the challenge that we have is that we don't understand the quality the Purity the dose that people are taking of this thing uh you know similar type of story with cannabis by the way uh so I'm hoping that we're going to get the research that we need to really understand what it's doing and whether it is safe and effective I'm left with a lot of unknowns right now you mentioned cannabis is cannabis effective and by extension is CBD effective for managing pain yeah there's another controversial one you'll get a few comments about whatever I say you know in general listeners of this podcast yes they tell us where they're upset they'll also tell us where they agree um our goal here is never to um satisfy everybody but just to you know some of this lands in the in the realm of Highly Educated opinion um some of it is still as you pointed out speculation because we don't really know what Crum sources people are taking or cannabis Etc but um I think you'll find and my experience has been that um people appreciate that we're having the conversation and we do read all the comments and those comments often as I mentioned in my earlier anecdote about that tweet um often direct us to explore things further and we can always have a you know second discussion about this down the line so we invite all your comments and criticism cannabis well here's what we know in carefully controlled laboratory situations cannabis has been shown to reduce neuropathic pain that's that nerve related pain from people who have either nerve injury uh diabetic neuropathy uh postoptic neuralgia terrible burning nerve pain condition it has been shown to reduce that in small samples from larger scale epidemiology studies and even larger like Clinic based studies that I've done we find it has not been particularly helpful on average compared to people not on uh cannabis there's a lot we don't know about the causality of that and the direction of it but all to say that there are um many many questions that remain um I think the challenge that I personally have is that we're running huge population level experiments as we speak right now by you know providing unfettered use of cannabis and the bad news is is that we're probably going to see some real untour consequences of it and we're already are um the good news is I'm hoping that at a state level we'll be able to use that data to really inform um what's going on with cannabis I mean some of the challenges are what I referred to with catom uh cannabis is not cannabis is not cannabis you the THC to CBD ratios the dose yes all of that we don't know what you're getting it remains a scheduled One Drug by the DEA um I uh in some of my leadership roles and others have called for scheduling of it as a schedule to why why not to purpose try to restrict use but by making it a schedule to drug you've now made it so much easier to research uh I don't know if people understand how many barriers there are to scientists studying schedule one drugs could you explain schedule one versus schedule two thank you yeah so schedule the scheduling of drugs is a categorization that describes their abuse liability and so you have drugs like PCP heroin um cannabis which are schedule one which are defined as having high addiction potential and no uh utility which is just wild because when I think about PCP Fen cycline I certainly don't want people to run out and start taking PCP but chemically and physiologically PCP is ever so similar to ketamine and you know rarely is this discussed but ketamine is now uh widely used as a therapeutic presumably ketamine isn't schedule two um maybe even schedule three yes and so some of the the the stuff that's thrown into schedule one makes no sense it's historical it's all his it's decades and decades ago of history and clearly cannabis should not be a schedule one hands down no question uh by scheduling it though you will have the societal benefit of being able to make it more easy to study and then you get the NIH and the FDA into this and we can start really getting answers to the questions which I do I think it works at the end of the day do I think there is some variation of cannabis THC CBD ratios that will provide some benefit oh absolutely there's too many receptors in our brain that are involved with modulation of pain I just don't know what those are um a friend of mine uh uh Mark Wallace uh runs pain at UC San Diego has come up with a really nice recipe cocktail of ratios of THC to CBD that he feels very strongly that he can help people um using that as an active agent yeah I know that in uh Colorado there's a strain of cannabis where they it's pure CBD no THC I think they call it Charlotte's Web and parents of children with intractable epilepsy will actually move to the state of Colorado in order to get it because it seems to be effective for the treatment of certain forms of pediatric epilepsy that was shared with me with one of our colleagues Nolan Williams when he was a guest on the podcast so these plant-based compounds have have their place whether or not it's katum perhaps right we're remaining open about that or cannabis the T the THC or the CBD or some combination I think it's really interesting I think as long as we're talking about plant compounds how do you "

            "text": "problems and recall what we talked about is you know this is no susception these are the signals coming up to the brain once it hits the brain you know we're dealing with everything that person has lived through and also is currently experiencing meaning their levels of anxiety depression how they cope with pain in the past how they cope with it now uh early uh life experiences it's a paper that just came out in jamama uh literally in the last few days where they did a metaanalysis of brain Imaging studies on people with early adverse life events and what they found is abnormalities in emotional processing emotional functioning and people who have these um giving strong evidence that what happens to you early in life impacts us as adults and stays with us it changes our wiring now this is where in part pain psychologists behavioral therapists can come in they can help with some of the uh maladaptive coping the the thought processes involved with pain they can help teach skills so for the vast majority of pain psychology this is not your typical psychoanalytic lying on a couch you know talking about you know whatever this is about teaching people skills um incredibly helpful uh does it eliminate pain um few of the things that we do actually eliminate pain what we're trying to do is Chip Away you know a little bit with this medication a little bit with this Pro some this procedure bit with psychology we're trying to hit all of these Pathways in aggregate um to make a real difference the pain psychologist use classically techniques like cognitive behavioral therapy which involves often recognizing these unhelpful thoughts and patterns that we all get into around pain and even life to inter interrupting those thoughts to helping people again with goal setting and pacing to teach people relaxation techniques through deep breathing um things like biof feedback um in Silicon Valley where I practice the engineers love the biof feedback I'm an engineer by formal training so I get it but it's that Clos Loop feedback because remember the the brain is controlling the periphery and controlling the sympy sythetic nervous system and when we're in pain our sympathetic nervous system gets revved up when the sympathetic nervous system gets reved up blood vessels constrict uh heart rate goes up our muscles get tense um and we need sometimes ways of learning how to calm down that sympathetic nervous system um cognitive behavoral therapy mindfulness based stress reduction acceptance and commitment therapy are some of the tools that they use my partner Beth has developed a brief intervention called empowered relief yes I'm biased um it works we've studied this in an NIH uh funded study and it's a way of getting eight weeks of cogni behavioral therapy in two hours wow not meant to replace CBT but as an additional tool and you're going to see as time goes by more and more of these tools come out and the beauty of them is they're going to be much e easier to disseminate broadly to the public than for instance a pill you know I can't we can't just go put into FedEx or the US Post Office you know start sending out pills to everybody but we can develop treatments online that uh can teach people skills and really help is that the plan for this um abbreviated but equally effective cognitive behavioral therapy yes now you're getting into kind of my beths in mind my life mission so you know I've spent the last 12 years building a uh digital platform a health platform that we've integrated into clinics and capture highquality data covering all aspects of people's physical psychological and social functioning and the reason for that is to address a critical need that we have on better quality data about people the data and the information that we have on people with pain and many health conditions is terrible and so I created this platform to be able to capture high quality data put it to use use AI in the background for prediction and now Beth has created these brief interventions which we're integrating and the notion is to make that widely available for free we're giving it all away like I said this is a life mission we both have been blessed to be at Stanford where we have everything but you know you go just 30 miles 40 miles outside of the Bay Area and you're in a healthc care desert and I don't say that disparaging to any docs working out there but it's different there's only a handful of large academic centers and large practices in the country but you get outside those those catchment areas people struggle with how to get good quality care you asked that question earlier how do you find good quality care and so we're working to make that that available to everybody fantastic I was going to ask you as a final question what is your if you had one wish for the future of pain medicine and the treatment of pain what that would be um before you answer that "

            "text": "um I'll just add an answer that you already gave which is it sounds like the implementation of this um incredible set of tools and database that you've um collaborated with Dr Darnell Beth Darnell to uh to develop as at least one of them so now that that um that answer was given by me then you can it frees up uh the opportunity for you to give another answer what is the if you had one wish for the field of pain medicine uh going forward what what would that wish be yeah so a few years ago um I co-led for the country the development of the national pain strategy and this was uh sponsored by the NIH and health and human services and I co-led this with Dr Linda Porter from the NIH we brought together 80 uh National experts in pain research pain clinical care pain policy and people with lived experience with pain we put together a strategic plan for the country on how to enact a cultural transformation and change the way we assess uh care for people with pain how we educate professionals how we communicate with the public my wish would be for full implementation of the national pain strategy it unfortunately uh took backseat when it was released the same time with the CDC opioid guidelines and the opioid guidelines sucked all the oxygen out of the room but the the Strategic plan it was well thought out it's the one that we have for our country it's non-controversial nonpartisan it is motherhood and apple pie um and it's if we just actually Implement what we put forward it'll make a huge difference in the lives of people uh living with pain is there anything that people listening to this podcast can do to try and move the implementation of that initiative up are there Congress people to call I mean this how so I learned in junior high school and high school uh what little I attended and by the way go to school folks I had to catch up a lot but I do remember them saying that you know this was a democracy is a democracy and that um those phone calls and letters can often matter for what um gets you know sent up the flag pole and what ultimately gets approved and implemented beautifully stated you're you're absolutely right and in fact the nidus for the national pain strategy originally came about through a number of concerned citizens with pain doing that very thing and lobbying what became a bipartisan you don't hear that much anymore bipartisan effort um to put forward a national Pain Care Act that got put into the Affordable Care Act that called for the development of an Institute of medicine report on pain that led to the National pain strategy all starting with concerned people making those phone calls and writing those letters so that means means calling your congressman and congresswoman leaving messages I hear this works I mean I know people they're doing this for other initiatives um and one call two calls doesn't make much of a difference but that if people are saying um you know this is important to them that people in power eventually start taking action the the legislators they listen and and in part um Again part of this life mission both to develop this platform I've created a nonprofit um called pain USA and its main mission is to help Advance the implementation of the national pain strategy and baked within that is this platform also to use highquality data to better inform the care of patients of people with pain and to deliver high quality um treatments because we do know also that people listen to data and we need good quality data to influence uh those messages but please yes make those calls write those letters it does work well Sean Dr Mackey thank you so much for everything that you're doing you took us on quite a tour um in terms of depth and breadth of the thing that we think of and unfortunately in some cases experience as pain although we also learned it's highly adaptive in some cases can protect us does indeed protect us thank you for taking us on that tour of the biology the psychology the various treatments the context in which all of this exists we touched into some somewhat controver IAL areas but I really appreciate the thoroughness and the nuance and the sensitivity with which you touch into all of those issues and um just on behalf of myself and everybody listening I just really want to thank you you've um contributed a great deal today to the public education of what pain is what it isn't and how to treat it so thank you ever so much thank you Dr huberman I appreciate the opportunity to come on and spend some time and uh you're giving a platform to help educate and inform people out there I got to tell you Nobody Does it Better you you've been absolutely amazing and um thank you again thank you it's a labor of love and I appreciate the kind words come back again thank you thank you for joining me today for my discussion all about pain and ways to control pain with Dr Shawn Mackey I hope you found the conversation to be as interesting and as informative as I did to learn more about and explore some of "
