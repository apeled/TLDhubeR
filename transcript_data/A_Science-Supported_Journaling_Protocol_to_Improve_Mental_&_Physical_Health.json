            "text": "noticed that it is not a protocol that'slikely to feel very good at least not atfirst and indeed that's what theresearch shows and this is somethingthat you really need to be aware of thatwhen subjects are given this researchassignment during the assignment theyare often quite distraught often timesthey cry often times they findthemselves holding their breath andanxiety often times they'll finish that15 to 30 minute writing block andthey'll feel as if they had run a mentalmarathon and therefore the subjects weregiven a period of 5 to 15 minutes post-writing to settle down and transitionback into their day so I highlyrecommend that you incorporate that intoyour protocol as well so if you're goingto allow yourself say 20 minutes towrite you want to give yourself probably10 minutes of quiet time to you knowbring your composure back and resetyourself so that you can re-enter dailyliving because the writing that you'regoing to do for this particular protocolis designed to tap into very negative ifnot the most negative experiences ofyour life and so that's something to betaken seriously and it's an entirelyunreasonable expectation that you couldwrite about something as difficult asthe most difficult experience in yourlife and then simply pivot and go backinto everyday life right away so you'llwant to designate a time of day or nightperhaps when you can do this writing andstill allow yourself some time to youknow settle down your autonomic systemyou know return your breathing to normalperhaps you know wash your face withsome cool water remind yourself that therest of the day continues that you'redoing great in fact you made it throughthis first installment of the journalingexercise so you're probably starting toget the impression that this form ofjournaling that Penna Baker andcolleagues really researched andpioneered the evolution of is quitedifferent than other forms of journalingand in fact it's very different I'vealready told you that the idea is to sitdown and write for 15 to 30 minutesright continuously write about somethingthat really to you is one of the most ifnot the most difficult experiences ofyour life in addition to that for thisform of journaling to be most effectivethat is to bring about the greatestpositive shifts in mental and physicalhealth you're actually going to writeabout that exact same thing four timesnow the way that that was initiallyresearched by penne Baker and others wasto have the same person of course writeabout the same experience four times onfour consecutive days for 15 to 30minutes each so students or people fromthe general population or veterans wereliterally coming into the laboratory andsitting down and writing about the mostdifficult experience of their life thatthey could recall for 15 to 30 minuteson one day and then again on the nextday and then the next day and the nextday so much of the data on thisparticular journaling method reflectsthat four consecutive days of 15 to 30minute writing bouts of the mostdifficult experience that you canrecall however there have beenvariations on this protocol such thatpeople selected one day per week and itdoesn't even have to be the same daylike every Monday it could be Monday ofone week and then Wednesday of the nextweek and so on such that you write onlyone day per week about the mostdifficult experience you can recall andthen you write about that same difficultexperience one week later and then againone week later and then again one weeklater across the course of a month orany 4-we period for that matter now Idon't know about you but when I hearthat that I'm going to need to writeabout the most difficult experience ofmy entire life that I can recall foreven 15 minutes let alone 30 minutes letalone two times and here we're talkingabout four times perhaps even on fourconsecutive days that actually speaks tosome intensity some demand in fact Ifind myself kind of leaning away fromthat experience a little bit but aswe'll talk about later that's exactlythe point of this type of exercise whichis that we are harboring these storiesthese experiences and in some casespartial Recollections and in other casedetailed Recollections of the difficultthing that happened to us perhaps eventhe most difficult thing that happenedto us and those narratives exist in ournervous system these are not necessarilytraumas as we talked about beforealthough they can be traumas now we heara lot about trauma and these days peoplecall all sorts of things trauma andtraumatizing and say that they've beentraumatized by this or traumatized bythat there's actually a specificdefinition of trauma that was providedby Dr Paul kti who is some of you knowis a medical doctor and psychiatristhe's been a guest on this podcast firstto talk about trauma he wrote aexcellent book about trauma I provide alink to that book in the show notecaptions by the way and he and I didfour episodes of The hubman Lab podcasta So-Cal guest series specifically aimedat mental health what it is how to buildmental health specific protocols and DrPaul kti is really truly a world expertin trauma and he defines trauma as anyexperience or experiences plural thatmodify our brain and neural circuitry soit could be brain or body or both suchthat we do not function as wellemotionallybehaviorally or cognitively goingforward from that experience okay so noteverything constitutes a trauma but manythings do so applying that definition Ithink it's fair to say that many if notmost people have some form of traumastored in their nervous system and otherpeople perhaps don't have such traumasbut everyone has had stressors in fact Ithink it's fair to say that everyone hashad major stressors in their lifeprovided that they've lived it allthat's just part of life unfortunatelyor maybe fortunately maybe it makes uswho we are in positive ways if we areable to transmute those negativeexperiences and stressors or traumasinto particular forms of learning thatallow us to do better and indeed that'spossible and that was discussed withPaul kti in that four episode series onMental Health but the particular form ofjournaling that we're talking abouttoday was really designed to have peoplefocus on those difficult experiences andthen for four episodes total yes totalthere's no ongoing every week or youknow it's not like having to seek outsunlight every morning and gettingsunlight in your eyes or trying to getthe best possible night sleep at nightlike I'm always encouraging people to dothis is really a short-term protocol butit's

            "text": "low expressors and the high expressorsis that it's a non-trivial detail ofthis writing protocol because somepeople are very familiar withcommunicating their emotions both inwriting and perhaps in speech as welland this actually has been looked at uhthere's a wonderful study also by penneBaker and colleagues and I shouldmention that even though he studiedthese journaling protocol for a goodnumber of years his laboratory hasevolved now to studying all sorts ofthings related to how the particularlanguage usage patterns that people usein everyday speech as well as in theirwriting how that reflects theirunderlying psychological tone andemotions but also and I find this sointeresting how the particular wordsthat we use in writing and speechactually shape in a causal way ouremotional state so I'll talk a littlebit about that later but the importantthing to focus on now is the results ofthis study entitled natural emotionvocabularies as Windows on stress andwell-being and this again is a studythat was done by pen Baker andcolleagues I've linked to it in the shownote captions and it essentiallyexamines people's natural language usagepatterns now what do I mean by naturaland why is that important well therehave been many many studies of people'svocabulary and assessing whether or notpeople have more knowledge of negativewords to describe negative emotions orpositive emotions these studies arevarying in their form but generallyconsist of having people Circle wordsthey recognize or maybe writing out thedefinitions to and it turns out thatpeople that have more extensiveknowledge of words that describenegative emotions themselves tend tohave a lower affect or negativeemotional state as compared to peoplewho have more extensive knowledge ofvocabulary words that pertain topositive emotions so a crude example ofwhat I just described is somebody thathas fairly limited knowledge of wordsthat describe positive emotional statesso perhaps they recognize the word happythey recognize the word ecstatic theyrecognize the word joyful but they havea fairly limited word set that pertainsto positive emotions whereas bycomparison this is always relativewithin the same person right bycomparison the person knows four timesmore words that pertain to a negativeemotional state okay in general thosepeople tend to be more depressive tendto have higher levels of anxiety and soforth as compared to somebody where thereverse pattern is true where they haveknowledge of far more words that pertainto positive emotional states as comparedto negative emotional states now on theface of it that result probably seemsstraightforward right people that have alot of words to describe happiness aremore happy people that have a lot ofwords to describe sadness and negativeemotions are more sad but it didn'tnecessarily have to be that way and itturns out that it's not always that waywhat do I mean by that well theparticular study that I've beendescribing here this natural emotionvocabularies as Windows on distress andwell-being is an important paper becauseit explored not the words that peoplehave knowledge of but the word patternsthat people tend to use in their naturalspeech either spoken or written and whatpen Baker and others showed is thatpeople that tend to use a lot ofnegative words tend to have morenegative emotional states whereas peoplethat naturally tend to use words thatdescribe positive emotional states havemore positive emotions and this relatedto both mental and and physical metricsof negative emotions and positiveemotions so this is a significant resultbecause what it says is that ourknowledge of vocabulary words is whileinteresting and perhaps important forother things is not nearly as importantas which particular words we use on afrequent basis and so whereas before Isaid okay if you're going to embark onthis protocol of four writing sessions15 to 30 minutes each that you shouldnot monitor your writing that you wantto sit down start writing and just don'tstop you don't want to pay attention togrammar or spelling or anything else andthen after the fourth writing sessionyou don't look at what you've writtenfor at least a week but then a week ormore later you go back and you read whatyou've written paying careful attentionto the number of words that you use thatreflect a negative emotional or affectas it's sometimes called state in thefirst versus the second versus the thirdversus the fourth journal entry now thismight seem a little bit uh detailed andreductionist for a protocol that wewould discuss on this podcast here we'rereally talking about you doing your owndata analysis of self but if you thinkabout it a practice like this both canbe very quick and highly informative sofor instance you can go back and simplyCircle all the words that at first blushto you appear to reflect a negativeState and put a square around all thewords that just by your read seem toreflect a positive State and thencompare them across those four journalentries and of course you can opt to notdo any of this but what people find thatis what was discovered in the researchliterature is that on average thepatterns of language use from the 1 tothe 4th entury shift dramatically suchthat by the 4th entury people eventhough they're still writing about thesame negative experience are writingabout that experience in a verydifferent way not only are theynaturally using fewer negative words todescribe their recollection andexperience experience of that negativeevent but the number of positive wordsis also increasing now this is importantbecause when pen Baker and colleagues"

qualitypeer-reviewed studies of this protocolhave been carried out and are stillongoing not just in pennebakerlaboratory but in many many otherLaboratories as well reveal that thepositive physical shifts that occur inpeople that complete this for bouts ofwriting in the way I described is bothsignificant and longlasting now ofcourse it is not the case that thesefour episodes of writing can completelycure major forms of depression or post-trumatic stress disorder although theyhave been shown to benefit that is toreduce depressive symptoms and to reducethe symptoms of post-traumatic stressdisorder considerably but they shouldn'tbe considered complete Therapeutics forthose conditions however however theyhave been shown to significantly improvemany other health metrics and I alludedto some of these at the beginning oftoday's episode there have for instancebeen studies of this type of journalingprotocol for people that have beensuffering from chronic anxiety andinsomnia and indeed they experiencedsignificantrelief as well people who have sufferedfrom arthritis people who are goingthrough cancer treatment people who haveLupus which is an autoimmune disorderreport significantly improved symptomsnot necessarily cured from thoseconditions but significantly improvedsymptoms as a consequence of doing thiswriting protocol in addition and earlierI mentioned this I realized but I'llmention again people suffering fromfibromyalgia which is a chronic paincondition that is or can be verydebilitating has shown significantImprovement in symptomology that isreduced chronic pain after they do thisfour bouts of writing in the way that Idescribed and again the relief from painseems to be ongoing again not a totalcure of their symptoms I don't want touh provide false hope here or overblowthe um the positive impact of thisparticular writing protocol butnonetheless statistically significantshifts that were pervasive over time inaddition people suffering from IBS orirritable bowel syndrome have achievedsome significant degree of relief oftheir symptoms relative to people whoalso have irritable bowel syndrome butwho do not do the exact same protocolthat we're talking about today now ofcourse in all of these studies we're nottalking about people that simply do thiswriting protocol as compared to peoplethat don't do the writing protocolpennebaker and others of course areexcellent scientists and so they provideadequate control conditions the controlconditions in most cases were to havepeople also do 15 to 30 minutes ofwriting but to do journaling in the moreconventional manner of autobiographicalreport of what they've been up to latelyor what they plan to do in fact verymuch like my journal entries fromcollege and uh in the subsequent to thatso it's important to understand thatwhat we're talking about today is ajournaling protocol which seems somewhatconventional but the exact protocol ishighly unusual as we've been talkingabout throughout today's episode and inaddition all of the data that we'rediscussing in terms of positive mentaland physical effects are data that wereestablished relative that is arestatistically significant as compared toa control group that also wrote for anequivalent amount of time time tended towrite out an equivalent number of wordson average and yet we're writing aboutsomething quite different than thepeople that were in the so-calledexperimental group so it's important tokeep in mind that we're not simplytalking about phenomenology here we'retalking about scientific studies wherevery specific measurements of theexperimental group that is the groupthat did this particular form of writingabout something very distressing or eventraumatic four times 15 to 30 minutesper time relative to a control groupthat did nearly the equ equivalent formof mechanical processes of writing butthat the specific emotional contentrelated to that writing was the majorvariable that differed in fact that isone particular strength of the protocolwe're describing today that if you thinkabout it would be very hard to do in astudy say of physical exercise where youhave people perhaps you know run on atreadmill getting their heart rate up to85% of their maximum heart rate for 30minutes 5 days a week you would expectthat that group compared to a group thatdid nothing would experiencesignificantly greater shifts in positiveHealth metrics like lowered bloodpressure certainly not during theexercise bout during the exercise boutyou can bet that their blood pressureand heart rate went way way up but thatof course afterwards they would adapt tothat exercise by having a resting heartrate that was lower than any group thatdid nothing or that walked on atreadmill but it's actually very hard tothink about a control group that wouldprovide real equivalents of time spentand effort spent but that would differonly on one variable which would beheart rate you could probably come upwith something but it'd be verydifficult to do whereas in the studiesthat we're talking about during today'sepisode essentially everything was thesame right people are still writingthey're still sitting they're stilldoing it for the same amount of timeit's simply that the content of thewriting is different at the level of theemotional tone of the subject thatthey're writing about which I find bothexciting and personally quite motivatingto do the sort of protocol that I'vedescribed today because it leads to suchdramatic shift in health across a hugerange of Dimensions both in peoplesuffering from certain conditions andpeople who are not suffering fromcertain conditions and then the questionbecomes why what is actually happeningat a physiological level that canexplain all of these incrediblepsychological and physical positiveshifts that occur okay so as with anyprotocol that's shown in many many"

bejust one thing however there are somegeneral categories of physiologicalchanges that have been observed inpeople that do the particular protocolwe're talking about today that I thinkcan explain a great number of the mentaland physical shifts that occur now oneof the more important studies in thisarea that's been published and hereagain this is a paper by jimes pen Bakerbut I don't want to give the impressionthat he's the only person or the onlylaboratory that's looked at thisparticular writing protocol many othershave as well and I'll provide links tosome of those in the show note captionsbut this particular study I'm about todescribe explored how the disclosure oftraumas or the writing out of verystressfulexperiences can impact immune functionat the level of specific cell types ofour immune system that are challengedin a way that mimics the sort ofchallenge we would experience if we wereto be exposed to a bacteria or virus nowwithout getting into a detailed lectureabout immunology and by the way I did anentire episode of The hubman Lab podcastabout immune function in the brain uhsome years ago and you can find that bygoing to HUB lab.com just put immunesystem into the search function it willtake you to that episode and to anytimestamps of other episodes where Itouch on the immune system or protocolsrelated to immune brain function in themeantime this particular study is veryinteresting and worth highlightingbecause what they did was to essentiallyhave people do the exact same protocolthat we've been describing throughouttoday's episode but they also includedblood draws from the subjects in thoseexperiments and they collected thatblood from subjects both before andafter the writing episodes in fact theytook the blood 15 weeks prior to thestudy and again six weeks into the studyokay now keep in mind that people werecompleting the writing exercise over thecourse of at a maximum four weeksbut they were still monitoring thesesubjects in terms of their psychologicaland physical health after the finalwriting exercise that was a keycomponent of essentially all of thestudies of this particular protocolthey'd assess people before they did thewriting assignment they assessed peopleduring the writing assignment and theyassess people often long after thewriting assignment was completed evenyears after the writing assignment wascompleted so in this particularexperiment they're drawing blood 15weeks before and 6 weeks into the studysix weeks into the study is after all ofthe writing that is the four bouts ofwriting have been completed they alsodivided subjects in this study intopeople that were so-called highdisclosers so these are people thatrevealed a lot about their particulartraumatic or stressful episode in theirwriting and people that were lowdisclosers they also included a controlgroup and the control group wasessentially as I described before itconsisted of people that also were doingjournaling for the equivalent amount oftime as people that were in theexperimental group but that we're notwriting about a traumatic or stressfulexperience now the basic takeaway of thestudy is as follows they take the bloodthey are able to isolate from the bloodsomething called t-lymphocytest-lymphocytes are an essential componentof your immune system these are cellsthat many people describe as white bloodcells they are manufactured in the bonemarrow which I still find amazing rightwe think of bone is just these like youknow hard components of our body and ourskeleton that allow us to be upright andto be rigid and to move about and youknow not be um you know jelly like butindeed in the center of the bone ismarrow and the marrow itself isperforming an important physiologicalrole many roles in fact one of which isto create these t-lymphocytes or whiteblood cells they actually are born ofthe bone marrow but then they mature ina structure called the thymus the thymusis an organ that sits essentially behindyour sternum and it's there that thecells that originate from the bonemarroware matured into what are effectivelywhite blood cells which are essentiallycells that go out and combat infectionsbacterial infections viral infectionseven fungal infections now they combatinfection not alone but in collaborationwith other immune cell types that youcan learn about again in that episodethat I did about the immune system andthe nervous system if you choose to golisten to it and even if you don'there's what you need to know about thisstudy in this study what they foundis that when they took the blood fromthese subjects isolated those Tlymphocytes and then challenged thoset-lymphocytes with something that mimicsan infection and they did that withsomething called con canavalin aconcavalin a is what's considered aogenit's something that activatest-lymphocytes and it activates what arecalled natural killer cells now that's alot of detail for sake of this episodebasically what the con canavalin a isdoing is it's mimicking an in sectionbut in this particular study this is allbeing done on t-lymphocytes that havebeen collected they're put into a dishand then they're exposed to differentconcentrations going from low to mediumto high of that con canavalin amimicking a lowgrade moderate or severeinfection and what they observed in thisstudy is remarkable I mean to me it thisjust still blows my mind people that didthis four bouts of writing protocolexperienced greater degree of tlmyactivation from The concanavalin mitogenChallenge which mimics infection thendid people who wrote about somethingthat wasn't stressful or traumatic nowthat itself is pretty striking if youthink about it I mean we're talkingabout a writing exercise that generatesan emotional state versus a writingexercise that does not produce asnegative or intense an emotional stateand we're talking about a significanteffect on the immune system or themobilization of immune cells in responseto an immunechallenge in addition to that howeverthey observed that high disclosers thatis people that really poured themselvesinto this writing protocol experienced agreater degree of immune activation thatis a fighting off response to thismitogen concanavalin a then did peoplethat were low disclosers so this reallyspeaks to the fact that the intensitythe emotional state during the writingexercise is having a significant impacton the immune system at the level ofsomething as basic and yet as powerfulas how much deployment of immuneresponse there is to an infection nowthe field of so-called psychonneuroimmunology has been around for morethan 30 years in fact if you don't applystandard definitions to that field it'sbeen around for thousands of years butreally it's only in the last 10 years orso that scientists and physicians atleast standard scientists and Physicianshave started to really adopt theunderstanding and really apply to theirstudies and their clinical practice thisfirm idea that the body and mind arelinked in this way that emotions canreally shape our physical responses andthat physical responses also can shapeof course our mental responses now I'mnot trying to be disparaging at all oftraditional science or medicine it'sjust that until recently these fieldshave existed more or less as silospeople that studied bodily organs versuspeople that studied the brain peoplethat studied emotions and psychologyversus people that studied the immunesystem and there's been some crossoverbut by and large it's been very siloednow I mention this because if you lookinto the history of why James pennebakerand colleagues started exploring thisparticular pattern of journaling itactually relates to his own personalexperience and I don't want to spend toomuch time on this but it's worthmentioning that pener has actuallyspoken about and written about in by theway an excellent book that I've linkedto in the show note captions where hetalks about his experience in sufferingpretty severely from asthma as a childand that that asthma was seasonal andyet at some point later in his lifebecause he had certain relativesvisiting him in his new homelocation that his asthma would come andgo as a consequence of interacting withcertain members of his familyindependent of season and basically whathe deduced from his own personalexperience is that there must be somelink between our emotions eithernegative or positive and our immunesystem or other physical ailments orthriving in the physical sense now hecertainly wasn't the first one to comeup with that hypothesis but indeed hewas one of the first to really startexploring a protocol within thelaboratory an experimental protocol thatcould really tap into high degrees ofemotionality in this case negativeemotions and the consequence of that onphysical health outcomes and this studythat I mentioned is but one one of thoseexamples and in that way he's truly aPioneer in thinking about quote unquotepsychon neuroimmunology but couching itnot in the direction that most people dowhich is for instance there have beenlots of studies where people have saidokay in people that are chronicallystressed which includes of coursepsychological stress what are theeffects on the nervous system the immunesystem Etc and as you could imagine ingeneral people who were more stressedover long long periods of time had worsephysical outcomes and people who wereless stressed had better physicaloutcomes but the protocol that we'retalking about today is quite a bitdifferent so if you step back and thinkabout it's a little counterintuitivewhat pennebaker essentially did was tohavepeople deliberately induce a negativeexperience and yet they're seeingpositive physical health outcomes or inthis case positive effects on immunesystem function so that leads to thequestion of what's really happeningduring an after these four episodes ofwriting and that's where things getespecially interesting as it relates tothe nervous system system and toneuroplasticity or the nervous system'sability to rewire itself in response toexperience so that's what we're going totalk about next I'd like to take a quickbreak and thank our sponsor insid"

differentchanges occurring at the level of themind or body but what we're talkingabout here is trying to find the pivotalone or sometimes referred to as theLynch pin mechanism that when one Tapsinto that mechanism it Wicks out intoall these different systems of the brainand body and provides all of thesedifferent positive benefits now inresearching this episode I thought longand hard about this and came up with ashort list of ideas and as is always thecase people have worked in this area onthis particular protocol and protocolssimilar to it in the the field ofPsychology and Neuroscience have alsogenerated their own short list and thoseshort lists converge at the level of oneparticular mechanism that is worthdescribing and that one particularmechanism is anchored around the conceptof neuroplasticity that is our nervoussystems ability to change in response toexperience and if you've heard me talkabout neuroplasticity beforeneuroplasticity in childhood occursthrough rather passive experience of anysorts of events in fact one of theHallmarks of childhood is that just themere exposure to an experience reshapesthe brain not necessarily permanentlybut often in a way that is verylonglasting now that's a feature ofchildhood because if you think aboutwhat the nervous system is reallydesigned to do for us it's of coursewhat allows us to move our limbs it'swhat allows us to have a heart rate thatgoes in the background without us havingto think about it so-called autonomicfunctions it's what keeps us breathingwithout us having to think about it andon and on but one of the main functionsof the nervous system is to be apredictive machine to make good guessesabout what's to come next and one of theways to make really good guesses aboutwhat's to come next is to take a certainperiod of life that we call childhoodsuperimpose on that period of life thatchildhood what we call a critical periodor sensitive period during which ourexperiences create a sort of map withinus that allow us to predict okay well ifthis person's in the room later wellthen that's likely to happen or if thosepeople are in the room any number ofdifferent things could happen but of oneparticular category of experience asopposed to another that's really whatyour nervous system does it becomes aprediction machine and it becomes aprediction Machine by drawing strongcorrelations between emotional statesyour physical surroundings yourperception of who's there what's therewhat happened just prior to somethingand how it made you feel later so whenwe talk about recounting a stressful ortraumatic event if you recall there werethree components to it it involved factsabout that experience so literally whowas there what happened as to the bestof our recollection if you recall thesecond thing it's also about recountinghow that experience made you feel at thetime and how it makes you feel now andthen if you recall the third thingthat's critical to include it's aboutany links or associations between whathappened and really anything at all soif you think about it all three of thosethings in that list are really abouttapping into your neural map or yourschema as it's sometimes called or yourinternal representation both consciousand unconscious of what happened duringthat stressful or traumatic event now aHallmark feature of traumas as well as aHallmark feature of addictions as wellas a Hallmark feature of compulsivebehaviors or negative habitual behaviorsand negative habitual States likechronic stress anxiety the sorts ofthings that trigger insomnia the sortsof states of body that trigger immunecompromise and give us autoimmune orother types of immune system challengesare that a certain component of ournervous system and our brain inparticular are less engaged than theynormally would be in the healthycondition now I want to be clear that inany one of these conditions whether ornot it's irritable bowel syndrome orit's fibromyalgia or it's chronicanxiety or depression there are manymany different brain centers andnetworks that is stations within thenervous system of the brain and bodythat are involved I really want toemphasize this there's no one locationin the brain for instance for fear oranxiety it's always a network phenomenonthe relative activation of differentbrain centers at different times and soon but with respect to thinking abouttraumas and stressful experiences wehave to ask ourselves what is it aboutthe emotional states and all the mappingthe representation around thoseemotional experiences that would somehowimpact our immune system like our thymusof all things or our bone marrow orconversely what would it be about astressful experience that would impactour heart rate that would somehow thenalso change our brain so the mechanismthat seems to be a sort of Smoking Gunof sorts that is the mechanism thatreally does seem to be at least one ofthose Lynch pin mechanisms is that whenwe experience very stressful ortraumatic experiences our prefrontalcortex the neural real estate that'sjust behind our forehead which hasseveral different subdivisions in factis reduced in its overall levels ofactivity and other areas of the brainthat sometimes are referred to as thelimit LIC areas of the brain although ifwe were to be more accurate than thatthe modern Neuroscience really refers tothese as subcortical structures theyaren't necessarily lyic structures perse although they can include componentsof the lyic system so they can includethings like the hypothalamus so thisdense collection of neurons that residesover the roof of your mouth that'sinvolved in things like aggression ortemperature regulation sleep wake cyclesand so on as well as structures thatperhaps you've heard more about such asthe amygdala which is involved in threatdetection but other structures as wellall of which are subcord cortical nowthose subcortical structures can becompared in a fairly General but stillaccurate way to the prefrontal cortexwhich is involved in contextual planninginvolved in assessing outcomes if I do awhat will happen if I do B what willhappen the prefrontal cortex is alsoassociated with ourself-concept of our identity who we arewhat we are about what we value whatmotivates our decisions to do or to notdo things so I don't want to create anyfalse impressions that the prefrontalcortex is somehow a more evolvedstructure than the subcortical and lyicstructures but in some sense it is it'sinvolved in more quote unquotesophisticated functions or at leastfunctions that involve us reallythinking and being able to place acoherent Narrative of what happened inthe past what's happening now and what'slikely to happen in the future ifconditions a b or c happen to arise okayso that's a very brief top level Contourless in prefrontal cortical function andcomparing it a bit to some subcorticaland lyic structure functions now therehave been neuroimaging studies in"

the way up to 120 we know thatneuroplasticity is created when thenervous system goes into states that areatypical as compared to our normalwaking States and one of the keytriggers for neuroplasticity is when wehave high levels of the so-calledcatacol amines dopamine epinephrineEndor norepinephrine in our brain andbody that creates a state change that wecall autonomic nervous system shiftwhere we

to change and theactual rewiring occurs during deep sleepsleep and states such as non-sleep deeprest or anytime we're in a deeprelaxation State some of you have heardme talk about neuroplasticity before butthe key elements to remember for today'sdiscussion is that these states ofheightened levels of emotionality arethe trigger for neuroplasticity and thatthe actual rewiring of

how could it be that thenegative experience on the one handcreates problems and then on the otherhand recreating that negative experiencerelieves those very same problemsthere's something completely illogicalabout that framework right well here'swhere things get really interestingthere have been two separate collectionsof work in the Psychology andNeuroscience literature in the last 10years which have focused mainly on twoconcepts the first concept is thatextremely stressful and traumaticexperiences because they induce arelative reduction in the activity inthe prefrontal cortexdivorce our mind from creating acoherent structural narrative about whathappened during those particularepisodes and in doing so create a sortof confusion about responsibility nowthere's a whole discussion to be hadabout this and we will have thatdiscussion in a future episode of thepodcast about how trauma is actuallymapped within the brain and body thereare a lot of theories about this rightsometimes we hear that it's all mappedwithin the body sometimes we hear it'sall mapped within the brain turns out asis almost always the case it's both butthere does seem to be bothneuroscience-based and psychology bothclinical and research psychology basedevidence for the idea that when peopleexperience very stressful and traumaticevents that the representation of thoseevents is somewhat fractured in thesense that people by not talking aboutthem by not creating a coherentnarrative around them start to formfalse correlations between the kind ofstress that they create in our body andmind when we think about them and aconfusion about what happened aconfusion about why we feel terriblewhen maybe we weren't the perpetrator orcreate a sort of lack of coherencebetween our bodily State and what we'rethinking especially because we're notthe perpetrator right here we're talkingabout traumas and stressful things thathappened to us maybe we wereparticipants in that by virtue of ourcircumstances but when we talk abouttraumas what we're really talking aboutare things that we would have neverelected to do otherwise okay so I don'twant to be too abstract about this butagain within the neuroscience andpsychology understanding of trauma andstress it seems that there's a lack ofcoherence about the narrative there'salso a mismatch between the bodily Stateand thoughts about that experience andthere seems to be a confusion about whoor what was responsible for inducingthat negative state in a way that insome sense causes people to set asidethat narrative and try and push it awayand not think about it because it isconfusing it can often even bediscombobulating for those that havesuffered from very stressful events andTrauma I think some of this willresonate with you now a separateliterature that's largely nested justwithin the Neuroscience Communityalthough it's starting to Wick out intothe psychology Community as well is theidea that when people tell the truth andin particular when people tell the truthwith a very coherent structurednarrative the levels of activity in theprefrontal cortex increase but not justtemporarily that is that there'sneuroplasticity of these prefrontalcortical structures which are bothinvolved in generating coherentnarratives but are also involved in thisis super important that are alsoinvolved in regulating the activity ofthose subcortical structures like thehypothalamus and lyic structures inother words that when we can increaseour understanding of an event when wecan understand why certain emotionsarose what our role in it really waswhat others roles in that particularevent were well then by incre ining theactivity of the prefrontal cortex it'sbetter both in that moment and goingforward to regulate the activity ofthese other subcortical structures and Ithink one of the more impressive"

            "text": "experiments within that whole field oflinking prefrontal activity totruth-telling is an experiment that waspublished a few years ago in theproceedings of the National Academy ofSciences entitled increasing honesty inhumans with non-invasive brainstimulation now this is a veryartificial scenario where people comeinto the laboratory and they have peopledo what is essenti a die rolling gamethey roll dice okay so they're rollingDice and then after they roll the diceonly they can see the score that theyget with those Dice and then a number ispresented on a screen and they have toreport whether or not the die roll thatthey did matches or does not match thenumber that's presented on the screenand if it does match then they get amonetary award and the monetary award isnot huge but it's not insignificanteither for each die roll where theymatch the number that's presented on thescreen they get the equivalent of andbecause this experiment was done inSwitzerland nine Swiss Franks which atthe time of the study correspondedroughly to $9 and today corresponds toroughly$10 so they do this repeatedly and so insome sense the subjects in theseexperiments are in a place to make notan enormous amount of money but againnot an insignificant amount either nowhere's the key component of the studythe statistics of the dice that theyroll and the statistics of die rollingand the numbers that they arepresented make sure that there can onlybe a correct match on average 50% of thetime okay and in this experiment thesubjects are asked to report entirely onthe honor System what they got when theyrolled the dice and what one finds inthis study and other studies that havebeen done subsequent to it is that whenyou take everyday people so you take menand women you take a broad age rangeyou're not selecting for sociopathsyou're not selecting for people in onegiven profession or another pick yourfavorite profession if you were toassume any one given profession has lesshonest people than others they collectpeople from all sorts of walks of lifeand people report getting the samenumber that is presented to them that isa match about 68% of the time whichmeans they are not Faithfully reportingwhat happened now Nur Imaging studiesshow that when people lie certain areasof the frontal cortex increase in theiractivity although the major effect whenone looks neurally is a reduction in theprefrontal cortex and in particularsubcompartments of the prefrontal cortexthat we'll talk about in a moment andthis particular study entitledincreasing honesty in humans withnon-invasive brainstimulation as the name suggests usednon-invasive brain stimulation so thisis transcranial magnetic stimulationwhich is a really nice and convenienttool because you don't have to drilldown through the skull you can simplyput this tool it's a little coil you putit over a particular part of the brainbut on the outside of the skull indeedon the outside of the hair and you caneither inhibit or stimulate particularbrain areas using this transcranialstimulation I've actually had this donenot in this particular experiment but Ihad it done when I was a graduatestudent some years ago and it was placedover my motor cortex and I wasinstructed to tap my fingers in aparticular sequence and then theyinhibit neur activity in a particularbrain area and I was unable to tap inthat same sequence and they could evenshut down my ability to tap it wasterrifying frankly although I don't wantto discourage anyone from participatingin any of these experiments should youchoose and yes of course your motorabilities come back immediatelyafterwards that's why they can run theseexperiments now in this experiment whatthey did is they stimulated or inhibitedneural activity in particular areas ofthe prefrontal cortex and what theydiscovered was I think and many othersby the way also agree a remarkableresultwhich is that when they stimulated overa particular region of the prefrontalcortex people's honest report of whathappened when they rolled the dierelative to the number they werepresented increased okay so they wentfrom reporting that they had matched thenumber on the screen and therefore wonmoney 68% of the time that number wasreduced down to what down to 50% of thetime in other words this stimulation ofthe prefrontal cortextook dishonest people even though theywere should we say mildly dishonest ordishonest only in certain conditionsthere were getting into judgment callsand I don't want to do that and madethem truly honest they Faithfullyrepresented reality when a particulararea of the prefrontal cortex and thatarea by the way is the dorsal lateralprefrontal cortex was activated theybecame truly honest they Faithfullyrepresented what happened in the diaryrolling game now the conditions in thisexperiment are Far and Away differentfrom the journaling protocol that we'vetalked about up until now however therehave been subsequent studies that haveshown that indeed when people tell thetruth to the best of their abilitiesthey are absolutely trying to Faithfullyreport what happened in a givenexperience of theirs activity in theprefrontal cortex goes up and itpersists afterwards there is indeedneuroplasticity of the prefrontal cortexso the hypothesis that seems to be themost likely and indeed has the greatestweight of evidence for it is that whenpeople accurately and truthfully reportan experience even if that experience isa stressful and traumatic one therepeated activation of the prefrontalcortex that occurs during thattruthtellah a sort of runaway positiveeffect in the sense that it creates amore coherent framework andunderstanding of the stressful thingthat happened right so all thatdiscombobulation and that lack ofcoherent story that then leads to lackof coherence in terms of one's autonomicfunction so underlying stress andconfusion about who's responsible thatdoes seem to be resolved or at leastpartially resolved and the prefrontalcortex of course doesn't Harbor one areajust for faithful accurate reporting oftraumas and stressful events that verysame area that dorsal lateral prefrontalcortex is responsible for faithfulreporting of all sorts of other thingsand there are now more and more studies"

it costs abit of time but not even that much timeit has an emotional cost we shouldacknowledge that it's intense right andthe more intense it seems the moreeffective and third it's something thatreally can be done either in the courseof four days or across an entire monthso it has some degree of flexibility toit I would even say a great degree offlexibility to it and last but certainlynot least it's been shown over and overagain I mean more than 200 peer-reviewedstudies not just from pener but fromothers as well to have Myriad positiveeffects on the body and the mind in waysthat are not just short-term but thatare pervasive not just over months butindeed over years so I don't know aboutyou but when I first learned about thisliterature I was well initially a littlebit skeptical because that's just mynature I'm like wait how couldjournaling have such a huge impact Imean I've been journaling for years Iknow other people that journal on aregular basis and I've never heard ofthis particular impact and I certainlyhaven't heard heard or seen the data butwhen I started looking at the data Ithought oh my goodness like how come Ihaven't heard about this and I I don'treally have an answer for that althoughI will say that penne Baker and others Ithink were very early in their mergingof Mind and Body States although theinitial studies weren't really focusedon mind and body all the emphasis onimmune system and brain and Neurosciencethat actually came later so I think oneof the reasons we haven't heard aboutthis particular form of journaling isthat frankly it's nested within theacademic literature I haven't heard muchabout it being incorporated intoclinical practices although I am sure itis incorporated into clinical practicesand frankly whatever the reason I'm justgrateful to my colleague Dr DavidSpiegel who again is our associate chairof Psychiatry at Stanford he's a medicaldoctor of incredibly highly esteemedworldwide for his work onneuroplasticity and helping people withStress and Anxiety and all sorts ofother challenges for informing me aboutit so much so that I decided that nextmonth I'm going to do one bout ofwriting for each week within that monthI've opted to not do the fourconsecutive days of writing to me justpersonally that seems a bit too intenseit's not the time commitment it's theemotional commitment of placing myselfinto close proximity of some reallychallenging stressful maybe eventraumatic memories day after day afterday for 4 days personally I don't wantto do that other people might opt to dothat in um you know tighter successionand do the the four days in a row whatthe literature tells us again is that itdoesn't really matter um as long as youdo the four bouts of writing sometimewithin a month period doesn't matter ifthey all are back-to-back days or youspread them out by a week or so just torecap the other components of theprotocol you're going to write about thesame event for all four writing episodesthose writing episodes can be anywherefrom 15 to 30 minutes but not lessthroughout each writing episode you'regoing to continuously write right unlessyou need to stop to catch your breath orwipe your eyes dry of Tears you're goingto keep writing it is not necessary topay attention to grammar or spelling butsome degree of coherence maybe notperfect complete sentences but somedegree of coherence is probably usefulespecially if you decide to go back andanalyze what you wrote later which againis an option you don't have to do thatbut if you do want to do that you'regoing to go back and circle the negativewords that is the words that youperceive to be negative and you're goingto square the words that are positiveand if you like you can also reread themand see whether or not as was observedin the studies that we described therewas an increase in the amount ofcoherence about the topic or the eventthat you wrote about keep in mind thatfor each of the four boutots of writingyou want to include both facts about theevents facts about how you felt and orfeel about those events now and thirdany associationswhatsoever that happen to come to mindabout those events emotional statespeople in your life anything pastpresent or future that third category ofthings to include is really open to youfor anything you want to include theonly requirement for it to be includedis that it's true for you keep in mindalso that this writing protocol is foryou it is not necessarily to be sharednow there isn't a rule that says thatyou cannot share it with anybodyalthough I do want to introduce theimportant caveat that if you are goingto share it with someone that personshould be a dedicated Health Careideally mental health care professionalbecause there are data that suggest thatwhen we write about traumatic andstressful events while it can be verybeneficial for us it can actually betraumatic or challenging for people thatwe read it to now there's huge variationaround that statement certainly many ofyou probably know friends or familymembers or other trusted ones that youcan talk to that would be able to hearabout your stressful or traumaticexperience and not be traumatized by ithowever it does seem that the listenercan experience trauma and negativesymptoms such as challenges sleepingdistress Etc by hearing about verystressful events that have occurred toothers okay this is thirdhand trauma orobservational trauma sometimes called soif we were to adhere to the protocol asit was used in the various studies thatform the basis for what we're talkingabout today we would say that you arewriting about something that is for youreyes only in fact you are welcome totear up or delete the documentafterwards and certainly you would wantto store it in a safe place so that it'snot going to fall into hands of somebodythat you wouldn't want seeing thecontents of that writing the other thingto keep in mind is that while it's beendemonstrated over and over again thatover time these bouts of writing lead toimprovements in mental and physicalhealth as we talked about earlier it isvery normal and in fact quite likelythat one will feel pretty activated inthe negative sense that one will feelsomewhat low depressed angry sadimmediately after finishing one of thesebouts of writing especially if you fallinto the high expressor category so it'simportant that as we mentioned earlierthat you have a buffer of time afterwhich you complete the writing beforemoving into your other day's events Ialso just personally wouldn't recommendthat you do this writing exercise justprior to trying to go to sleep at nightif the experience is especiallystressful or traumatic and by definitionthe writing exercise focuses onstressful and traumatic events so keepthat in mind as well and then as a finalpoint but certainly a significant one isto keep in mind that if this writingprotocol is creating in you significantenough amounts of stress eitherpsychological or physical that yousimply don't want to do it or that it'simpeding other areas of life by allmeans just stop okay there was verylittle if any data within the papersthat I read that indicated that peoplehad to be removed from the study forthis reason but keep keep in mind thatwe're talking about purposefully delvinginto stressful or traumatic experiencesand writing about them in some detail soit stands to reason that some peoplemight not be able to tolerate that and Iwant to strongly request that beforeanyone embark on this writing protocolthat you ask yourself whether or not youare indeed prepared to deal with theemotional state that might accompanyfaithful accurate recollection of whathappened what you felt and any links orexperiences a full four four timesacross the protocol I also see no reasonwhy you couldn't do this protocol forsomething that wasn't the most stressfulor traumatic event in your life butrather take your first pass at thisprotocol with something that was verystressful maybe even traumatic butperhaps not the most traumatic event asa way of sampling whether or not it'sfor you in fact I plan to do that inreviewing the literature and preparingfor today's episode I wrote down twothings possibly three that I would wantto write about and then I ra ated themone through three one being the moststressful perhaps even traumatic theother being less stressful and the thirdthe least stressful of the three anddecided to go with writing about thesecond in that list that is themoderately stressful AK traumatic eventum as a way to First weade into thisprotocol but I will adhere to theprotocol I'm going to write about thatsame thing four times as opposed toswitching from one event to the nextMidway through the protocol so I amgoing to adhere to the protocol I'llcertainly be happy to get back to youand let you know how it goes I inviteyou if you like to embrace this protocolto try it we've provided links to theliterature that supports this protocolagain it's very rare perhaps the firsttime that I've ever done an entirepodcast episode about a single protocolor to formulate an entire podcast arounda protocol but frankly I don't look atthis protocol from pennebaker andcolleagues as just a protocol I look atit as an entire body of literature thatincludes a center of massive data thatall seem to point in the same directionwhich is that writing about somethingvery stressful or traumatic for 15 to 30minutes four times either on consecutivedays or separated out by a week betweeneach of those four writing sessions canproduce long lasting positive effects onmental and physical health and to methat's a protocol that is simply toovaluable to overlook and simply toovaluable to not share with you if you'relearning from and or enjoying

I explain how to implement this specific protocol, which takes only four days and 15-30 minutes per day. I also explain the mechanism for how the four-day writing protocol affects neuroplasticity (brain rewiring) and brain function in the short and long term. I explain how these brain changes positively impact our physical health, including our system's immune function and thus our ability to combat infections, improve sleep, reduce feelings of physical and emotional pain, lower anxiety, and bring about healing from traumas.
