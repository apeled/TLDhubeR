certainperiod of my life Drew which are peoplethat know me through my very brief andnon- illustrious career in boxingand Andy which are people that met me asI was coming up through science uh let'sjust put it this way there was anotherAndrew we did a coin flip and I lost soAndy is fine Andrew is fine whatevermakes you comfortable what's importanttoday is not how anyone refers to me butrather the discussion about your workwhich is spectacular I've known you along time and I've been following yourcareer and it's just been amazing andwonderful to see the contributionsyou've made to science and also to theculture of science so we're going totalk about both of those things to kickthings off let's talk about a brainstructure that most people I think haveheard of but that is badly misunderstoodand that's the amydala most people hearamydala and they think oh fear that'swhat the amydala is all about but youknowand I'm hoping you'll educate us on thefact that that the amydala is actuallyfar more complex than that and far moreinteresting than that so when you hearthe word amydala where does your mind goI agree that a lot of the the bandwidthon the amydala has been occupied by fearstudies but we've known actually forreally long time that the amydala isimportant for all sorts of emotionalprocessing since clu and beutyperformed lesions on on monkeys andfound that monkeys would then have flataffective responses to all sorts ofdifferent stimuli poop food inanimateobject whatever it was just nothing noemotion no emotional response nomotivational significance however youwant to phrase it to things that usuallywould make you either you know disgustedor excited or neutral and so um I thinkthat that knowledge about the amydalawas there from the beginning it's notsomething I came up with um but thenit's interesting it's almost a it's ameta statement or meta observation abouthow scientific research progressessometimes you make a lot of progress inone particular vein because it's easy topress forward there but it's importantto also think about all the other partsand filling in the space in between tomake sure you haven't missed anything sothe narrative about the amigdala becameabout fear and and I think also justwhen we think aboutsurvival when you are an animal in thenatural world especially if you're aprey animal which is the majority youknow that's a lot of animals um then youneed to prioritize escaping a predatorit's immediate threat on your survivalversus rewards set mating drinking watergetting food these things can be donelater escaping this Predator isParamount and so there should be somenatural a symmetry in how we processemotion at Baseline and so that'ssomething that we've looked into a lotas well but um I think the the bigpicture discovery that um my team hascontributed to our understanding of theamigdala is that it represents a fork inthe road uh for processing emotionalveence and thinking about all these oldpsychological theories about how do youemotionally evaluate the world aroundyou what's what's the what's the chainof events is there chain of eventswhat's happening in a certain order umversus what's happening in parallel forexample one model is you know there'sall this information that comes in andthen we have to filter out what'simportant um what's going to besomething I need to pay attention toversus what do I need to ignore if I'mdriving I need to pay attention to theroad this this light this pedestrianjust started walking versus you knowwhat it feels like for my sock to betouching my foot not super relevantright now or the my butt against theseat not nothing I need to pay attentionto I need to focus on you know thedynamic information then you have toselect you know the Second Step would beselecting whether it's good or bad andwhat you want to do with it and so thatprocess I think the selection of whetheryou're um assigning it a positive ornegative veilance happens in the amydalaso glad you brought up this wordveilance I think it's a word that somescientists but most of the generalpublic are probably not familiar with solet's um talk about veilance um and thenI want to go back to the amydala and umkind of explore some of its diversity offunction a little bit more so when Ihear the word veilance I think goodnessversus Badness yeah of something is thatbasically basically it's been used in alot of different fields I think of thatyou know negative and positive numbersor or um but it's an analogy that wetake to just mean yeah net positive netnet negative and it's it's a intentionaldeparture from the word value um valuebecomes very scalar everything's on youknow it can be in the same directionwith different magnitudes is often howwe think about value it it could berepresenting both valances but um oftenit's a small reward and a big reward orsmall punishment and big punishment ishow experimentally we parse um value andso veillance is just asking about um howyour brain responds to things that aregood or bad what are neurons that mightrespond similarly to things that aregood and bad you know those might beimportance neurons rather than umpositive or negative veilance neurons soyeah I I think it's a it's just a termthat that signifies that next step sowhen we walk into say a novel"

            "text": "environment um do you think that ouramygdalas are active and really tryingto figure out whether or not anenvironment a set of people or a personis safe and really just check that boxfirst in order to be able to do otherthings is you know is this business ofum determining veilance and the role ofthe amydala in that kind of the firstgate that we have to walk throughanytime we're in a new environment forinstance you showed up here today andyou mentioned you know I think I lockedmy car and um and I said you'll be finein this neighborhood either way and thenyou walked in and presumably you weretaking in the new environment meetingsome new people um we had a littlediscussion about caffeine uh a littlediscussion about alcohol and presumablybecause you and I know one another youfelt safe I would hope so but presumablythe amydala is always performing thisrole even if we have some priorknowledge about something just figuringout am I safe here where are the exitswhere are the entrances uh who's herewhat's their story um do you think allof that is is operating and do you thinkit's always conscious or is it largelyunconscious to usokay so there's a few differentquestions there um first I want toaddress the the question about noveltyand then I want to come back to this theother issue of conscious but um the waythat amydala works is its job is is toassign meaning to anything that couldhave motivational significance and so ifit's a brand new thing we're payingattention we're seeing if if it if itmattered did it matter and so I thinkanything that's novel even if we don'tknow what it means a loud sound you'venever heard before um even if itsignifies nothing of motivationalsignificance the first few times thatyou're presented with it you'll get anamigdalar response so you see this inthe lab play the tone for the first timeand then there's a response that rapidlydecays when the tone doesn't end uppredicting anything that the the animalcan can detect or human is this alsotrue in this is true in humans um ifyou're the type of person that puts yourphone on do not disturb versus has it onvibrate and you know sometimes it'salways vibrating and it's just itvibrates all the time whereas I put myphone on do not disturb and so whensomeone else's phone rings it's verystartling to me but they they don't evennotice because their phone that's justthe sound their phone makes it makes itall the time so I think it has to dowith how many times you're presentedwith it and it's it's a startle responseso the first few times that you arepresented with a stimulus uh the amydalawill respond and then it decays veryquickly and then only if that stimuluspredicts something important orsomething rewarding or or punishing thenuh will will begin to respond again soit's it's like you're giving everythingnovela chance to to tell you in one trial insingle trial learning um if something'sgoing to happen andso um I think a fire alarm is a greatexample you know fire alarm goes offyou'reyou're instantly you know you're lookingaround is there anything happening eveneven just people rushing out you knowthere's there's this the Salient thingthat you're going to respond to and youknow if you have a lot of fire drillsthen you might respond differently aftera while so I think that's thehabituation component you mentioned thatthe amigdala will respond to a novelstimulusum and if it predicts somethinginteresting then other things happenwe'll talk about those um if not theamydala stops responding and you saidsomething really important which is thatthe amydala will respond to somethingthat is predicting reward or punishmentand I think most people don't realizethat in fact I think a lot of earlycareer neurobiologists don't realizethat that the amydala is not justinvolved in fear and Punishment um sowhen we talk about the amydalapresumably we're talking about theamydala complex a bunch of other thingsso is it true that there are neurons inthe amydala complex that predict rewardand others that predict fear andPunishment yeah so um as a graduatestudent I worked on a part of theamydala called the basolateral amydalait's still a complex Within the broaderamydalaum this brain region is cortical like inthat it's mostly glutamatergic neuronswith some gab argic neurons mixed in butwithout the same structure that thecortex has um and I studied the theamigdala in the context of reward Ifound essentially that when you induceplasticity you get a synapticstrengthening when you uh when animalslearn things amigdala neurons fire inresponse to cues that predict rewardsand this was you coming into the contextof a field that had shown that thishappens with fear and so this became I Iremember my the very first time I gaveum a SC a presentation at a scientificconference I was a junior graduatestudent I was given a 10-minute talk atthe you know inaugural amigdala Gordonresearch conference many famousprofessors werespeaking and there were two talks aboutthe amigdala and reward and I was one ofthem and the response to the talk wasjust how is this possible how can howcan the amydala how can how can you getthe same readout for reward and fear andreally it came to be there's two twopossibilities I there's morepossibilities but the main twopossibilities are number one that theamydala wasn't specific for fear at allit just responds to anything importantif it's important it responds period theother possibility is that the amydala issending has different neurons thatrespond to positive and negativepredictive stimuli and sends thisinformation to different Downstreamtargets to respond differently obviouslyI respond differently to a reward I walktowards it I I consume it a punishmentI'm avoiding it and so clearly thebehaviors are diametrically opposed andso to me it seemed very possible atleast that that there was a Divergencepoint and maybe this could be it and sowe just did some very simple experimentswhen I first started my lab to trace theprojection targets of amydala neuronsand record and so everything's all mixedup together so it's not obvious thatthey would that that this would be afork in the road but when you look atthem you do see that there areprojections that come from the amigdalathat are predominantly encoding eitherreward or fear and there's manydifferent projections and um you knowthis is just the beginning but this wasa time when ita novel concept to even think thatneurons from one region could havecompletely different functions going todifferent Downstream targets which nowseems totally obvious um and it there'shundreds and hundreds of papers showingit now but at the time it was difficultto get this work published becausethat's just not how people thoughtabout information moving through thebrain I guess well I think um first ofall such important work and so wonderfulto be uh uh early in the the phase ofrecasting how the brain works which iswhat you did um I think most people inthe general public still think amydala"

greatquestion great question so um I'll tellyou the clues that lead me to my currentworking model which may you know is notnecessarily the final word but I wouldsay that I think the amydala complex aswe're discussing it these 13 subnucleithat reside you know in the temporallobethey are important for assigningimportance but they're not important forproducing the actual autonomic arousalthat we associate with Panic or fear thereason I say this is there's a famouscase study patient SM who have hasbilateral damage to her amyd and um inyou know no responses to emotional facesno responses to fearful stimuli um butif youif capable of having the Panic responsedue to low to to Suffocation associatedwith it with Suffocation and so there'sstill the ability to produce that panicand arousal response um it's just notthe cognitive evaluation of it I thinkthat's what we think the amydala isdoing is assigning that it it doesreceive information from the rest of thebody um there are for example ginreceptors in the amydala things that cansense hunger and um we've donesome some work looking at this kind ofinspired by I'm not sure if this you'refamiliar with this study um it's acontroversial study Dan zigger 2011 butwhere the Supreme Court judges they theylooked at Supreme Court Judge rulings onon parole decisions um across the dayrelative to meal breaks and you can seeright after it's like it's likebreakfast you know 90% everybody'sgetting for everybody's getting out yeahand then it just drops till 10% thenthere's lunch then we're back to 80% andthen it just precipitously drops tosingle digits again so the judges arechanging the leniency of their rulingsdepending on how wellfed they are youknow there there are counterarguments tothis but that is strongly what the datasuggests you know it is not a controlledstudy it is just a striking correlationum but it's the it's it's not acompletely novel concept the hangryphenomenon I'm sure I don't knoweverybody's different I certainlyexperience it um but we we think thatwhen you are getting strong signals fromthe body for example you know I think Ithink the amdal is going to be able todetect a lot of different homeostaticinputs even though we haven't we don'thave evidence for that yet but forspecifically energy balance when you'rehungry um your amydala can detect itperhaps through grin receptors or otherother you know mechanisms um and thenwhat we see is that in that food depriveafter one day of food dep deprivationfor miceum you can see this shift in the balancebetween the positive veilance umencoding projection neurons and thenegative veence en coding projectionneurons and a atBaseline fear trumps all the negativeprojection neurons you know can silencethe reward projection ones which makessense if I need to run away from thisPredator you know I can't I can't worryabout eating this food right now but ifI'm in a near starvation like statewhich for my they have very highmetabolism so one day without food is areally big deal um they only last a fewdays so um at this point they arekicking into survival mode whereactually getting food becomes the thegreater need and you'll see animals youknow hunting in ways they normallywouldn't hunt when when they're reallydesperate and so this mode of of fooddeprivation shifts things so that thereward um pathway actually has strongerpower to to influence and silence the uhfear pathway than before wow the brainis so smart it really is it can takewhat we normally think of as a prioritylist fear and staying safe is moreimportant than food reward and then iffood and acquiring food is critical tosurvival it can invert all that is whatyou're saying exactly amazing and ithappens you know in a day it seemsreversible so that's something thatwe're looking at right now and thinkingabout um um how specific is this this tofood is this true for lots of differentthings what about exercise other otherstressors that are you know potentiallymore positive the amydala is able todetect a lot of different signals fromthe environment and we're not sure howall of that gets in there um so I thinkone of the the detection of theenvironment has been you know reallywell worked out in terms of our basicsensory modalities but think about thethings that really affect your emotionsday-to- day at least for me as a humanin this Society the things that affectmy emotions mostly today are almostentirely social interactions very subtleones ones that don't seem to threaten mylife or safety you know very smallsubtle um social interactions are arewhat you know have the greatest bearingI think on um my emotional evaluationand my emotional bandwidth and what isthat how do we detect that how do weassemble this information apply all theNuance you know put on the onion layersof social programming to come out withwhatever you know I interpret thisgesture to mean it's it's prettyincredible and so that's kind of whereuh my

stuff sometimes they saypositive things sometimes they see saynegative things sometimes they saythings that are sort of neutral um so itseems to me that nowadays if one is onthese social media platforms that we areum we've sort of crowdsourcedthis phenomenon of social interaction ina way that we hadn't before because I Igrew up prior to the Advent of socialmedia and I could bring my physical bodyinto certain environments and not otherseven at high school I could hang out wehad an area called the Batcave where youknow skateboarders and some other atthat time Misfits hung out with the quadwhere the cool kids hung out um Etc youcould you could pick your Niche okaysocial media is not like that you canpick followers they can pick you Etc butI think since most people have socialmedia nowadays seems or on there in someways that we've placed ourselves in thecenter of an arena which we have a tonof incoming input we all most of us haveamigdalas two of them amydala youpointed out one on each side of thebrain and presumably we're on theseplatforms to receive positive feedbackand avoid negative feedbackhowever there does seem to be a cohortof people who seem to like the frictionof com combat or kind of let's just callit high friction interactions ormoderate friction interactions they liketo argue they like to parse ideas it'snot all bad necessarily um so have youever looked at social media in your inyour own mind looked at social mediathrough the lens of of amydala filteringor through the lens of of neural circuitfiltering and kind of wondered um what'sgoing on there that someone with withoutyour in-depth knowledge of these braincircuitries would not think to uh lookat that landscape through or maybe wecould just do that now as a as as a kindof play experiment I like that um so I alot of people ask me about social mediafrom the context of is this of is thissocial contact meaningful is thispositive does this count does this helpyou not feel lonely um and of course Idon't know the answer we haven't donethat particular study yet and I don't Idon't know of that specific study havingbeen performed but my prediction um isthat it's not going to do much because II believe that a key component of what Iwould consider social contact heavilydepends on having some interbrainsynchron some interaction in in that issynchronous and I think with socialmedia sometimes there can be an engagingdialogue that plays out in near realtime but generally speaking it'sasynchronous you're looking at thingsthat are happened that you're not a partof you're excluded from all these thingsthey happened in Australia yesterday andI'm on there saying cool love it andthen the person's already asleep yesexactly that's by asynchronousasynchronous like that we're notexperiencing things at the same timeit's not a shared experience you knowthat in in terms of that having thatBond necessarily and so I've neveractually been asked about how theamydala processes social media um Iguess I think what happens is you knowthe amydala is just responding tostimuli sending up bottom up signals youknow it's a caricature of of um bottomup and top down processing let's give anexample that I'm I'm walking down thestreet and all of a sudden I hear like areally ferocious dog barking at me allgoing crazy and then I get super scaredand then I realize okay there's a fenceso the amydala detect you know heard thedog barking hey there's a dog barkingand you know I'm freaking out then myprefrontal cortex realizes there the Fit looks very sturdy this fence looksstable and then I'm relaxing and I'mresuming my walking normally you know Ithink that's sort of the dance that ourbrain is doing when we have top down andbottom up uh information then we'retrying to stay focused so for me I thinkwhen I'm on social media there's so manystimuli that that are evoking responsesand um to be completely transparent andI know this is not something thateverybody else does or can do isnecessarily what's best for them but Iwork very hard to control input from thetop down um in terms of I really reallylimit the amount I I basically don'tcheck email or go on social media Iwould say I'm on social media or emailless than one hour per week basicallyperek per week oh I have to say to thatis congratulations we'll talk aboutsocial media again in a second but as afellow Professor email once a week I'veheard of people scheduling their timesfor email responses but once a week thatis awesome I have have people who helpme get through it and filter out what'simportant but otherwise I just wheneverI do my own email I say yes to all thesethings then I make all these plans andthen I'm and then I'm have too manytrips and I'm responding fra fragmentedfragmented and it's just you knowovercommit and I think um I know mylimits sometimes it's difficult ult forme to be in my amydala mode respondingto stimuli and yet letting my prefrontalcortex do its thing so I've set somevery heavy prefrontal corticallyselected limits of the input I put in sothat my brain can function and be clearI can't be creative I can't haveepiphanies if there's all this clutterof like writing this person back andblah blah blah blah blah tweet tweetit's just you know trash out wipesqueegee squeegee the brain down so thatwe can actually grow something beautifuland newwell and I want to re-emphasize what Isaid in my introduction which is that Imean you are oh so productive and when Isay productive I don't just meanproductive like plug-and chug you youthe work you've done is incrediblycreative you transformed ourunderstanding of what this famousstructure the amydala actually does Imean you've made so many importantdiscoveries as a consequence ofpresumably other things but includingwiping away all this incoming clutter asyou said controlling the top- downinputs I have to ask just from apractical standpoint during that onehour a week are you reading every emailthat came in or are you just being veryselective about which emails so you'renot opening most emails no I don't openmost emails amazing no I just I searchfor the ones that my assistantidentifies as the one I need to openthere's like a list of things that i'would be interested in and then we'll gothrough the list and then you knowsometimes it requires me to go and findthe email and respond to my myselfbecause it that is and then I would dothat for 10 you know 10 10 minutes a dayor something do you recommend get out ofthere as soon as I can love it um do youpass on this advice to the people thatyou train I think it depends on whatresources and what's your what's thewhat's your job right now right so Ithink um as a traine I definitely did myas a assistant professor I did my ownemails but at a certain point um I wasjust never getting to the bottom andthen it would just stress me out make mefeel overwhelmed and what is my job myjob is to numberone be astable core of a sustainable researchprogram and um that just requires mehaving a lot of mental health andwell-being and um and andclear-mindedness and I need to be ableto come up with creative ideas

            "text": "future guest on this podcast named CalNewport he wrote the book deep work andhe has another book called A WorldWithout email he's a computer scienceprofessor at Georgetown where he talksextensively about the tremendous careerbut also relationship and life value ofdoing essentially what you're describingalthough I do think Kay that yourepresent kind of the extreme of whatI've um become aware of in terms ofpeople that can limit the amount of timeon uh social media platforms and emailanyway I just want to say umcongratulations I just want to say thatagain and I think it even if peopledon't reduce to one hour per week Ithink that making some effort towardreducing the amount of incoming as yousaid controlling the top- down inputs tothe amydala but also to the rest of thebrain involved in Creative processingEtc is so key and we actually do haveagency it's just it's it's tough umsometimes to build up that discipline soyou're doing a tremendous service bysharing that somebody as successful asyou does this presumably is successfulin part because you do this could we byextension say that many people sincebillions of people are on social mediaare likely um triggering the activationof their amygdala clouding out othermore potentially productive activationof their neural circuits by S justmaking themselves freely available tothe to the uh thoughts and words andimpulses of others I mean to me it seemsthe answer would be yes but I'd like toknow what you think I mean I think umand there's something to be said there'sdefinitely been moments where I've I'veyou know gone a deep into social mediaand spent more time in a certain burstright that is isolated and I think thatthere's a lot to be learned from socialmedia so to actually to bring it back toone point you mentioned earlier um onsocial media sometimes people Pro justwant accolades and sometimes there's alot of of friction one of the reasons Istay on social media even though I'mmaking this big effort to sort ofdeclutter my Consciousness is because ofthat feedback especially when you knowfor someone like you I imagine this hasgot to be super true and even for me ata certain point in my career it justfelt like people don't want to tell mebad news to my face as much anymoreeverybody's so positive all the time andyou know what they what are they reallythinking and social media allows you theprotection of anonymity to say what youreally think without um consequenceessentially and so on the oneand theconsequence-freeum nature of being able to just saythings can be very dangerous but at thesame time for me I really value justbeing able to receive it I I'm you knowI'm a big girl I can filter out what Iwant when I get the all the inputs butif I don't receive the inputs sometimesit's hard to learn from the feedback I'mnot getting so even sometimes feedbackis given in a not very nice way I canstill create a model for someone elsethat has this perspective that I cantake with me and that can be anotherperspective I can honor easily in thefuture because I have this theory ofmind for someone some someone would getupset about that uh you know that'ssomething that could be harmful topeople who are think you know have thistheory of mind so I think it's supervaluable from that perspective andthat's why I continue to useit great yeah I I really applaud that aswell I I always read my teaching evalsbecause they're Anonymous and yes I dowonder you know what grade the differentuh people who gave different evals youknow got I don't know that information Isometimes wonder do they attend theclass or they just angry they didn't dowell on the exam but that reallyrepresents the small fraction offeedback that I'm um that I wonder aboutmost of it um that's valuable to me isthe hey you know liked the course butthese parts really sucked Professorhuberman or this part was completelyunclear or completely hated the way youblank blank and blanked because thatfeedback is something I can really workwith to improve so I think um course EVvals are are similar to what you'redescribing I think there's value thereif I were to just look at the thepositive feedback and then ignore thenegative feedback and write those peopleoff then I don't think I could improveas a teacher actually I always encouragecomments and feedback and suggestions inthe YouTube comments for this podcastfor that reason and I do read thecomments I go through and I read and uma few of them sting um but you know thepositive feedback is great too sometimesit's more of this please y or less ofthat please I think there there'sinformation in that um so I think itsounds like you've been doing all ofthese things naturally I so so actuallythen uh since I've had my research groupmy my lab um we do an anonymous labsurvey every it's supposed to be aboutevery 18 months and then it's a wholelong process of going through it andit's just evolved it's I think it's thefourth or fifth time we've done it andso it's now I think it's like 70questions it's so many question we gotmaybe we should we should trim it downbut it it ends up being hundreds ofpages of of text you know short answersometimes long answer feedback fromanonymously from people in my lab my labis pretty big so it's it's you know I'mnot even trying to really guess who issaying it it's just feedback and ittakes me months to go through with itand and get all the feedback and it isso useful I mean in a class the the theamount of contact that you have is it'sit's restricted to this very specifictime and space whereas when you'rementoring someone over the course ofyears there's a lot of differentthere's a lot of different points of ofcontent and interaction and you knowyou're in the lab all 40 hours a week orwhatever and you know going trip meetinghere there's just a lot of differentdifferent ways to improve and ways we'venever you know I haven't had anytraining in how to be a really greatmentor and so I'm getting that trainingnow I'm making my own course and mymentees are my teachers and um I reallyam grateful for the the tutelage thatthey provide for free in this anonymmust lab survey sometimes it makes mecry but sometimes it makes me feelreally good about something that I'mdoing that's working and in any case itmakes me feel that I have ground truth Iguess I still don't know but when peoplesay things that sting um it makes mefeel like they're saying what theyreally think and they're not holdingback it doesn't you know and um bad newsfeels like reality and so that is verysomething about that is rewardingum just to feel like I have realityrather than I'm getting something elseyou know that the model doesn't quitefit it's very unsatisfying with themodel doesn't quite fit so I love theword ground truth there's something sobeautiful to that and I I resonate withum what you'resaying let's go back to socialinteraction something that your lab is"

            "text": "doing um lots of work on nowadays andmaybe we could shift to the sorts ofsocial interaction that most of us arefamiliar with with the um sitting acrossthe table having a coffee with somebodythe taking a walk with somebody maybe aphone call yeah um maybe a toughconversation um maybe a playful you knowum you know unscripted conversation ummaybe a meal at a holiday dinner youknow there's a huge range there whatwhat do we know about the value ofsocialinteraction at the level of sort of corebiological needs like at the level ofneural circuits and maybe even hormonesI mean you know most people have heardof oxytocin they think the love hormonebut it's there's so much more there forpeople to understand and know about youknow how important is this thing that wecall social interaction and how bad dothings get when we're not getting theright kinds of social interaction youknow I think this is this is a greatquestion and I'm glad that it's becomesomething that has been recognized at amore global a national scale just theimportance of of having social supportin our lives for heal for our well-beingum but social isolation or even justperceived loneliness has immense Healthconsequences for all social species soum shortenedlifespanincreased mooddisorders um increased actuallymorbidity and mortality for disease likecancer or heart disease that you know ummight not be what we would normallythink and so I think understanding howeach of those processes is happeningthose mechanisms are far from beingworked out but the the correlationalevidence is undeniable we're now takingthis into the lab really for the firsttime and so something so simple associal isolation how can we don't knowway more about it and um I'm someone whostumbled into the field field of socialisolation by accident prior to thepandemic and so I'll just say you knowthe whole story on why there's such agaping hole in our knowledge as aneuroscience Community about socialisolation really comes from Harry haro'swork this original work of maternalseparation that was undeniably cruel itit caused irreparable damage to thesebaby monkeys and they never recoveredand sorry to interrupt apologize I'mstriving to not interrupt in my life butI but so that people are on on board umcould you just briefly describe theharlo experiments yes so they're veryfamous experiments where they separateduh baby monkeys from their moms and thenhad either a wire sort of thing holdinga bottle so okay what what do you missmost about the mom is it the wire is itthe food or is it the the the comfortand then they hadso they had a wire thing with with amilk bottle versus you know blankets andcuddly soft things and and the the babymonkeys would go to the cuddly softthing but you know a blanket is not areplacement for a mother nobody's sayingthat it is and and through theseexperiments there was extended maternalseparation and it's it it was deemedcruel um there was permanent irreparabledamage when you when you rehouse thesemonkeys they never resocialized normallythey had lots of different mental andphysical health problems um and I thinkin humans we know that so you knowsolitary confinement is consideredtorture um you know social isolation isa difficult thing to study in in a lotofconditions and we stumbled onto it bycomplete accident through working with apostto a former postdoc in my labJullian Matthews who was a graduatestudent um doing an experiment on on itwas just trying to figure out if thesedopamine neurons um would also respondto cocaine the way VTA these sorry thesevental tegmental area dopamine earonswere known to respond to cocaine wantedto see if these other dopamin respond tococaine so sort of a incremental studyso when you do these cocaine studies youyou inject the animal with cocaine orsaline and they leave the naive animalin the cage and then you take brainslices record from the neurons and lookat the synaptic strengths and so youknow the expected outcome sort of wasthat these dopamine NS would would besimilar to other dopamine nands thatshowed in you know long- lastingpotentiation after a single dose ofcocaine but what happened instead wasthat yes there was potentiation in thecocaine animals there's alsopotentiation in the saline animalsrelative to the naive group and this wasa huge puzzle what was this and itturned out through many many differentexperiments um that it's actuallybecause when you inject animals withcocaine you're separating them from thegroup they I act all crazy and this iswhat the way people did the experimentso you inject them with saline youseparate them the naive animals juststay there so with their other theirother litter mates I see so the controlgroup The saling control group isactually a social isolation condition soby accident this control group thatdidn't make sense was how we stumbledonto so then we tried is it novel cageit's not the novel cage it's the it'sthe social isolation and so um that ishow we became a lab that studied socialisolation it was complete accident weweren't sure what what we were lookingat and then um we man we found theseneurons and we manipulate these neuronsand theyproduced um something very differentthan other dopamine neurons whichnormally if you stimulate dopamineneurons these ventral tental areamid-brain dopam like 90% of the timewhen you you hear people talk aboutdopamine they mean these ones andthey're the ones where you press a leverstimulate the nerves we'll press a leverthousands of times you know and theylove to be stimulated yes and if ifyou're a human and you do cocaine youyou most people love cocaine they theywant they're very pro-social whenthey're on cocaine and so that's whatdopamine neurons were thought to bedoing but these other dopamine neuronsin the dorsal rap that I will also sayis in the brain stem near to an aqueductwhere you could detect signals from thebody um but these other dopamine neuronsin the raap they when you stimulate themanimals don't like it they will not workfor reward they actually will move awayfrom a space that's where they're beingstimulated you know condition place andreal-time Place aversion I don't likethe feeling of these neurons beingactivated please stop it and yet theywould be pro-social and so for a longtime this was super confusing wecouldn't understand it and then justbecause at the same time we had a um ahunger study going on in the lab we justthought about it like I can eat foodbecause it's delicious and I I want toeat this yummy treat or I can eatbecause I'm super hungry I feel shakyI'm just to eat this nasty fiber bar outof my backpack CU I'm so desperate and Ineed like I need my my blood sugar isdangerously low you know and so there'stwo reasons that you can eat and one ofthem is uncomfortable hunger is notcomfortable you don't it's not a goodfeeling to be hungry and so we thoughtabout this and that's kind of how wecircularly came around to thinking Ithink we've discovered the lonelinessneurons essentially and so what isloneliness and loneliness is thisunpleasant need state of wanting socialcontact that would have thispro-social effect as well and so umthat's basically the very serendipitousloop-de-loop way that I came to be um uhstudying how loneliness is representedin the brain amazing before we talk abit more about these loneliness neurons"

um for instance areyou more aware of how much time youspend alone versus with others are youum more careful or Discerning about whoyou spend your time with um you know I Iasked this um because you know there'sso many examples for me in theNeuroscience literature where you know Ilearned something new about how thebrain works and I think oh yeah you knowit makes a lot of sense why my sleepisn't great you know it turns out thatlight exposure to the eyes at particulartimes of day really sets the whole bodyand brain into particular rhythms thatyou know explain why I was a littledepressed when I was in graduate schoolstaying up all night doing experimentsand I'd sleep much of the day and feellike I was getting eight nine hours Idon't get eight to nine hours now but umyou know and when I wake up early for mepersonally there's a bit of ananti-depressant effect as long as Islept the night before seasonal effectdisorder is real right so you know Ithink as new information comes online umat least for me it's it's changed theway that I organize my life to to s insubtle or or in not so subtle ways sothe idea that there are neurons in thebrain that encode loneliness the absenceof social contact does that have youthinking you know after a few days ofmanaging the lab uh with which as youpoint out you have a very large lab lotsof social interaction but it's workcontext social interaction does that umhas that led you to think hey you knowwe should go out to dinner as a lab or Ishould spend time with somebody who'snot in science um or I should spend timeby myself because I've had too muchsocial interaction I'm not asking forstrict protocols here I'm just wonderingif you're willing to get um like play inthe sandbox of this with me a bit um howthis information perhaps has shaped someof your choices you personally and andbe very clear I'm not asking you todictate what other people do um has itchanged your social life so it's reallyinteresting that you ask this questionand now that you you know now thatyou're asking it this wayum I I mean of course when I learn newthings I I I um take them and Implementthem into my life but to be honest in inthe cycle of of of you know learning andstudying and being curious and Iactually think where I reside more iswhen something's going on with me myresearch program you know research isresearch it becomes what the re itdictates what the research programevolves into and so for ex for exampleso I've just had started studyingloneliness um a few years before thepandemic hit and then the pandemic hitand it was just a step function likechange I went from I'm never aloneunless you call being in an Uber Aloneum or being on a plane and and and justyou know constantly people in my officeeven when I'm going to the bathroomsomeone's waiting for me outside likeyou know I'm not it's like I'm hurryingin the bathroom I'm never alone there'slike four people in my bed kicking me inthe face I'm just you know there's justso much Social contact and then boom youknow there wouldbe a day I wouldn't see another like youknow just the a not zero but justextremely sudden drop of social contactwhen there's no more work and you knowit was just that that period of timeand it was it was very depressing it wasjust this huge I felt like I was infreef fall and it made me you know atfirst it was really disruptive and I wasworried about myself you know and thenat some point I adjusted to it and thenI got used to working from home I gotstarted a garden like I got all this youknow I got you know I just started adifferent life pattern that involved alot of alone time and you know somethingan alone time personal life AG grewwhere there wasn't any space foranything to grow before and then Ibecame comfortable with it and so then Istarted thinking about that that'sreally where the idea of socialhomeostasis was born this idea that okaywhy is it with acute social isolationhumans monkeys mice you know you acutelyisolate the individual from the socialgroup you reintroduce them to the socialgroup rebound of pro-social interactionoh so happy to see you there's like allthese affiliative interactions a Hu aburst of affiliative interactionswhereas with chronic social isolation inhumans monkeys mice evenflies you reintroduced into the socialgroup and you get territorial Behavioraggression avoidance antisocial behaviorum or just you know sort of a verydifferent negative veillance response tothe exposure to the group and so thismaybe people brushed it off for a longtime is just oh it's confusing thisliterature is inconsistent or maybethere's one model that makes it all makesense that is social home homeostasiswhere you know you're used to gettingthis at a certain point and so myaffector system gets activated I Idetect that I'm alone it's I want morethe deficits detected then my affectorsystems gets activated this and then Istart spinning all the systems that tryto get me back into contact I'm callingmy friends I'm texting my friend I'm I'mif I'm a mouse I'm making ultrasonicvocalizations I'm exploring outside ofthe burrow and then you know if myfriends don't call me back they're likesorry we don't want to see anyone tillend of covid bye whatever it is you knowyou it's it's not working my correctionefforts are failing or maybe a certainamount of time we don't know then I giveup I stop I stop calling I stop goingout I just make a different life youknow you the the the they don't youdon't leave the burrow whatever it isand there's in in animal and humans atleast behaviorally there's a near stepfunction like drop off of attempts toyou know you can see sort of dat oh thenthey just give up on dating after thisone you know whatever happens there'ssome some straw that breaks the camelsback and then this person doesn't wantto date anymore or doesn't want to goout anymore whatever and and what isthat so that adaptation then you're at anew Baseline you're You're Expecting nowyour new normal I'm I'm expecting tohave a gardening day at home alone notsee anyone and then and then a bunch ofpeople come over feels like a surplus somy previous Optimum you knowreintroduction to the socialgroup is now feeling like a surplus anoverload overstimulated and that's Ithink something that a lot of peopleexperience this Whiplash of going intothe pandemic and coming out of itdifferent people to different levels itdepends on how much you you knowisolated while you were in the pandemicbut I think thinking about um yoursocial set point as being flexible anddynamic Was A New Concept to me and thenin my mind the question is what is thepart of this process that is causing allthese harmful Health consequences likeshorten lifespan mood disorders Etc isit the initial detection that I'mmissing something and affect your systemactivation because if that was the casemaybe I want to Band-Aid that you knowmaybe I want to get get a pet get a geta get a zoom buddy I don't know what youknow you would have differentprescriptions and advice to give peoplethat were the case versus you would givealmost opposite advice if the thingthat's causing it is the the set pointadaptation then you want to you want tosave it off versus if you wanted toaccelerate getting into the set pointwhich is better you know is it theadaptation or is it you know kind oftrying to fix it and so in one case youwould want to ease off the the havingthe set point happen the set pointtransition happen in the other case ripit off like a Band-Aid cold turkey JustAdjust and then you'll be fine you knowthen you won't worry about it then youwon't be lonely anymore cuz you'll justbe comfortable being alone you knowpeople talk about cognitive flexibilityum and I think it's it's sort of likethat but it's social flexibility I wantto be able to be alone I also want to beable to be in a large group and becomfortable and so I think what I'vedone if anything to change my lifestyleum to accommodate these new insightsI've had is is toconsciously create Dynamic socialexperiencelots of social experiences yes but alsoprotecting alone time which I never didbefore I just I just just gave it allaway and you know I realized that havingthat just made my social homeostaticsystem feel more elastic and flexibleand resilient and less like a crisis ifsomething you know I'm I'm verycomfortable being alone I'm supercomfortable with my own skin now and itrequires investing in that relationshipI like how you framed uh earlier I thinkwe were not not recording yet but therelationship with yourself as being avery important relationship and um whenI think about brain States you know wedon't know this yet but my working modelwould be that different individuals werepresent their identities and wheneverthey're present it creates a uniqueEnsemble of that combination of peoplebeing present and being alone is also aunique state that cannot be achieved Ihave the brain state of being alone Icannot achieve it if anyone else isaroundand that's just what you know that'skind of the working model I have I thinkwhat you're saying is uh essential for"

interactionsand resetting energy through socialinteractions as opposed to introvertedwhich by the way folks introverts likemyself do enjoy social interaction it'sjust that we reset through more um Soloor one-on-one time than we do in largergroups that's my understanding of theintroversion extroversion literature wecan revisit that but this notion ofsocial homeostasis is I think so key uhimportant enough that I think weprobably wantto redefine it um as many times orrestate it rather as many times as it'snecessary because I believe what you'redescribing is the same thing that onewould experience with food if we eat alot we're consuming I know 3500 caloriesa day and then um suddenly we only haveaccess to 1,800 calories a day there'sit feels like a deficit because indeedit is whereas after some period of timeat 1,800 calories a day 2200 calories aday feels like relative abundancerelative abundanceum when the pandemic hit I certainly umwas unhappy about the State of Affairsin the world of course um but I recallfeeling like oh my goodness I finallydon't have to commute 90 minutes in eachdirection to Stanford because I lived inthe East Bay at that time um I felt likeI had time to do things I hadn't done ina long time and thanks to zoom I wasable to get certain things done notothers then after about six to eightmonths when I realized this is going tocarry on for a while I remember feelingquite lonely and making some efforts torepair that I Ithink social media not to harp on socialmedia um could do either one of twothings and I don't know which in thecontext of uh socialhomeostasis either going on Instagramand seeing a lot of familiar faces andcomments and accounts could make me feellike I'm getting some social interactionsuch that then when I close that app andmove to my work at my desk or somethinguh which these days is mostly done umsolo um that I would feel like I hadsocial interaction or perhaps it's theequivalent of umcalories that um then makes me feel moreisolated when I'm not in the appperhaps I find it to be distinctlydifferent than like the experience I hadlast night of going to dinner withsomeone I know quite well sitting downand having a open-ended conversation anddeciding to close out the night onlywhen we realized you know we got to getup tomorrow for work so went ourseparate ways um there's something thatfelt very s ating about it so I wonderin this context of social homeostasiswhether or not the analogy of socialinteraction to caloric intake if wecould is there another dimension to itwhere it's not just the total number ofcalories or the total amount of socialinteraction but the quality of socialinteraction the type of socialinteraction that actually feels likenourishment as opposed to just caloriesI love where you're going with this andand so um when we wrote this review thefirst time we know we're we're conceptuthis idea of of how your social setpoint can change based on if if you'reacutely isolated or or chronicallyisolated andum the Y AIS is the quality quantity ofdetected social contact which is sofuzzy and you know there's it's it'sagain one of the most challengingfrontiers of this field because how evenif we measure every single componentthat the brain can detect of the socialthe social contact so much of it isabout expectation you know like if Ithink I got a gesture if if I get a nodfrom the president I'm like oh my goddid the president just nod at me that'sso exciting versus if I get a nod frommy partner I'm like oh my God are theymad at me what's going on why why did Ijust get a nod right it totally mattersthe gesture you need the identitythere's manydifferent cognitive systems that need toall plug in to this wheel umto make it spin so I think that uh thatis one of the the I I think that's goingto keep us busy for awhile but in terms of your questionabout social media and when you switchfrom you know getting social mediafeedback and then doing work um I thinkI think it really depends I mean socialmedia is such a large category you canhave many different types of responsesgenerally I think the bounds so you knowwhen you say social media versus reallife interaction where you're withsomeone maybe you're touching maybeyou're not touching but even if you'rehaving conversation um you haveinterbrain synchrony you are um having alot of interbrain syn you're in the sameplace if but you can have interbrainsynchrony even on the phone right just avoice call is actually a lot moreinterbrain synchrony than than messagesI think I think text messages can bringa lot of anxiety and there's been a lotof commentary about that um and samething with with with social media Ithink the the thing about social mediathat is perhaps um themost harmful or NE negative I think interms of I when I'm thinking aboutsocial nourishment if I you know sort ofmaking that term up on the Fly here butum it's it's almost a withdrawal whensocial media is posted it's not to youit's to everyone and you could be one ofthe people that receives this messagebut it's not even what to you I'm notnot even talking to you and I'm doingsomething that's without you otherwiseyou'd be in this picture and not readingon social media listening to whatever soit's like by almost exclusively you'reyou're posting about activities thatyou're being excluded from and someone'snot even really talking to you unlessthey're D you know direct messaging youbut then I I kind of consider that adifferent category if it's like aonetoone communication social media tome is is a blast right it's not it'sjust you know catching up with someoneon social media I I don't really see theMerit of it because is I'll just catchup with them when I catch up with themand their kids will just be like wayolder but you know I don't know I'llactually really catch up with them thenjust see pictures of you know I don'tknow I I feel mixed about it becauseit's not a real connection and itdoesn't for me Sate my social appetiteto catch up with to to look at someoneelse's profile on on social media umthat doesn't actually do anything forthe the connection I I don't know but Iseriously doubt tons of oxytocin isreleased when I you know followsomeone's feed about their vacation so Idon't know I would I think that itdefinitely matters the quality andsocial media is is different than reallife interactions for many reasons I'dlike to take a quick break and thank our"

differenttime zones if you don't know someoneit's different context um so I'm reallythanks to what you're describing I'mreally starting to think about socialmedia as so different than in-personsocial interactions or by phone or videochat social interactions and how thosewould differentially impact socialhomeostasis and it's leading me at leastto conclude that at least for me thatmost social media interactions wouldcreate morehunger as opposed to a um sting of ofthe need for social interaction it's umI have to be careful with the analogieshere but since I can do this I I wasalmost going to make analogy between umporn pornographyuhhuh inperson sexual intimacy I supposethere's something in between wherepeople could talk by phone but we don'twant to explore this in any kind ofsalacious way and then um sexualintimacy with with uh with emotion withpositive emotion right those there's ascaling Factor there and I'm not P I'mnot putting um judgment or veilance I'mI'm certainly not that's not my place asa good friend of mine says I'm not a copyou know I'm not telling people what todo they can't do but it's so interestingto think about these um these circuitswithin us that create these what you andI in our field call repetitive thedesire for or aversive the desire tomove away from type responses and how somuch of our life aside from you becauseyou're regulating your social media andyour uh and your email intake but somuch of Life Now is offering us theopportunity to um tickle these circuitsor even hit them hard with asledgehammer but we're not thinkingabout these homeostatic mechanisms ofwhether or not they're creating morehunger for or more satisfaction fromyeah and I I I cannot emphasize enoughhow critical this is and I think that'sbecause you know I'm somebody who doesspend a fair amount of time on socialmedia a lot of my my work exists onsocial media YouTube Etc and I wouldhope that the work that we're puttinginto the world with this podcast iscreating a a satiation of the desire forinformation rather than a Hunger forMore I do hope that but I recognize thateducational material on social mediarepresents the the a tiny tiny fractionof what's there so social homeostasis Ithink is a term that if people haven'talready stamped into their mind theyshould be stamping into their mind andand Dr K Tai deserves credit for that Idon't uh I will say that so you don'thave toum I've heard you say before you wrotein a review something akin to socialcontact is either positive or negativewhen it's deficient or in excess whichis I think what you're describing is issocial homeostasis is that right when wetalked about the quality and quantity umthere's just in terms of contact justamount of contact there's such a thingas just the right amount there's something is too little there's such a thingas too much there's overcrowding rightit doesn't matter who it it can be yourfamily it could just sometimes it's likea lot maybe your family depends dependyou know the famous ROM dos quote nothink you're enlightened go spend aweekend with yourparents no no disrespect Mom and Dad Iknow right um butum I think with quality it matters somuch like I was sort of saying beforeyou know the same gesture from thepresident or my partner it's going tofeel very different to me whether thatwas a slight or uh you know it's justit's relative to what is appropriate forour rank for our prior historyrelationships for you know the theenvironmental context and so I thinkwith social media in general and I agreesocial media is great for a lot ofthings I mean I and I I I think thathaving a podcast like this that isaccessible to the public makes researchmore sustainable so I have a lot ofthings to say about sciencecommunication that I'm very you knowgrateful for but in terms of socialmedia think about the mutual investmentwhen you are interacting with someone onsoci social media what are theyinvesting in this connection so if I putout a post about my vacation that ispublic I'm investing00000000000000 one% of my bandwidth tomake contact with you you know what Imean and so it's it it scales up fromthem if if you're making a voice callwith someone you're giving them at leastmost of your attention for the time thatyou're on the call that's a lot rightwhereas you know so so just thinkingabout the investment is anothercomponent there's the real timecomponent and then there's the theinvestment component who is it comingfrom it matters if you're anonymous Ireally I cannot tell what this means youknow a compliment from an or or a hatehate comment or a love comment fromAnonymousperson I don't know what to do with thisyou like I just literally don't know howto you know it doesn't really doesn'treally do anything for me because Idon't know how to interpret it it'salmost you know uninterpretable withoutthis other dimension that my brain ishas evolved to look for I think sothat's you knowspeculation but I think social media isis operating in a way that that is notethological and not designed to make usfeel better it's just designed to makeus want to use it and I think a lot ofthis comes down to things that arerelative you know there's the famous umthere's the famous observations if of am monkey sees Another Monkey get acucumber it's happy with the Cucumberbut if a monkey sees the other monkeyget great grape monkey wants grape youknow you want you want to keep up withthe Joneses you want what if you seesomeone else having something suddenlyit feels like a loss that you don't haveit that you didn't even think that ofthis thing that you needed right and soI think social media is exposing you toa lot of things that you don't you knowthat it's it's like this this parameterspace you didn't have there's all thesethings you didn't know you were missingthat you didn't need to miss out on andso we have this whole project now wehave two projects one that's looking atsocial isolation and following whathappens with social isolation across thetime course to try to understand is itthe amount of time or is it the amountof effort that you put into correctingthat deficit um that that makes youleads you to the giving up you know kindof state change and another project thatum is about the quality of socialcontact specifically social exclusion soa different kind of deficit you're withyour other animals but there's this thisyou know it's four animals that have umare cagemates and um three animals areon one side able to drink a chocolatemilkshake and the other animals exexcluded and this one excluded animalwill go up against the the divider andand you know look look frantic and youknow ex exhibit lots of behaviors thatwe would associate in humans with fearof missing out trying to reunite withthe group trying to get the attention ofthe group trying to get over there a lotof attending looksfrantic and studying what we think isactually going on and so I think that Ithink coming up with paradigms to try toprobe social isolation and we don't evenknow what behaviors animals exhibit whenthey're lonely this is this is achallenging field because there's nonumber of lever presses you know there'sno there's no script to follow andthere's no trial structure and so for aneuroscientist NE neur scientists weretrained to be rigorous about ourstatistics because of the stochasticnature of neural neural activity and youknow how do we process things without atrial structure how do we bestatistically rigorous when the animalis just free floating deciding whateverit wants to do and so that is kind ofThe Crucible that my lab is is workingthrough right now to establish pipelinesand techniques and ways toquantify social behavor avors and peeloff all thelayers I love where your lab is headed"

wereally know how we feel about somebodywhen something good happens to them orfor them and I never quite understoodthis at the level of mechanisms howcould I it's not more my lab studies butyou know I think that there's a naturalsort of empathy if one is a healthy uhempathic person to seeing a member ofour own species and hopefully uh also toobserving the members of other speciesum you know experiencing some discomfortwe don't like that nor should we soanother human is in emotional pain rightum you know the whale or the Cry of lossis like one that just I think for anyperson who's empathically attuned isjust like uh or an animal you hear ananimal in pain like goodness I mean I'mnot here to diagnose sociopathy but ifif that doesn't evoke a at least somesort of response of like oh gosh likewhat I wouldn't do to remove that painthat their pain is your pain empathy umthat seems like a very reflexive circuitor at least I would hope so um but whensomebody experiences something positiveI think it's normal and healthy to tohave a um a graded set of responses ifit's somebody that we really love um wemay not even know them we think yeahlike you're you just reflexively happyfor them um somebody that we dislike Ithink there's a more natural tendency tobe like oh you know right you know as asopposed to if that person were in pain Iwould like to think that even if onedidn't like them that you would thinklike oh that that sucks I'm really sorryto hear that um so I feel like there'ssome asymmetry in these empathicinteractions they're both empathy onehas negative veilance pain the other onehas positive veilance another member ofour species or other species receivingreward and we can Delight in that I meanI I'm almost embarrassed to admit howmany freret and Otter and raccoonaccounts I follow because I love seeingthem eat I love seeing the little handsof the raccoons there's some greatraccoon accounts by the way um and IDelight in it I like Delight in it Iwant to see the raccoons win I don'tknow why I just I love animals and so Isuppose that's why um so do you thinkthat there that we are asymmetricallywired for this empathic Attunement umcan we observe that in other animals Irealize this might not be squarely inthe Wheelhouse of what your lab isfocusing on but I think it it relatesenough to the topics that we're coveringtoday that just you know if you'd liketo speculate um uh on what might begoing on there yeah I I I can definitelyspeculate something that we think abouta lot but again you know I there's somethere's some level of this which issemantics um I think of empathy as beingdefined as being able to understandanother animal's emotion and also takingit on so I think um something that's alittle bit different than emotionalcontagion right I see a panic I'm goinga group with P it's not the same thingas uh as as empathy um empathy is oftenused in in sort of certain contexts likefeeling sorry for someone and it's maybedifferent if for feeling happy forsomeone and this is something I was justtalking about with one of my graduatestudents the other day why is there isis there anasymmetry in in empathy for positive andnegative or is it just what we'vestudied it's easier to study this sothere's a number of you know we don'tknow the answer but I guess anotherconceptual framework to put out thereI'm not saying it's correct it's I thinkjust a a good tool for debate but umit's not so much that there's goodpeople and bad people and that goodpeople are empathic and bad peoplearen't uh so you it's not quite sosimple I I guess the way I think aboutit is whether you view this other socialagent as havingaligned goals or agendas as you or arethey adversarial so if they're ifthey're in in your alliance whateverthat means broadly defined versusadversarial you would have a differentfeeling and you know it's it's you seethis I guess I was just I was justwatching this okay this is just sort ofoversharing but this is a podcast not aa primary research Journal so I can justsay things right so I I watch some trashTV sometimes and you know these realitycompetition shows where it's like thenyou vote the two best friends intoelimination and they have to they haveto eliminate each other mildly sadisticbut you know then they're best friendsand they like like they you know andthen it's basically mutually exclusiveeither you can care about your friendand feel bad not wanting to send themhomeor you you kick it you just you know youit's game time and you you youand so you can see different individualswrestling with these two brain Statesand and how to like what to do but theyare essentially you know my my myspeculation is that viewing someone as acompetitor and they're an adversary theyare standing in the way of me gettingwhat I want you empathy goes down it'slike inversely correlated to empathy ifyou are viewed as a competitor so thingsthat would contribute to you creating amodel where an in a social agent it isan adversary as opposed to an apotential ally is really what it's goingto come down to to the degree that youfeel empathy you know like you thesecond someone you realize someone's outto get you no empathy no and no moreempathy for this person who I justrealized is out to get me or somethinglike that or you know uh in the case ofbeing isolated for a long period of timeyou've learned to exist on your own nowmaybe everyone's your competitor oradversary you know and none of you guysare really helping me do my day like Idon't really need you guys for anythingso so I'm eating this food or whateveryou know I think it just becomesdifferent um when you're part of anecosystem and you realize that you knowthere's consequences and there's there'sEV every action that you take you knowevery Act of altruism will be recognizedand there you know there's there'sthere's a there's some score being keptin your when you're part of a societyand um and then when you're when you'renot there's none there's there's none ofthat and so I think the degree to whichyou're integrated in society um it'salmost like the extracellular Matrix youknow this is a really this is an outthere analogy but you know when youthink about synapses being made umconnections between people there's alsoall the support material thatfacilitates certain patterns and certainconnections from happening or nothappening and and I think um that's it'sit's stuff that we haven't Quantifiedyet but it doesn't you know I thinkthose things should be studied years agoI worked with at risk kids and and afair number of them had just arrived umfrom a region of the world that hadundergone dramaticsociopolitical um Evolution um andchange and it was remarkable because wewould put out a tray of food to eat andthen the the format was everyone wouldserve themselves and then um you coulduh go get more food if if you ifeveryonefinished um and a couple of these kidsthat had come from these very deprivedenvironments um would just take a morethan their their share it was clear thatby taking that other kids weren't goingto get any and um and I remember tellingthem listen we all have to eat more orless equal parts and then we can thereis more we can get more and um I'llnever forget this kid's response he justturned to me and he said you can't hitus and I said that's true I can't hityou and he and he said so I'm just goingto take as much as I want and this tookseveral weeks actually to to work outright um CU of course I would never hithim and um but everyone's his adversaryeveryone's his adversary and it wasremarkable to see the evolution of thesekids across that it was about three anda half weeks um at which point theyactually becameincredibly um good at sharing um but itit took a lot of work it was almost asif even though they knew more tra offood could arrive yeah not Limitless butthere was there was an abundance of foodyeah in the moment they they weresolving for that short Horizon momentyeah and it and here we're talking abouthuman beings capable of speech andexpression of emotion Etc and heunderstood the fundamental rule whichwas I couldn't hit him therefore hecould basically do what he wantedwithout thatconsequence and which the mainconsequence he faced apparently exactlyand um and I remember you know it was itwas so striking I'll never forget thatand the evolution to a different more umaltruistic state was wonderfulespecially because of what I think whatit did for him but but I'll never forgetthinking this is a human being who'sessentially functioning like ananimal like an animal I mean I had aBulldog Mastiff and he was kind to otherdogs but if therewere unattended to toys at the dog parkhe was going to pick them up and he puthim right in front of himself and histhis was down San Diego and he sit withthem right in front of him and I'm likeCostello you're not going to play withall those toys but if another dog cameand and he wouldn't he would just sit infront of them but another dog would comeand try and take one of those toys andhe would he had these giant mitts and hewould just boom Stam it out and drag itback and so it seems that there arethese very primitive circuits about uhresource allocation and protection ofresources that in the absence ofunderstanding that there's a much biggerlandscape like Costello eventuallyfigured out like tug's a fun gamealthough most dogs couldn't play tugwith him there were a few that could hewas a 90b bulldog he was just a necklike this but you know to see this in ahuman being was just so striking I justas

food againit's about the relationships becausethat's your experiential statistics andso I think this is such a profoundconcept about about neuroscience and theBrain about our social structures andhow they form what makes a structureegalitarian ordespotic right like how how can we asindividuals take a structure that is isone format let's say despotic hierarchyand evolve it into something that's moreegalitarian and um what are what are thethe the levers and what are theparameter spaces that we can pull on andI think these are questionsthat I mean it's hard to think of whatcould be more important um but thatperspective of thinking about fromexperiential statistics I think reallysupports you know the need of of ofdiversity having bringing in people toAcademia whove had very differentexperiences experiential statisticsdifferent biases of what they're goingto think is interesting to work on andstudy and obviously in every everysector of our society so I thinkum how can we get more diverse sets ofexperiencesrepresented at each decision-making bodythat reallymatters yeah Amen to that and also to beable to understand that um differencesin background experience um require thatwe we earlier you mentioned theory ofmind this ability to get into themindset of others and and sort of assumeor presume certain mindsets in order tohopefully create a more benevolentenvironment for everybody umyou know it requires um you knowrealizing that some people's socialinteractions are you know have beenterrible or traumatic or um you know itrequires a departure from selfessentially it requires this empathy orsomething like empathy um in alldirections right I mean in alldirections it requires that everyone atleast makes some effort to try andunderstand that I do wonder and

at their school theydefinitely do get education about ummore holistic health and emotionalregulation I think and and consideringothers um that's been that's that's abig focus of the school and I

socialrank they I think naturally startedthink well where am I in this socialRank and um how do I feel about how thatrank is you know established and and allsorts of interesting and importantquestions um some people get very angrythat there are billionaires on thisplanet M especially given that in mostmajor cities you don't have to go veryfar to see people who have very limiteduhresourcesso social rank is something that um Ithink exists in every little niche likeyou know at work and maybe even in thefamily there's social rank um I have asibling I remember um who got more of aof a piece of cake like even a slightdifference in that you know wassomething that my older sibling wouldpoint out um because she was moreeffective at getting the slightly largerpiece of cake cuz I was until I was youknow big enough to offend for myself umand my friends with larger sibling poolsin their family it was especiallycompetitive yeah I don't if you've evergone to a meal with somebody who had alot of siblings they eat fast they theydifferent resource allocation methodsthan if they were an only child versusuh one sibling MH they there's variationhere I'm generalizing but um but yeahlet's talk about social rank what do weknow about how social rank is organizedin the brain how we perceive our ownsocial ranking and um yeah like what'sthe what's the modern science on thisstuff I find it fascinating um I'm notscared of any topic well most any topicand I think this is one that thataffects us all yeah I mean I'll firstsay that social rank is something veryspecific to a certain type of hierarchythat assumes a linear hierarchy whichsometimes forms but oftentimes there'sdifferent types of hierarchies that areflatter or more Amorphis it's not reallyclear who's who's the alpha on theplayground I don't know there's thisclick here there you know it can bedynamic right right it's Dynamic it'snot always organized as such but um ifyou get animals into a sort of smallspace um you will see in many speciesespecially with in the males um forminga linear hierarchy and um um we wantedto explore this and so I think one ofthe biggest challenges with studyingsocial Rank and this is something we'vestruggled with as well is how do youcontrol for theindividual identity versus the uh theactual rank so what I mean by this islet's say there's astudy that says um that you know neuronsin a certain brain region fire toanimals of different ranks according tothe rank fire most of the alpha lessless less less down to the rank you knowdoes that does that tell us that thisbrain region encodes social rank maybein a loose sense and I'm sure that whenrank issues come up a lot of the brainlights up for different comp differentreasons but for example let's say theamydala would respond more to the Alphamaybe because it inodes social rank butmaybe alsobecause whoever is the dominant is theone who's most likely to haveconsequences and so all of myinteractions with the alpha arerelatively High consequence and so I'msort of stressed out whenever I'mtalking about Alpha paying attention andyou know you remember all theinteractions you have with your bossmore so than you know someone elsethere's an attention hierarchysubordinates attend more to dominanceand so there's it's almost hard to makethis comparison because it's not allflat like the the clean experiment whichwe are still trying to do it's it'sdifficult to do the perfect experimentwould be if you take an individual andchange their rank so forexample um I like to use this examplewith Barack Obama so just indulge me Iknow that this is from a while ago butonce upon a time I met Barack Obama fora very brief moment when he waspresident and and maybe there's someneurons that light up oh wow you knowthere's the Barack Obama presidentneurons but if they are identity neuronsonce he was no longer president if I wasto be presented with Barack Obama thenthey would still fire if they wereranked Neons then maybe after he was nolonger president it just these neuronsfire to whoever is president now and soI think that experiment is verydifficult to do and has not been donebut we're working on it right now um inuh uh another experiment where we takeanimals and they're living in groups uhand we rank them all and then we rehousethem so everybody has a rank that theystart with then we put all the alphastogether put all the betas together Etcso that everybody forms a new rank thenyou have animals that went up a rankwent down a rank or stayed the same forevery group and so that's something thatwe're looking at right now so initiallyyou take a pool of animals and thenlet's say you got your number one two 3four just for sake of Simplicity let'ssay I take the number four lowest inthat hierarchy but now I make them thetop of a new hierarchy that's rightthat's right got it and so it's reallypreliminary and we'll see what happensbut we'reinvestigating it it seems that when youtakeAlpha's intermediates or subordinatesand put them together into newhierarchies it takes them differentamounts of time and then Dynamics arevery different in forming the newhierarchy and so in any kind ofpredictable way that you're willing toshare or is it just too early I thinkit's too early but I'll just say I guessit seems like theum the intermediates might be taking thelongest amount of time to form thehierarchy they don't know where they sitin the hierarchy they they were flexibleor something whereas the dominantsthey're going to Duke it out and thenyou know we're going to we're going tobattle there'll be defeat it's quick thefight doesn't last that longsubordinates you know I I I you know wehave to still observe this is all stillyou know being we'll see if everythingreplicates but certainly the Dynamicsare different what the exact readouts weyou know we're working on what thefeatures are what key features to to seebut it's kind of uncanny because theseare genetically inbred animals that areall hous in these should be all everyoneshould be the same theoretically butthis makes me think that during certaindevelopmental periods rank is shapingyour long lasting development I thinkit's a simple similar phenomenon perhapsto the older child younger childphenomenon where you know if you're theoldest you go into the world and youhave lots of different roles you mightbe the bottom you know you're going toplay on sports teams and be in differentclasses and have all these but the thethe leadership desire slash potentialskill seems to be correlated in a verynon-scientific way you know the numberof presidents that's often old oldest oronly children this type of thing it'sit's a loose correlation there's a lotof other reasons why it might not bebehavioral but there's sort of you knowfluffy fluffy correlations about that Ithink there's something to it though umwhen plasticity happening you're thisthis becomes your most familiar state ofassuming a certain role and thatattractor state deepens with more timespent there I find that so fascinatingI've also observed and I think I've seena few papers on I don't know howrigorous these papers are that umyoungest or let's just say not oldestsiblings um here we're setting asidesingle children that don't have anysiblings but that youngest siblings uhdo tend to quote unquote break the moldmore in terms of uh socio and culturalnorms of the family they they Venturefurther in terms of um experiences andsystems they're often seen as having hadfewer constraints than the older siblingwhich may or may not be true um but thatthe youngest

umbut and then but then there was times inour childhood where she was out of thehouse and I was at home just with my momso so that sort of changes things butand it's very Dynamic I realize

they they they don'tdon't outrank you at and and so how doyou work all of that out and so I thinkthat's also something about keepingscore like what is what is the rankright and so we did this experimentwhere we designed atask um animals are trained that a queuepredicts reward delivery only one animalcan get at a time it's just a verynarrow place so if one animal's gettingit you can't get it then um we wouldhave four animals that are CAG matesfour mice that are cagemates and wewould have two of them duke it out ateach point and they we know the ranksthe ranks are stable they have a rankone two three four in the cage andeverybody does a round robin ones versustwos ones versus threes two versus yeahthey well they they do round rabit inthis reward competition task they'refood deprived you know and we we presentrewards what's the what happens and sosubordinates do win some of the timeseven though dominants win more all youknow they they consistently win more andwe found that prefrontal corticalneurons you could represent very stablyand decode which animal wasdominant um flat regardless of the trialand then when you looked at whether wecould decode competitive success meaningwho is going to win that next trial sothere's a new trial every 30 or 40seconds and so but 30 seconds beforewhich is as far as we can measurebecause then we're like kind of into theprevious trial as soon as the last trialends even before the next trial ends Youcan predict above chancesignificantly which animal is going towin the next trial just based on thefiring pattern of prefrontal corticalter so you can predict winners andlosers you can predictand understand where they are in thehierarchy as well based on the ACTactivation of neurons prior to thebattle that's like recording from the umby analogy it's like recording from theprefrontal cortex of two let's saybusiness competitors or um martial artscompetitors and you can predict who'sgoing to win based on the pattern offiring in their brains prior to thecompetition that's right and so um thatsuggests all sorts of things number oneit doesn't mean these competitions arenot independent there's something aboutthe state of the animal and when welooked at is it just whoever won theprevious trial that did not account forthis and so um I thought this was reallyinteresting but when you look at thedecoding accuracy for dominants versussubordinates about uh who will win thenext trial for dominance it stays prettyflat it just has to do with I think thisis my speculation of our data um thatyou know they they either are engaged orthey're not engaged the subordinates thedecoding accuracy is is above a it'sabove chance but then it shoots upsomewhere around closer to the queuepresentation and so my speculation aboutthat is that the subordinates arelooking at the dominance they're lookingthe dominant doesn't look like they'reit doesn't look like they're going to gofor it okay yeah there there looks likethey're turning away I'm gonna go I'mgonna go so it's it's not like they'reboth going out full every time it's it'sa calculation which trials oh he's notpaying attention you know it's like whenyou're driving in traffic and you'retrying to find the the moment to cutover and you're waiting for the personwho's like te texting and there justthere's a big space and everybody's justgetting in right here you know you canjust see you're like looking for cluesabout the state of level you know ofcompetition and then and then thedominants they are not looking at thesubordinate they're just doing whateverthey feel like doing it's like a there'sa I think there's that one scene inMadmen where something happened in thework environment and um and it was clearsomeone's account didn't sell orsomething didn't work out for one personversus the other and I think one of thecharacters says to uh Don Draper who'sclearly one of the alphas in that workenvironment by virtue of yeah role andand um position um says you know youknow I sometimes think about the waythat you blank blank blank and blank andhe goes on this brief tiate about howupset he was and um and Draper says wellI don't think about you at all and thenthe elevator I believe closes and itreally cemented his status in the officeas somebody who's really not paying muchattention to what other people are doinghe's just making decisions according towhat's going to be best for the firm andin some cases for himself and in somecases both so I think that's essentiallywhat you're talking about yeah I thinkit's um it's kind of the nature of thestructure that's what makes you thealpha is you're you you have you haveother things that are occupying yourattention and your your Visionary statushopefully if you're you know aproductive successful Alpha and for asustainable you know group and theneveryone else is they don't they don'tneed to have the big picture they don'tthey don't you know it it becomes thereinforcement schedule is different I'mjust looking for validation am I am Iplaying my role okay it's a verydifferent mindset I think you know as ascientist when you're a traineesometimes you're a a supporting memberon a team where you're gettinginstruction someone's telling you whatto do versus the moment where you getyour own project and maybe you'reworking by yourself maybe there's no oneto command but no one's telling you whatto do that is to me one of the biggestthresholds to step over when you'rebecoming a scientist or an investigatoris the first time where you just dosomething and like try an experiment noone told you to do and it feels superweird it feels like you're sneakingaround or something and and then youknow I think I thinkum intoday's mentorship chain sometimes thatthat happens too late I think if wecould have that experience happenearlier um I think that would only begoodfor for the future of research I agree Iwas very fortunate that my graduateadviser um told me look I'm going tohelp you but I'm going to have two kidswhile you're in the lab and I'm notgoing to be around a lot so you're goingto have to figure it out don't burn thelab down don't kill yourself with any ofthe poisons in the lab and then my postttalk adviser um the late and great BenBaris um largely treated the postto asas Junior professor from an early stageand I remember thinking he can't controlthe experiments I'm going to do this isup to me and he and and a great numberof us who were training with him at thattime went on to have our own lab so Ithink um uh there's really somethingimportant to that model and of coursewe're discussing the research field butum this could be exported to any numberof different fields because what thosementors were essentially training us todo was to um to assume the role that wewould eventually have as opposed to besubordinatesum do you watch chimpEmpire so actually um just this weekyesterday and the day before before thisuh an postto interview who worked withthe chimps on chimp Empire visited aninterviewed him in my lab and um talkedabout his work so I have not seen chimpEmpire but it's at the very top of myto-do list oh God it's so good I don'twant to spend the next 20 minutestalking about it but you see all sortsof interesting um Behavior very relevanthuman behavior hierarchies yes but alsoum altruistic behavior um allopathicgrooming I mean in in chimp culture umas I've learned from the show assumingit's accurate um that who Grooms who isvery important um and there's all sortsof interesting um Maneuvers thatsubordinates make and there's all sortsof interesting displays of vigor thatthe alpha makes to remind people thatthey are the alpha and thenas they age or make mistakes of judgmentthe subordinates also will Faindeference they'll be like oh yeah you'rethe alpha you're really tough andsecretly they're plotting to replace thealpha um so whether or not we're talkingabout a scene from Mad Men or we'retalking about chimp Empire we're talkingabout Research Laboratories or um or anyother landscape kindergarten I thinkthese circuits are active in all of usand the sooner that we uh acknowledgethose and try and find um one thatgeneralize to the the goodness of asmany uh members as possible um we're notdoing our task but clearly you're doingthe task so okay social rank issomething that uh we need to acknowledgeno doubt um which actually leads me towhat might seem like a desperate topic"

            "text": "but um one that I know we're both veryinterested in and that you're focusingon now which is psychedelics because oneof the interesting things aboutpsychedelics is their capacity toincreaseneuroplasticity um but but also some ofthe psychedelics and I realize MDMA isnot a classic psychedelic but they areclassified as empathogens they increaseempathy for self and others so uh whatare you looking into with psychedelicswhich psychedelics and um yeah whatbrought you to the study of psychedelicsand by the way I've done participated inclinical because people will wonder Ihave participated in clinical trials foruh psilocybin and MDMA I don't recommendpeople do psychedelics Recreation I dothink they hold great promise for thetreatment of depression and trauma butpeople need to be careful there arecertain people who could not and shouldnot take psychedelics because it wouldbe genuinely unsafe for them umpsychologically especially young peopleso there's my disclaimer and um but theyare fascinating compounds so um I guessI've always been interested inpsychedelics I think I wrote myundergraduate thesis about it's justabout hallucinations produced bypsychedelics psychotic breaks and REMsleep and schizophrenia just comparingwhat is the common thread when our braincreates a reality that is notobjectively there and um psychedelics ofcourse is a way that we can experiencethat and remember it and recall it in away that's very difficult with REM sleepand and sometimes with psychotic breaksum obviously schizophrenia is notsomething that you can transiently giveyourself and have that experience so Ithink having the ability to move intoother brain States is what makes it soattractive I think the other componentis the the plasticity you can you canhave an experience and perhaps thefirsthand experience is you have anepiphany that you take with you it'slife-changing and you know your lifehabits are completely different for along lasting way after this singularexperience is is kind of one of thethings that makes it so different fromall of the other um therapeutictreatments that we've got or most of theother ones I'd say um and so for me youknow right now there's a lot of workgoingon exploring psychedelics as a therapyfor various different conditions diseaseStates um I think that's great I thinkit's really important work I'm glad alot is being done on that I think myfocusis is to turn over some rocks that mightnot have been turned over yet and justto get really down at a quantitativerigorous mathematical level of what is ahallucination for example um when Iasked this question what is ahallucination I'm interested in theactual cellular mechanisms are we justyou know we think about neurons havingsignal to noise and neurom modulation aschanging that are we just changing thesignal to noise ratio and then patterncompleting all the noise and that's whata Hallucination is we just you know takethat's we're just reinterpreting noiseand and putting sort of existing Mapseverything's fitting to existing mold ormap that we've already got that thenappears as somehallucination um or is and and and youknow maybe it doesn't have to behallucination there's also obviouslysome various different thresholds of thePsychedelic experience um but all theseclinical statements this humanself-reportedum Quality ative descriptions of thePsychedelic experience things like beinghaving just more positive outlook beinguh uniting one self and other like asort of you know Clarity of the worldum more labile in thoughts more flexiblethoughts uh we are trying to justcreate actual ways to test them so forexample this idea about what is what isgoing on in your mind when you whenyou're having a psychedelic experienceall of these different states might feelmore labile um it maybe the transitionprobabilities between different brainstates of like happy sad thinkingnostalgic you know maybe it's just alllooser and so you can access everythingbecause the transition probabilities arejust High another possibility is thatand maybe it's dose dependent at acertain dose you go into another brainState and sopreviously we've done this in the sameproject I was just about rank um we wererecording for prefontal cordal neuronsand looking at all the behaviors and sothe behaviors for representing socialrank we don't know what they are so weused computer vision to extract a bunchof Behavioral motifs and then tried tounderstand what's the best model thatwould predict you know what the animalis going to do next not just wins andlosses but all the subtle gestures arewe going to fight are we going to giveit up are we going to back off andpredict the behaviors from prefrontalcortical activity and the best modelthat we found with something called ahidden maravian model which essentiallyjust means that there are hidden Statesyou might think of them as moods um youmight give them some other name but I'llI'll I'll use moods Loosely it's notperfect but um that's kind of one waythat helps me think about hidden stateswhere you have certain statistics ofbehaviors that you would produce if I'msad there's certain things I'm going todo it's a different statistics and ofwhen I'm happy different probability ofgoing surfing if I'm sad or happy or youknow things like that so we basicallyfound that there are a certain number ofhidden States and so if you are onpsychedelics would that change thenumber of states or just the transitionsbetween them we also found in ourprefrontal cortical representation thatthere's a certain distance of therepresentation of self and other in thisyou know dimensionality reduced activityspace so for mumbo jumbo that just meansthere's a representation of self andother there's some quantifiable distancein inabstract you know terms in the brain andwe can quantify if those representationsget closer together and merge of selfversus other of self versus other sothat's something that we would want wewould be looking for if you are puttingpsychedelics on these are these arequestions that I'm interested in thatare under construction so right nowwe're recording fromum animals while we're giving them cybinusing neuropixels recordings sorecording from thousands of neurons umin preal cortex and other parts ofCortex cuz the you know the shank goesto lots of places and looking at how umanimals respond in a conflict task sothere's there's trials where there's aQuee that predicts reward a queue thatpredicts shock then there's some trialswhere both cues are presented and bothoutcomes are presented and the reasonfor this conflict trial is that actuallyif you give you know moderate to lowdoses of psilocybin or most drugshonestly animals can do thisyou know even on lots of different drugsmost people can still eat food and avoidgetting hit by this truck I mean thereare exceptions of course but generallyspeaking you know there's a lot ofdifferent brain states where you canstill do these these essential functionspretty robustly but it's about whathappens in the more ambiguous Zone whathappens when there's a conflict and andwhat do you do how do you when therewhen it's a little gray I think that'swhen you can see a shift in veilanceassignment so that's something thatwe've been looking for and trying to seeif um you know in clinical studiesthey're exploring set and setting um asmaybe the factors that have in the pasthistorically given very unpredictableoutcomes for psychedelic therapies umit's possible that it's set in settingit's also possible that there'sindividual variability it's possiblethat there are biomarkers that canpredict which individuals would be wellsuited for this type of therapy and sothose are also things that we'reinterested in I find this so fascinatingand I I just want to applaud you againfor taking on these hard questions theseare fairly high level questions umcertainly there's a lot of uh clinicaltrials exploring psychedelics likepsilocybin and their role in treatingmental health um and there's at the sametime um a real dir of studies exploringmechanistically how these compounds areworking I mean um I do want to tip myhat to all the folks that have exploreddendritic changes and you know socellular changes in the level of neuronsand and on and on but in terms of theselike higher level states of um selfversus other recognition um inpsychedelics um you know that those aretough questions that need to beaddressed mechanistically and it's clearyou're doing that um I I think this umthis notion that you're testing ofwhether or not psychedelics reveal moreaccessibility or liability as youdescribed it of between different stateslike oh wow I can actually move from sadto Happy there's a there's a route forthat and you can experience that asopposed to just being told that hey whenyou're feeling sad feel your you knowthe field of psychology especially poppsychology is in a real crisis right nowin my opinion because we're told to feelour feelings but then we're also told tonot react to our feelings which soundsgreat but if those feelings get intenseenough that's very hard for most peopleto do so it's feel your feelings butdon't stay with you know what there'sthe cathartic model you know like feelyour feelings and and get them outscreaming and Etc and then there's thethe no you know the more you engage aneural pathway the stronger that neuralpathway gets and therefore you're justgoing to feel more anger there's a lotof conflict right now in terms of thepopularpsychology version of this whereas thethe clinical Fields I think have a anunderstanding that hasn't beentranslated I think one other thing aboutpsychedelics that is interesting is thatthe transitions into States is also morelabile like if you start feeling alittle sad you know there's thepotential to feel very very sad and togo into a state of sadness of of anintensity you've never experiencedbefore which by the way could betherapeutically beneficial um I thinkthere's some evidence for that providedthere's adequate support before duringand after those sessionsum but I think most people feel whenthey're not on psychedelics will feelemotions that are uncomfortable andwill'll do all sorts of things to tryand avoid those emotions so I I'm notspeaking as a clinician here but I justagain I think what the the uh the rangeand specificity of questions that you'reasking about psychedelics I I find soexciting another uh uh reason I'll saythat you we want to have you back to todiscuss those findings when that whenthey come out let's talk a little bitabout you okay um I've known you for a"

intellectual slashother conversations of of substantialdepth that I wouldn't have theopportunity to haveelsewhere I know enough about youhowever to know that um you've beeninvolved in various things um I'm notgoing to say peripheral to science butyou have other interests as well um as Irecall um you have been a yogainstructor or a or you've been involvedin the uh kind of wellness fitness uhCommunity industry tell us about thatand then I'm also curious about um howyou structure your day your routinesgiven that you're a parent of two youngchildren you run a very large laboratoryoperating at the very highest level umand of course you value important thingslike relationships and relationship toself and health and all these sorts ofthings so um not to make it tooopen-ended but yeah like tell us of tellus of your interests and and of yourrelationship to Wellness and fitness andwell-being yeah um I guess Ithink you know I everybody comes totheir their calling in in some whatfeels like a path that you could havepredict but when you look at it outsideI guess both of my parents areprofessors so it doesn't look supersurprising that I'm a professor butthat's not how it felt to me when I wasin high school I was a total rebel Ijust threw parties at my house myparents weren't there sorry everybodywho's listening it's not I don'trecommend that but I just cared about Ijust cared about having fun and sportsandum Ithink school wasn't maybe challengingenough for me at that time I didn'tnecessarily recognize that that was whatit was but um I've always enjoyed beingreally active and that's what makes mefeel good it's I I I definitely um agreewith stuff you've said on your podcastabout having exercise routines in themorning that really influence the restof your day I I didn't always exercisein the morning at different phases butum yeah after I was an undergrad I tooksome time to travel around Australiabackpack around Australia live in somevery remote places spend some timeliving in a tent then I was a yogainstructor um then I I went to gradschool in the Bay Area I had a veryactive uh hobby of I was asemi-professional break dancer I wasvery into break dancing really reallycompetitive break dancer in area yes wedid um you know halftime shows or Iguess technically third quarter timeoutshows at Oracle Stadium for the GoldenState Warriors I was the one girl whocould do a windmill so they would use meokay windmills someone's going to findfootage of this yeah yeah there's someyou know very mediocre footage of mebreak dancing um and I was just reallyinto it but I think that's where my worklife balance passion comes from I talkabout it a lot I think about it a lotand people say to me all the time wellyou is this really true why do you whydo you preach all this work life balancestuff when you know you must have been aworkaholic at some point in your lifeand I think you know when I was youngerI definitely didn't like the idea thatyou had to only be one thing I wanted tobe so many things I couldn't decide itwas a huge challenge I was going to be awriter I was going to be a yogainstructor I was going to be I neverreally thought I was going to be aprofessional dancer I just wasn't goodenough and there's not careers to bemade from dancing really it's verydifficult but um you know had a lot ofother interests and I wanted toprove I don't know who I wanted to proveit to I think myself at first and theneventually it made me May me feel like Ishould maybe prove it to everyone thatyou can have a very whole life and notsacrifice everything you don't have tochoose between family and career orpersonal life you can have them all youjust have to decide that it's a priorityand own that and make those choices onon a daily basis and comes down to timemanagement and so it's been a very eventhough it looks like oh K just likes tohave fun and have all these otherHobbies it it's it's important because Ithink that we need more role models inespecially in academic science wherepeople bring their whole selves to theirjob and even though your job is a veryspecific thing um because you have arole as a mentor and you know I supposethe mentor apprenticeship relationshiphas evolved then there's I have you knowlots of comments about that too um inAcademia I still think ultimately whenwhen I was working in someone else's laband I definitely looked up to them theywere the role model obviously I'mlooking at yes there science I'm lookingat how they make this all work how youhow are you doing this how how do theylive their lives and how do theyapproach balancing it all and so I guessI just wanted to put some more datapoints on the on the scoreboard wherepeople are having lots of hobbies andother nonwork activities while stillmaking meaningful contributions and itdoesn't make you less of a less of ascientist or less of a person becauseyou're a wholehuman if anything perhaps it makespeople better scientists yeah

great uh pleasure in askingthis because um you know it wasn't longago that you and I were graduatestudents in postdocs and more or lessthe same vintage right and as is thecase people retire people die this isthe reality of life and people move upup the ranks as you have um so what aresome of the things that you're mostpassionate about in terms of shaping thefuture of science um in particularresearch science but maybe more broadlyand um what do you doing about it Ithink thatum science academic culture hasevolved and and I guess I should startby just saying first I as I was drivingover here it's just beautiful drive andI'm just thinking it is so cool that weget to do this for a living isn't itamazingthat studying whatever I findinteresting to me is something that Ican you know have a secure job for andthen just thinking about cool ideas anddirections and talking about it stuffthat I would do for free is is really myjob and I I just am so grateful to havethat and um um I think there are a lotof beautiful sides of Academia thatsometimes don't get the airtime thatthey deserve and of course there's a lotof Doom and Gloom there always has beenwhen I was a grad student there's lotsof Doom and Gloom in The Ether there'splenty now um I think perhaps it hasbecome a little bit more dire um theplight of Academia right now uh there'sbeen a nationwide drop of posts ingeneral there's just a mass Exodus awayfrom Academia to Industry and I thinkthat reflects the changing environmentand so um I guess when I was a graduatestudent I had this book in my deskdrawer called advice for younginvestigator written by ramonica Hallwhich is a great book it's thin it's aquick read it's got some whims Whimsicalanecdotes and some some some importantinsights I think um also a lot ofmisogyny very much glamorizing workworkaholic Tendencies and you there wasdefinitely a picture of a scientist thiswas the way to succeed other options notreally offered and and I reallystruggled with that I had a lot ofimpostor syndrome coming up through Imean I someone asked me when when did Iwhen did I stop having impostor syndromeI think maybe2021 you know very recently I think Ispent 20 years of my career havingimpostor syndrome wondering if I wasgood enough if I was going to make it amI going to do I have what it takes andconstantly doub Ting and questioning itum and I think that it would have beennice to to not feel so alone at thatperiod of of my career um so I thinksome of the things that were describedin this original book um were reallyimportant for academic research to beborn as a thing like how do we make thisbe a thing that you can get paid for youknow how do we make this be a job thatpeople get to have and then at thispoint I think most people would agree weneed science science is important wewant to we want to we benefit fromscience um and I think at this pointit's not so clear that we need elitismas much as we did before it's not umwe're we're looking at a crumblingacademic culture where where we'restruggling to retain people and you knowthat's it's not it's not a greatsustainable Dynamic I think trainees arenot getting compensated well enough ortreated treated well enough that it's anattractive choice and so I think we needsort of make a change and nothing wrongnecessarily about about the intentionsthat were set hundreds of years ago butthings change and where where we are nowand things are changing veryquickly so um I I guess I get to makeone of my childhood dreams which is toto write a book come true um in uh I getin and one of the benefits of socialmedia I did have a tweet kind of youknow just sort of spontaneously rantingabout about how this book is problematicand it's verymisogynistic and maybe we need anotherbook for other types of people um andthat makes people feel moreincluded um and so and and this tweetwent around and it s I didn't expect youknow I didn't expect anything to come tothis I'm just you know living my dailylife and then my DM suddenly hadliterary agents and a book deal and thenokay I'm now I'm writing this book andso I'm at about halfwaythrough but I think the the goal of thebook I I don't really have time for thisproject to be honest but it's such animportant project to me um I thinkthatI I want to see Academia be a one of thehealthiest places why is it second onlyto the military in the pervasiveness ofsexual misconductand you know things yeah y did you knowthat so actually you know factoid isAcademia is the military is worse interms of sexual misconduct retaliationissues that occur but Academia secondand I and it makes you wonder what arethe parameters thatmake this type of abuse so rampant Ithink one of the obvious ones is theclear ranks how stable the rank ranksare how the power structure um ofAcademia and the military veryy fixednot super debatable not difficult tomove these the ranks are you knowthey're there and the power structure isvery skewed and those are theingredientsthat facilitate abuse and so Ithink in themilitary I could see a very goodargument for why that hierarch thatstrict rigid hierarchical structure isnecessary there's not time for makingmistakes get it but withAcademia there's there's time there's wewhat do we we're not you know it's not awar we're we're just studying stuff thatwe think is cool why is uh such a rigidhierarchy with such devastatingconsequences necessary I would arguemaybe it's not and um I think I've beenspending a lot of time thinking aboutthis for myself I've been um I I foundthis professional leadership coach I Ilove and just thinking aboutsustainability how do we make an asustainable ecosystem and um it's notsomething you find in a lot ofleadership management uh literature thatI that I've been exposed to so I'll takeI'll take a note from from the thepodcast and say if anyone knows ofliterature that talks about developingsustainable um ecosystems withinleadership and management I would loveto hear about that in the comments butum I think that's a big hole um peoplethink about making things stable thepower structure should be stable butactually being flexible and dynamic iswhat gives systems resilience and andflexibility um to to survive and rightnow all the cracks in in the towers ofAcademia are showing and it's time to tosee if this is are we going to adapt andsurvive or are we

    "episode_summary": "In this episode, my guest is Dr. Kay Tye, PhD, Professor of Systems Neurobiology at the Salk Institute for Biological Studies and a Howard Hughes Medical Institute (HHMI) Investigator. We discuss the neural circuit basis of social interactions and loneliness. We also discuss how animals and people establish themselves in a group hierarchy by rank and how the brain responds to dominance and subordination.\nMuch of our discussion relates to how social media impacts our sense of social connectedness or lack thereof. The topics covered in this episode are directly relevant to anyone interested in the neuroscience of mental health, work-life balance, abundance versus scarcity mindset, and interpersonal dynamics.\nFor show notes, including referenced articles and additional resources, please visit hubermanlab.com.\nThank you to our sponsors\nAG1: https://drinkag1.com/huberman\nEight Sleep: https://www.eightsleep.com/huberman\nLevels: https://levels.link/huberman\nLMNT: https://drinklmnt.com/huberman\nInsideTracker: https://insidetracker.com/huberman\nMomentous: https://livemomentous.com/huberman"
