            "text": "welcome to the huberman Lab podcastwhere we discuss science andscience-based tools for everyday lifeI'm Andrew huberman and I'm a professorof neurobiology and Ophthalmology atStanford school of medicine today myguest is Dr David Linden Dr David Lindenis a professor of neuroscience at JohnsHopkins school of medicine hislaboratory has studied neuroplasticitythat is how Connections in the BrainChange in response to experience much ofthat work focused on a structure calledthe cerebellum which is also sometimesreferred to as the mini brain because itlooks like a mini brain in the bottomand back of the human brain and it'sresponsible for an enormous number ofbasic functions that we use in everydaylife including our motor behavior thatis our ability to walk and talk but alsodance play instruments and it'sresponsible for an enormous number ofbasic functions that we use in everydaylife including our sense of balance ourability to learn new motor behaviors aswell as our sense of timing today wewill discuss the cerebellum and what itdoes but Dr David Linden will also teachus about the important sense of touch aswell as what makes us different asvisuals the reason today's discussionencompasses so many important topics isthat Dr David Linden's laboratory hasfocused on many of those topics and heis also the author of five excellentpopular books about Neuroscience thatfocus on for instance our sense ofpleasure and where it originates fromand what controls it in the brain aswell as our sense of touch and today westart off our discussion by talkingabout the recent discovery of a set ofneurons that have been known about for along period of time but that onlyrecently have been characterized thatare involved in sensual touch inparticular and it's a fascinatingconversation I assure you in addition tothat Dr David Linden informs us aboutwhat makes us individuals how each andevery one of us perceives the samethings differently and it's anabsolutely fascinating conversationwhich tells you for instance why some ofyou think a smell is putrid indeedsmells like vomit whereas others perhapsare not bothered by that smell and whyothers still are attracted to that smellor something that you look at orsomething that you hear we also talkabout nature versus nurture and how wecome to be who we are not just throughour genes and epigenetics but alsothrough our early childhood experienceand adult experience and then in thelatter third of our conversation weshift to talking about the so-calledmind-body connection and the scienceunderlying how our thoughts inform ourbodily health or lack thereof as well ashow the organs of our body control thechemicals hormones and thoughts withinour brain then we shift to discussing DrDavid Linden himself and the fact thatin 2020 he was diagnosed with a form ofheart cancer that led his Physicians totell him that he had six to 12 months tolive now obviously because he was in ourstudio to record this conversation hehas outlived that prognosis but he livesday to day with the knowledge that hisdeath may very well come soon althoughit isn't clear exactly when that daywill come of course he tells us how theinitial prognosis of his cancer as wellas outliving that prognosis has informedhis day-to-day life as well as histhinking and his relationships and thatleads to a very direct and franklyemotional conversation that includesadvice on how all of us can get the mostout of our daily living and out of ouroverall life it's an extremely powerfulconversation that I believe everyoneregardless of age or health status canbenefit from and it's one that makesclear that not only is Dr David Linden aspectacular scientist but also aspectacular educator a spectacularpopular writer a spectacular Family Manincluding husband and father and friendto many people and his colleagues but heis also a courageous and spectacularlygenerous human being before we begin I'dlike to emphasize that this podcast is"

            "text": "been looking forward to our conversationand we have a lot to talk about we dolots of different aspects of sciencelots of different aspects of personaljourney and what you're confronting nowas it relates to your health and yourfutureI want to start off with a question thatI learned from the one and only thegreat Carl dyseroth who was the firstguest on this podcast my colleague atStanford and for those of you that don'trecognize Carl's name he is a absolutePhenom he's aactive clinical psychiatrist so he's anMD and he also is a bioengineer who'sdeveloped a lot of the modern tools forprobing the brain and um anytime I'vemet with Carl the first thing he says iswhat are you most excited about latelythat's a good question it is uh so I'mgonna steal that approach and say whatare you most excited about latelywell very very lately the mostinteresting thing that I read inNeuroscience is the answer toa a scientific problem that I think isreally dear to a lot of people's heartsand that iswhat are the nerve endings in thegenitals that are responsible for sexualsensationand you know if you think about it rightpeople can feel sexy from being touchedon lots of different parts of the bodybut there's something special about thegenitals doesn't matter male or femaleor intersex or gay or straight or bi orwhatever you are you know the genitalsare are a hot spotand why and you you'd think asbiologists we'd know this by now thiswould be something we could just answerbut but it's been a mystery for a longtime and if you go back to to 1860 therewas a German neuroanatomist named Kraussand he cut thin sections of tissue fromthe penis and the clitoris and he lookedat them under the microscope and he sawa particular kind of nerve ending therethat has since been called the Krauscorpuscle and there were lots of them inthese two places and so he thought wellmaybe this is the cellular basis ofsexual sensation maybe these are theparticular nerve endings that areresponsibleuh for thisum butthere were some things that that were infavor of that and some not so thesenerve endings are also in some otherplaces that people can findmore or less sexy like they're in thenipples and they're on the lips andthey're in the anus all places that getpopular in uh in that domain but they'realso in places like the cornea or thelining of the joints so distributiondoesn't quite make sense uh and so itwas never known and so if you wanted toreally test as a scientist whether thesenerve endings are responsible you wantto record their electrical signals whilethe genitals are being touched you'dwant to inactivate these cells and seeif you could interfere with with uhsexual sensation and this in a pre-printfrom David ginty's group at Harvard isjust what they have been able to do inmice they found a way to label andrecord from and activate and inactivateartificially uh The Krauss corpusclesand so you see a nerve ending in theskin it could be convey angle kinds ofinformation it could be tuned for hot orfor cold or for itch or for pain or forin or for inflammation or for mechanicalSensations stretching vibrationindentation and sure enough when theyrecorded from these Kraus corpusclesthey really are mechanical sensors asyou would expect uh if they wereinvolved in sexual sensation so that wasgoodand then uh the other thing then thatthey did is they they tried toartificially turn them on and so the waythey did that is they used genetictricks to express one of Carl diceroth'suh uh molecules that activates neuronswhen they're when blue light is shown onthem and they found that if they expressuh uh this artificial protein in thecross cells in a in a male Mouse andthen shine blue light the mouse gets anerection all right so far so good whathappens if you turn them off well if youturn them off in a male Mouse it's justas interested in females when they're inheat but it won't mount and thrust andejaculate as much and if you turn themoff in a female Mouse during the time ofher cycle where she would normally besexually receptive uh you find that sheis much less interested she's much lesslikely to let him out she's much lesslikely to let him finish so this is theremarkable resultsthat uh finally after all these yearssince 1860 now we know what the nerveendings are that convey sexual sensationand like all good science then you knowthere are a lot of questions that arereally interesting to our everyday liveslike you know people like differentthings in bed and have differentpropensity for orgasm or or like like tobe touched in different ways well ispart of that reason because ofindividual variation in their Krausscorpuscle structurewe know that sexual sensation diminisheswith aging is that in part because Krauscorpuscle density is lost from the skinof the genitals and that's a reasonableidea because we know for example thatfine touch sensors in the fingertipsso-called Merkel and Meisner endingsalso named after German anatomists likeso many things are are also lost withage so that's a reasonable idea so sothis finding from ginty's Lab has openedup a whole world of science and I'vebeen my my own lab doesn't work on touchbut I've been a fanboy of touch for formany many years mostly because where Iwork at Johns Hopkins Medical Schoolthere have been many terrific touchresearchers it's been a world center forit and I hear about it over lunch and Igot all fired up so years ago I wrote abook about it I still follow the fieldand this is the most interesting thingin that field recently and as I recallginty was your neighbor at Hopkinsbefore he moved to Harvard that's rightthat's right he was one of the onesginty uh uh Stephen Shao MichaelKatarina xinjiang dong there have been anumber of world leaders in in thecellular basis of sensation at Hopkinsdo you recall if in the pre-print thatyou were describing there was anexperiment where they activated theseKraus core particles in females it'sfunny you should mention that I sentthat exact email to David ginty and theysaid they are in the process of doingthat right now and they don't quite knowyet and so I asked him I said so forexample is erection of the clitoris evena thing in mice he says well we'rereally not sure so we're activating theKraus corpuscles in female mice andwe're just kind of staring at it andlooking and see if anything happens justthere is you know does the you know doesthe the body change shape is there acolor change they don't even quite knowwhat it is they're looking for becauseit's that much on the Leading Edge ofthings but it's a good question orperhaps the female mice would be morewilling to mate outside of the usualtime frame of receptivity if uh theseKraus corpuscles are are stimulatedthat's possible my suggestion my myguess would be not because I think thatthe hormonal regulation of receptivityis like a sledgehammer and very hard toovercome but they might be more willingto continue mating or make for longerduring their fertile time and I justwant to remind people because we had aguest recently uh Dr Rina Malik who's aurologist reproductive and sexual healthexpert she's an MD and um she made clearthat the the clitoris and the penis comefrom the same embryonic origin they areanalogous tissues in differentindividualsI do have one more question about this"

            "text": "your recent book and the sort ofunderlying basis of what led you towrite it andwhat intrigued you about this idea ofhuman individuality the book unique isone that we'll provide a link to in theshow note captions and umit's a very interesting idea that we areall different especially coming from aneuroscientist who were trained at leastsimilarly to learn that sure the bumpsand ripples of the brain and the finewiring of the brain is different and weare all unique and different we havedifferent shapes AKA morphologies butfocusing on human individuality is notsomething that modern Neuroscience orclassic Neuroscience has really donemuch of it's really focused on howpeople do X or people do y this wayum tell us about unique and tell usabout human individualityyeah well I mean you're absolutely rightso when I look at the experiments in myown lab how do we do them well we workon mice do we work on mice with geneticvariation no we work on highly inbredmice that are designed to be asgenetically similar to each other aspossible and then we raise thembasically in prism in little littlecells which may not be a good idea andwe try to give them a similar experienceas possible they are given toys and foodand water but I agree it resemblesum a prison of sorts they aren't free toroam they're not they have nothing likethe experience of a wild mouse let meput it that way they're uh uh and andyes there are as you said correctlythere are plenty of experiments wherethere is enrichments uh for mice andthey love it so for example in our labwhen we put running wheels in the cagesor mice and let them run overnightthey're active at nightum your average Mouse will run twokilometers in a night for a little timeand some of the mice are so intense theywill run 20 kilometers imaginea mouse doing 20K but but it will happenthey really really like it they don'tlike being in prison they want toexercise and they're really bored soyes to get back to your general Point uhso much of science is designed to try tofind generalprinciples ofof function of the brain a physiology ofgenetics uh and to ignore individualvariation but individual variation is soimportant to our human experience andactually is so important to to theprocess of evolution and naturalselection and how how species uh maketheir way in the world that thatit's it's something that that requires alot of attention and to me what's reallyfascinating is that when you look at thevariation in the way sense organsfunction it's almost a miracle that wecan agree on a common reality at alleven within the human species and thisis true of of more of of of some sensesmore than others obviously in your worldin the retina we have various kinds ofof loss of color vision uh that are wellknown and some other more complicatedphenomena having to do with uhimpairments in the perception of motionor form but uh the place where thisreally happens is in the uh olfactorysystemso we have approximately 400 functionalreceptors for different odorant moleculesmells uh in our nose and if yousequence the genomes of many people youfind that the uhthat the the DNA that encodes for theseodorant receptors is unusually variablefrom Individual to individual as amatter of fact if you taketwo different peopleon average they will have functionaldifferences in 30 percentof their odor receptorsand if you do as Leslie vossel and hercolleagues did at Rockefeller Universityand give odor tests where they givepeople different things to smell andthen they dilute them and find thethreshold which they can detect them youfind enormous changes from People toPeople both in term in general termssome people are just better smellersthan others but in terms of individualodors as well there's some odors thatsome people can't detect and otherpeople smell one way for example thereis a uh there's a secreted hormonecalled androstenoneandrostenone there are some people whocan't smell it at allfor some people uh it smells like ratherPleasant like cut grass and for somepeople it smells foul like urine orsweat and it just depends on geneticvariation in one particular odorantreceptor sorry to interrupt uh anotheruh phenomenal researcher who studiesolfaction among other things Catherinedulockum I once heard say that some peoplehave a gene thatfor them makes the smell of microwavepopcornthey experience that smell as vomit andother people who lack this Gene like thesmell of microwave popcorn or at leastfor them it's not aversive so it canreally be a binary response well it canactually that's a very particular funnycase so the the relevant chemical thereis butyric acid and also isovolic acidand so uh there are uh researchers Ithink Rachel Hertz uh is one of them whohave given a mixture of these twochemicals to people if they say this isparmesan cheese they go oh yeah that'sparmesan cheese and if they give it toother people and say this is vomitthey'll go oh yeah that's vomit and ifthey tell people they give them one vialand say this is parmesan cheese and theygo yeah and I get another one they sayit's vomit oh yeah and then they saywell actually we fooled you it was thesame vial they said no you didn't youmust have made a mistake they'reconvinced that they couldn't have beenthe same thing so this points out notonly is there genetic very nation thatuh is responsible for our ownindividual's perceive odor but we areincredibly suggestiblein terms of odors and we we are verydependent upon them in terms of culturalcontext uh and and this can be this canbe learned and and this is Central toour Humanity in the sense that that wehumans are what I like to call theanti-pandasuh pandas live in one spotuh in in southern China and they eat onething bamboo and that's it humans arethe opposite humans canlive in any ecological niche in theworld from the tropics to the poles andhumans eat a wide wide wide variety offoods and as a result it means that wehave to have a very plastical factorysystem that have to be very few thingsthat we find innatelyaversive they're only a handful of odorsrotting meat odors uh molecules with theevocative names like cadaverine andputresine are things that even babieswhen they're newborn find aversive butother things happen that they need to belearned for exampleumpretty much every adult finds poop odorsuh unpleasant but babies happy tohappily play with their own poop theyhave to learn that that's disgustingit's not because babies have a differentnose it's because they have to learnculturally not innate it is not innateum there are only a few innate odoraversions and a few innate taste orversions that were were born with andthe other things are elaboratedculturally and we can think about thisin terms of how we we we we talk aboutodors so for example we might sayvanilla smells sweetwell that's weird that's like those aretwo different senses how can somethingsmell sweet it's like saying it soundsred right it's a statement aboutsynesthesia right and but but how did itcome to pass and do people say thatvanilla smells sweet everywhere in theworld well the answer is noso in places in the world where vanillais used with sugar in in sweet foodslike desserts then people say thatvanilla smells sweet or mint similarlyuhsmell sweet if it is typically usedtogether with sugar but if you go to aplace like uh like Vietnam where mint ismostly used in Savory dishes peoplewon't say that mintsmells sweets so there's a parrotAssociation there that at least at ourlevel of conscious understanding feedsback onto what we callolfactory or smell perception but reallyit's a it must be a parrot Associationat some point in development yeah it isit absolutely is a paired Associationand it's something that goes oncontinuallythrough your life right I mean lots ofpeople for example have stories of foodsthat they wouldn't eat as a child butthey came to like as an adult a goodexample of that is coffeea lot of people have to overcome bitteraversion to uh to become coffeeaficionadosso uh you know this this feeds into themore the more General themethatthere is no pure perception perceptionis inference it's not like there is apurelyobjective world that can somehow makeits way through the senses and we canperceive that as the truth all of ourperception through all of our sensesboth the outward pointing senses of theworld like smell and taste and sight andhearing and the inward pointing senseslike balance and uh is my stomach fulluh and things like that all of them arebased on experience and

was the other wayaround excuse me it was red blue red andumI asked which ring is in front or arethey all at the in the same plane now ofcourse it's a two-dimensional imagerightum andinterestingly it splits out into aboutthirds some people see the blue ring infront quite a bit others see a red ringout in front others see them all in thesame plane and this uh we think has todo with differences in two thingsbetween individuals one is thedistribution of the cone photoreceptorswhich we know is essentially randombetween individuals maybe even betweenthe two eyes and then um and that givesrise to this phenomenon of chromaticaberrationum which is the displacement of thevisual image according to the wavelengthof the light and we won't get into thephysics of it now I'll soon do a postthat hopefully distills it in a mannerthat's simple enough that peopleunderstand but clearly some people seecertain colors in front of othersum and the person right next to themcould see the opposite color in frontand others say what are you talkingabout all the colors are in exactly thesame plane of of vision so that's theone that I know I'm guessing you knowsome others and perhaps some more robustones well I think you know perhapsthis is maybe not what you had in mindbut one way in which experience modifiesthe visual world has to do with how muchlight you're exposed to in the firstfive years or so of your life and sokids that don't get outside are muchmore likely to be myopicand it actually is excited nearsightedyes uh uh uh when they grow up uh thankids who got outside and we now knowthat at least part of the story is thatlight seems to stimulate theum uh expression of a class of moleculescalled trophic factors that you're wellacquainted with that actually change theshape of the eyeball so it's not reallythe structure of the retina or the lensof the cornea the actual degree ofelongation of the eyeball changeschanging the way the the retina sitsrelative to the lens and that seems tobe light dependent early in life and uhwhich gives rise to uh uh to a higherincidence of myopia and and to me thisis really well first of all it's it'sit's news you can use you should getyour kids outside for absolutely allkinds of reasons and you should getoutside too especially in the morningsyeah that circadian rhythm yeah I knowthat's a famous Huber menesque uh uh uhpoint they're gonna be putting me in thegrave David and I'm going to be tellingpeople to uh or it'll maybe it'll be onmy Tombstone he'll say get get sunlightin your eyes especially especially oncloudy days because there is stillsunlight even if you can't see thephysical object of the sun on cloudydayswell you know I think this whole idea ofhaving traits that are dependent uponearly life experience is fascinatingbecause there are a number of situationswhere you would guess that something isgeneticbut it isn't it's actually dependent onearly life experience and there's athere's an amazing story about thishaving to do with the early days ofWorld War IIso in the early days of World War II theJapanese Army just swept through Asiathey defeated the the British andMalaysia and Singapore they overrunThailand and Burma and they wereknocking on the gates of India andeverything was going great except theJapanese Army had a problem there werean enormous number of their soldiers whobecame incapacitated with heat strokethey got their core temperature got toohotand when the Army doctors uh examinethem they found this was much morelikely to happen in soldiers who camefrom the northern part of Japan Hokkaidowhere it's uh where it snows in thewinter as opposed to the southern partof Japan like Kyushu which is asemi-tropical environment and theclassical explanation the biologistslike us would guess would say oh allright well this has happened geneticallyover many years uh you have a familythat's been in Kyushu for manygenerations and you've selected fourGene variants that allow you to toleratethe heat better and we know actuallywhat this is so if you're more heattolerant it's because you have more of aparticular class of sweat gland calledthe ekrine sweat glands the sort of saltwater sweat glands not the Libertystinky armpit sweat glands called theapricorn ones the echron ones you have ahigher fraction of them that areinnervated meaning that the signals fromyour brain that say your core is too hotcan then make you sweat so the totaldensity of sweat glands between northernand southernsoldiers in Japan wasn't different butthe southern soldiers tend to have ahigher degree of innervation all rightso okay well this happened geneticallyover many generations but if you look atthose rare cases where you had soldiersfrom a long-established northern familyand their parents moved South and thenthey grew up in the southern locationthey had high sweat gland innervationthey were well tolerant conversely ifyou had a well-established SouthernKyushu family and they moved to Hokkaidoand then had their child that childdevelopedthe northern sweat gland innervationpattern so meaning less nerveinnervation of those sweat glands as youmentioned before just as many sweatglands just less nerve innervationtherefore those sweat glands could notbe activated they couldn't dump heat aswell their heat tolerance was lowerexactly right and and what's what'swhat's wonderful is that thisgives an advantage that you can't getthrough Evolution and that it can happenright away in this in in one generationright evolutionary change is slow rightand you can adapt as a species and as afamily over over many many manygenerations but when you have aphenomenon that is set by uh early lifeexperience well then you can benefitfrom that early life experience withinyour own life it's not that your greatgreat great great grandchildren willultimately benefit youbenefit another wonderful example ofthis uh comes from field mice voles andwe were talking earlier about how weboth worked with the scientist IrvZucker at uh at Berkeley who was aspecialist in uh in in involves and uhwhat people found is that if you take awild caught uh field mice and uh youhave uh pregnant mothers and you havethem in the lab but you manipulate thelights so that uh you have artificialspring in other words day length isgetting longer day after day during thepregnancy then what happens is whentheir pups were are born they will havea low density of fur anticipating summertemperaturesuh if you however uh put them inartificial fall where day length isgetting shorter uh they will be born nowwith high density of for anticipatingwinter temperatures and of course youcan do this no matter what the seasonactually is in the world by manipulatingthese lights in the lab and so like thesweating Japanese soldiers this is agreat example of early life plasticityand just the sort of trait that if youask someone they would probably guess isheritable but actually is notthanks for mentioning Irv Zucker who hasyou also mentioned was an advisor to usboth who's done incredible work incircadian biology seasonal rhythmshormones and behavior I have suchreverence for Irv and the experiment youmentioned made me smile wide becauseit's but one of gosh maybe hundreds ofincredible studies so if people areinterested in seasonal rhythms andcircadian rhythms andbiology of the most interesting kinddefinitely check out Irving zucker'swork at Berkeley we'll I'll provide alink to his uh PubMed uh there sincewe've been taking a tour of individual"

to be talking aboutheritability and human individuality andand so if I can go off on a little bitof a riff uh uh for the benefit of yourof your listeners and viewers here soif you look at human traits whetherthey're behavioral traits like shynessor very straightforward morphologicaltraits like heightuh what you tend to find is that thereare very few traits that are entirelyheritable where all their variabilitycan be predicted based on the genevariants you get from your mother andfather and there are a few traits thatare absolutely unheritable but that mostfall in between so let me give anexampleeveryone in the world has either wet ordry earwaxand it turns out that this is determinedby variation in the single Gene the nameof the gene is boring it's abcc11 uhit's a ion transporter and uh there's avariation in this Gene gives rise toeither web or dry earwax it doesn'tmatter how your parents raised you itdoesn't matter what foods you ategrowing up doesn't matter what what uhdiseases your mother had when you're onthe womb it's 100 percentheritable well does this mean thatabcc11 we should call it the earwax typeGene well no because it's not there justfor that like this this Gene isexpressed in cells in all parts of thebody doing all kinds of things earwax isjust something that we notice genesdon't code for traits they code forproteins and so we have to be carefulabout how we refer to them in that wayum for example the wet earwax G variantof the abcc 11 Gene also confers aslightly higher risk for breast canceruhso clearly it's not just for earwax it'sit's for a bunch of things most of whichwe don't yetknow about but in the case of earwaxthis trade is 100 heritableat the other end of the scale speechaccent is zero percent heritable it isentirely dependent upon the speech thatyou experience uh in your childhood andinterestingly it's the speech of yourpeers more than the speech of yourfamily which is why the children ofimmigrants sound like the place wherethey wound up not like their parentsand there is no evidence for any degreeof heritability not just to be clear I'mtalking about speech accent like whetheryou have a high or a low voice or it'snasal or more or less resonant these arephysical things having to do with thevocal tract and they are in partheritable Okay so we've got one thingthat's 100 heritable one thing is zeropercent heritable but where do mostThings Fall most Things fall in themiddleuh uh one of the most heritable traitsthat we know about in humans is heightand in the United States height is about85 percent heritable 85 percent of thevariation in the trade of height can beexplained uh by what you inherit fromyour mother and your fatherwell what's the rest well it's nutritionit's the diseases you fought off it'salso random variation which we'll talkabout a lot laterum now you might say okay well that's anestimate for people in the U.S is thistrue all over the world well noif you go to a place where peopleroutinelydon't get enough nutrition and areroutinely fighting off infectiousdiseases like this has been studied inrural Bolivia for example or rural Indianow height is no longer 85 percentheritable it's only 50 percent terriblewhy becausepeople inthese situations where they don't getenough nourishment where they'refighting off these diseases can't liveup to their genetic potentialfor heightif you want to make things better forthe people of the world then everyoneneeds to havebasic things like the ability to learnand enough nutrition and and decentMedical Care and schools in order tofulfill their genetic potential forpositivetraits and uh height I've used as anexample because it is veryuncontroversial but we could apply thevery same analysis to intelligencegeneral intelligence now there arepeople who argue about do things like IQtests really measure anything real andthere's been a lot of fighting in thescientific literature about this but Ithink intelligence tests aren't perfectand they are sometimes culture bound butthey are actually quite predictive of ofof of of later success and uh much moreso than say sat tests or GRE tests ormcats or other standardized testspresumably those correlate in some waythey do Baidu but but but the IQ testsare better actually they're talkingabout the the classic IQ test I amtalking about the modern variants of theclassic IQ tests that are administeredby trans psychologists uh and aren'tjust a paper form and so they're notperfect and no test will be perfect butthey're pretty good and so then if youask the question well what is theheritage ability for IQ test scorewell the answer tends to be differentdepending upon the population if youlook again in in countries like the usor in Western Europe that are fairlyaffluent where where people tend to havegood access to to nutrition and medicalcare and schooling and kids get to playand they're not and they're nottraumatized by War then uh then IQ testscore is heritable in the ballpark of60 70 percentbut if you look at people who don't havethose benefits who are poor and this canbe in the United States as well if youlook at uh communities that that uh facediscrimination and have consistentlypoor poor health care in schools then IQis less heritable why for the very samereason that it is in height becausepeople can't live up to their geneticpotential when they don't have the basicthings that everybody needsso presumably if two identical twins"

it that only 60 I think you saidabout 66 percent of their IQ can bepredicted on the basis of their geneticmakeup Aloneum I mean it makes perfect sense to meas to why if one of those twins went toschools that were demanding of you knowa lot of different topic matter and theother one went to schools where theinstruction level was really deficientthatone would perform far less well on an IQtest unless of course the IQ test isn'ttapping into school-based knowledge it'stapping into some otherum thermometer of of so-calledintelligence or IQ well you know thething is that good schoolscorrelate with many other things rightso the students that go to good schoolsaren't just benefiting from good schoolsthey tend to also have good medical careand safer less traumatizingneighborhoods and they're more likely tohave books parents with books in thehome and uh uh and and a whole number ofthings that are all beneficial so whenyou try to do epidemiology on this youhave to be aware that things are verydeeply interconnected but but you bringup a good point so it turns out that theway we get these estimates ofheritability there's two ways one way isto compareso-called identical or monozygotic twinswith so-called fraternal or dizygotictwins so the identical twins will sharenearly a hundred percent of their Genevariants and on average fraternal twinsshare 50 percent of their uh of theirGene variants and generally speakingwhen people do these studies in order toavoid confounds of sex they'll comparesame-sex fraternal twins so boys to boysand girls to girls uh uh and uh when youput these incidents into a formulacalled Fischer's equation then you cancome up with an estimate of theheritability of the trade but there isan assumptionpresence in that and it's called theequal environment assumption you'resaying well two kids raised in the samefamily have the same environmentswell that's not always true right thatcan be violated by a number of uh ofdifferent situations so it turns outthat a more powerful but much moredifficult way to estimate heritabilityis by looking at twins reared aparteither identical twins or fraternaltwins reared apart and there was alandmark study called the Minnesotastudy of twins reared apart which isabbreviated mystrathat is really the gold standard forassessing the heritability of manydifferent human traits both behavioraltraits but also disease incidents but ofcourse it's a small M because you knowthe population of identical twins rearedapart that you can get into the labisn'tisn't that large they had something Idon't remember the exact numbers butthey had something like 80 some uhidenticals and 50 some fraternals uh intheir in their sample but by doing thisthey were able to come up with a lot ofinteresting estimates and so for examplemost uh personality traits uh what thepsychologists uh use the acronym oceanto mean openness conscientiousnessempathy agreeableness and neuroticism Ithink I got that rightspelled right uh that these traits onaverage tend to be about 50 percentheritableand so okay you say right well fiftypercent of those personality traits isheritable the rest has got to be likehow you were raised it's got to be inyour family and so everyone was shockedwhen they actually did the analysisum and found that family has almostnothing to do with itiswhat what are are you kidding it's it'sit's it's it's it's got toand I think the important thing torealize is these traits I just listedyou know we call these personalitytraits but they are not the sum total ofthe way you are in the world parents caninculcate many things in their childrenthey can demonstrate trades so peopleare much more likely to go into anoccupation if their parents did they caninculcate moral ideas and religiousideas but in terms of these oceanpersonality traits they haveastonishingly little to do with it sothen this brings up the question well if50 of the variation in these personalitytraitsis not from your genetics and it's notfrom your family where does it come fromand the answer seems to be is that itcomes from the random nature of thedevelopment of the body and the nervoussystem and this is this is a point thatI think many people don't understandthis is something that biologists knowbut we've done a very poor job ofcommunicatingto the general public The genome allyour DNA all three billion bases of DNAall 19 000 or so genesin a human don't make a blueprintfor making your body and brain thereit's not a schematic diagram thatconnects everything to everythingparticularly in the nervous system wherewe have these hundreds of trillions ofconnections rather it's a rather vaguerecipeso the The genome doesn't say oh okayyou glutamate using neuron in the brainregion called the thalamus you know growfor 200 microns towards the top and thenand then and then cross the midline andthen grow towards the ear for you knowanother distance no it says somethinglike hey you bunch of glutamate neuronsin the thalamus over here in this areaabout half of you cross the midline andso what does this mean in terms ofindividual variation well it means wellfirst for for some individuals 40 oftheir axons will cross the midline ofthe brain and for anotherindividual 60 willin identical twins and as you correctlysaid a moment ago identical twins aren'treally identical either in their bodiesor their temperament so if you takenewborn identical twins and you givethem a CT scan just to measure the shapeof their organs they're not the same youmight have one twin whose spleen is 30larger than the than the other Twins orwhose liver is 30 smaller than the othertwins even though they have the exactsame DNA and they're relying right nextto each other in the womb and presumablyhave the same or very similarfetal environment and the reason is therandom or as we say stochastic nature ofneural development a great way to studythis is with nine banded armadillos Iknow we're getting weird here but I lovethe armadillo because I've been toldtell me I don't want to uh uh interruptyou too long but umas far as I know the only animal inNorth America that carries leprosy uhthat is that is true and um and there'sa lot of twinning going on in Armadillosright well what there is is actuallyquaddingso armadillos or the nine-boundedarmadillo in particular and they'redifferent armadillos I'm not really anarmadillo specialist I don't know ifthis holds for all of them but the ninebanded armadillo is born as identicalquadrupletsawesome awesome so you can take theseidentical quadruplet newly bornarmadillo I don't know you think youcall them pups I don't know what a babyarmadillo was called I'm sure there'ssome particular word for it and someonewill tell us I'm sure someone likecomments on YouTube what is the name ofa baby armadillo I know like a ferretbaby ferrets are kits uh the moms arejills the dads are bobs I used to beobsessed with this kind of naming it youknow it's a it's a business of ferretsor uh what is like a gang of raccoons orwhatever so if you can tell us what thename is for the baby armadillos as wellas what do you call a group ofarmadillosum you win the pride associated withbeing right that's right right one of myfavorites is on on ostentation ofpeacocks amazing or a murder of crowswho comes up with this stuff I know it'sa raft of otters I think that I thinkthat's correct but so if you have fournewborn uh identical nine foundedarmadillos then this is a great modelsystem that biologists can use to studyuh uh stochastic differences indevelopment and and sure enough theirbrands are wired slightly differentlytheir bodies are slightly different ifyou test them behaviorally even veryvery early in life they have differentpropensities some are bolder we'llExplore More some are will tend to hidein the corner more and you know we knowthis from the lab you get a box of micethat are inbred from the breeder and youpluck them out and they're notbehaviorally identical some might try tobite your hand some will run away somewill stand stuck still where does thisbehavioral variation come from in micethat are

variation is at the heartof individuality but there is also thereare also these other thingsright that we've talked about there'sthe effects of early life experience andthere is the stochastic nature ofdevelopment because if you through therandomness of development happen to havelike a particularly great liveryou're not going to pass that on to yourchildren right that isn't in yourgermline you won't pass that traitalong just a brief insert here ongermline we had ODed rashafi on thepodcast who studiesum epigenetic transmission and um and aninheritance of uh of of it's notlamarckian we have to point that out butum inheritance of of uh sort of acquiredtraits uh does happen and uh thegermline it's the genes that are presentin the the sperm and in the eggs all theother uh cells of your body have genesof course butum the best way to put this is uh simplygoing to the gym and getting fitum does not make your children more fitbecause the germline as far as we knowis not modified in a direct way uh inother words the DNA within sperm andeggs are not modified according to yourbehaviors in most but not all casesthat's right and and as you uh as youcorrectly said about oded's work andother people's work there is what'scalled transgenerational epigeneticinheritance which means that you canhave traits that are passed not from onegeneration to the next but even twogenerations to the grandchildren thatdon't require modification of DNA but todate that has been shown veryconvincingly in in wormsfound in plants uh the evidence inmammals is is really not there yet in inmy opinion and most of the claims forthat and it's a very popular thing tosay I epigenetically inherited mygrandmothers or great-grandmother'strauma uhthe evidence at Presence is is pooractually a lot of it comes fromepidemiology most of which came fromfamines in the other colics region ofNorthern Sweden and they had very goodmedical records and they said oh well ifyour grandfather went through the faminethen you're more likely to have thistrait if you're male or if yourgrandmother went through this then ifyou're if you're male this train you'refemale or that trait and I mean thereare two problems one is that there's nota biological mechanism but the otherproblem is that the way these thingswere discovered is by something calledharking orhypothesizing after the results areknown uh they did very many statisticalcomparisons to try to find somethingsignificant and you know from your workin the lab that when you do manycomparisons you're going to get somethings that look significant justoccasionally a randomly through throughluck and you have to apply a statisticalcorrection called a bonferoni correctionwhen you make many particularly post-hoccomparisons after the experiment uhcomparisons to set the bar much higherfor accepting that data and most ofthose studies they didn't apply thatcorrection and I remain unconvinced oftransgenerational epigenetic inheritancein mammals nowlet's be clearjust because it hasn't been shownconvincingly now it doesn't mean that itwon't be there are some good peopleworking very hard on this and they maywell uh describe a mechanism and showthis convincingly in the years to comebut right now uh you may well inherityour grandmas or great grandma's traumabut you're probably doing it sociallynot through marks on your DNA thatchanges how your genes are expressed ornot expressed yes so I subscribe to theidea that there is absolutely certainlytransgenerational inheritance ofparenting and upbringing right I meanyour grandparents raise your parents whoraise you not always people can beadopted in fact I have adopted membersof my familyum but I understand what you're sayingcorrectlythe evidence that for instance somestress-related Gene was modified duringa trauma in mygrandparents are great grandparentsand the idea that that was passed to methrough my parents that the evidencethere is is far weaker right and whenyou think about it well like how didthat happen that had to get into youryour grandparents sperm or egg cell andthen produce that effect in the brain ofyour parents and then it had to get intotheir sperm or Excel and then contributeto producing it in you but fragmentationof DNA and sperm is um or in eggs is isa is a commonum thing especially as people age DNAsperm and eggs fragmentum and it's possible that some of thosemutations still allow for viable embryosso it's in theory the germline could bechanged byum environmental events well right butnow I think you're starting to talkabout things that are heritableright you're not

uh for example we know that duringthe 1918 pandemic flew uh many womenwere pregnant and got the flu and if youlook at their children you findinteresting statistical anomalies andthose children for example the maleswound up going into the army for WorldWar II and of course the Army does acomplete physical and the records arevery good so you can go into thatdatabaseand you find that uh the male childrenuh that were uh in utero during thewinter of 1918 during the pandemic fluor on average a millimeter or twoshorter you might say a millimeter ortwo that's nothing but in a hugestatistical sample of millions of peoplethat's enormously significant moreinteresting is that the incidence ofschizophrenia went up about four foldfrom about one percent to about fourpercent and even though autism wasn't aterm in 1918 yet uh I think came alonglater what we now retrospectively wouldcall autism also went up by aboutfour-fold so there's something about mombeing stressedand carrying the fetus at a particularstage that seems to impact braindevelopment in a way that then makesthat child more likely to beschizophrenic or autistic when they growup do we know that it's stress and myrecollection of this I believe this wasum the late Paul sternberg's work aswell uh maybe have that nameum incorrect but in any event that it isif pregnant mom gets the fluin the first trimesteryou see this higher incidence ofschizophrenia and autistic Offspringum and but do we know that it's stressper se because it's stressful to havethe flu but the flu is a bunch of otherthings it could be fever could beum some breakdown in the immune barrierI just want to open up the the number ofvariables that this could be do or do weknow that it's something in thehypothalamic pituitary so-called stressaxis that is adrenals um so hypothalamicpituitary adrenal axisum like is it elevated cortisolum or could it literally be an immuneneural interaction of some other sortit's probably the last thing youmentioned an immune neural interactionand the reason I say that is that uhGloria Choi at MITuh uh together with her collaboratorshas made a mouse model of this phenomenaso she takes pregnant female mice andshe injects them with something thatthat it's she doesn't actually infectthem with virus she puts so chemicallimb that is on the code of viruses thatmimics viral infection and uh then whathappens is that in a way thatinterestingly is an interaction with thewith the bacterial content of her of herguts produces a surge of a immunesignaling molecule called interleukin17.interleukin 17 can pass through theplacenta into the fetus and if it'spresent just as you said at a particularpoint in development doesn't workanywhere during pregnancy but duringsomething that is sort of the mouseequivalent of the first trimesterif that occurs it causes disorderdevelopment of the layers of the cortexinstead of it looking like layers of acake you see balls and clumps of cellsand parenthetically in some but not allpostmortem tissue from autistic peopleyou can also see those balls and clumpsof cells are those balls and clumps ofcells thought to reflect umalterations in cell migrationthey are yeah some some I don't know ifit's entirely known how much of it isselled Vision or migration but certainlymigration is a part of it and it's verylikely that that critical moment uh todisrupt this ordering of the brain andproduce these increases in schizophreniaor or uh autism vulnerability uh arecoming at a point where neurons aremigrating uh during development and uhso what choice group did is they did allthe things we would want to do as abiologist so they gave things to blockthe function of of this interleukinsignaling molecule and it blocked thephenomenon they artificially injectedthe signaling molecule into fetal brainwhen the mom hadn't been stressed andthey could they could reproduce it soI'm not saying that there aren't effectsof stress hormones from the hypothalamicpituitary axis that are important thatyou mentioned but in this mouse modelsystem work it seems that you canproduce it through this immune signalingpathway and and so then the question iswell like are these mice autistic wellhow do you know if a mouse is autisticand the answer is it's actually a littlevague right there are behaviors thatneuroscientists say are analogous ofhuman autism and one of them is If YouGive a Mouse a marble in its home cageit will bury it over and over againcompulsively or bury many marbles andpeople say that that is somehowanalogous to some of the compulsivebehaviors you see an Autism it's a bitof a stretch right I mean it's achallenge to interpret mouse behaviordone in human terms butum it's a reasonable first stepcredible and uh I hope more willcontinue to be done as it surrounds theuh first trimester influenza hypothesisbecause it's been around a whileand um and obviously there's a spectrumof what we call autism Mass burgers andnowadays people refer to it as sometimesas neuroatypical there's some highfunctioning people with Autism there'ssome low functioning people with Autismand for that matter there's some highfunctioning and low-functioning peoplewho don't have autism soum but it is something that I think uhdemands our attention and and it thathopefully will be resolved at some pointbecause also influenza is uh but oneimmune uh insultum and presumably pregnant women arebeing bombarded with all sorts ofviruses and bacteria and fungalinfections and fighting them off we'renot fighting them off and who knows whatthe variation in uh neuro immuneinteractions exist in there that giverise to you knowgood variation and let's call it um youknow uh debilitating variation wellthat's that's absolutely right and sofor one example is that uh we don't knowwhat the effects are on the children whowere in utero while their mothers werefighting off covetright we won't know for uh for a whileor the common cold and there might

here's why I've been apracticing neuroscientist for you knowclose to three decades I know where thecerebellum is I've dissected a bunch ofthem Ium I could tell you where a few thingsare in there and I certainly have readabout what the cerebellum does butwhenever I do a PubMed search oncerebellum I see an ever expandingset of things that the cerebellum isimplicated in not just balance as mostpeople hear but also timing alsocognitionI hear about timing in particular ofmotor Behavior but then I also hear thatit's involved in learning and not justmotor learning and it certainly isinvolved in motor learningperhaps that little mini brain is uhdoing 50 or a thousand different thingsbuthow should we think about the cerebellumwhat is it doing and what are some ofits core operations that inform bothwhat it's doing and perhaps what otherareas of the brain are doing as wellbecause I can point to the retinas orthe auditory cortex or the thalamus andyes there's some mysterious nuclei inthe brain but to me the cerebellum isone of the most cryptic and complicatedstructures to understand and I know youspent some time in there sowhat's the cerebellum do well uhcerebellar researchers like to joke thatthe cerebellum is a counterweight tokeep your head from falling forward ohperfect well with all the textingnowadays people need bigger Ceramicsthat's right that's right probably overmany generations then that will happenalong with an expansion of the thumbs uhso uh but of course everybody's going totext with their minds in about another10 years right you'll have elong'simplants and you won't need your thumbsat all yeah or maybe just five or myfriend Eddie Chang is a neurosurgeon anduh works on the auditory system he'sbeen on this podcast before he wassaying that if in theory and actually inpractice you could just record theneural output to the muscles of thespeech system essentially and you couldjust amplify that and you could textwithout actually speakingum in fact when we read he told me uh weare actually receiving the signalsas if we were going to speak the wordswe're reading but they don't quitearrive at the place where you could geta full-blown post-synaptic potential soyou're not actually moving the vocalMachinery so that means the motorsignals are getting sent out there andso you're speaking what you are readingbutyou just don't know it that's right it'svery analogous to what happens duringthe REM phase of sleep right when youhave commands your brain is issuingcommands to your muscles to to do thingslike behave in your dreams to run awayor go here or go there uh but thosesignals actually are blocked and thebrainstem prevented from from reachingyour muscles because the uh nerves thatdon't go through your brain stem likethe ones that control your eye movementsaren't subject to that blockade that'swhy you can produce the rapid eyemovements in in REM sleep but yeah thisis a general theme in the brain a lot oftimes you have the output but then youshut it downand there are REM sleep behaviordisorders where people thrash and movein their sleep uh during during REM anduh it's because this outflow that'snormally blocked isn't isn't blockedhave you ever had the reverse happen uhI have where you wake up and you'restill in so-called rematonia you'restill paralyzed yes and there's thatSplit Second that feels like eternitywhere you are wide awake and you cannotmove and I'll tell you it's terrifyingyeah a sleep paralysis and actually youknow it's been known uh forever you canactually find ancient Greek depictionsof people lying with a demon on theirchest paralyzing them and that isactually from sleep paralysis laterHogarth uh did a drawing uh of exactlythat uh so yeah this is a well-knownphenomenon but to get back to thecerebellum uh as we startedum sothe cerebellum isas you said definitely involved in motorcoordination so people who have damageto the cerebellum aren't paralyzed butthey tend to be clumsy uh they tend tonot coordinate their movements they havea disturbed gate if they're reaching foran object they often overshoot it andhave to make successive approximatingmotions to get back uh to their targetso that's well understood but if youlook through Evolution the cerebellum isconnected to this brain region calledthe thalamus and it's connected fromthere to many regions includingthe frontal cortex where phenomena likeuh like planning and uh decision makingand uh moral sense and many aspects ofPersonality seem to be encoded so thenthe question becomes well that's veryfar away from being clumsy what arethese connections doing and as time hasgone on I've been in this business fromover 40 years now I'm an old guy and soinitially we said oh yeah cerebellummovement control motor coordinationthat's what it's foras time goes on as you correctly saidthe cerebellum has been implicated inmore and more functions many of whichare far removed from the motor systemand if we're looking for a theme aboutwhat the cerebellum does is that it istheretopredict the immediate futureit's trying to determine what's going tohappen in the next second or two to bestGod behavior and as you can imagine thiskind of General computation could beapplied very well you can see why it'simportant for you know motor systems anddoing sports and you know if you'retrying to hit a baseball and looking atwhat the pitcher is doing and trying toanticipate what the pitch is but it alsocomes up in a social realm if we'retrying to read someone and predict whatthey are going to do is this personFriend or Foe which is one of the firstthings that we try to assess whenmeeting someone are they competent whichis the second thing we try to assess uhwhen meeting something a lot of thisdepends upon predictive circuitry and uhit depends in part on the cerebellum andit seems to be at least partiallyimpaired in people who sustaincerebellar damage so it seems as ifinterestinglythe cerebellum started out

            "text": "relevant butnever so much as when thinking about thenervous systemand I know this firsthand because I'vestudied neural development both thenature side the so-called hardwiredstuff that genes just set upneurons wire up to that neuron Etc thecerebellum's in the back the eyes are inthe front the hard-wired stuff and thenthe soft wired stuff the nurture stuffis the stuff that can be modified byexperiencewhat are your thoughts on nature versusnurture and should there even be aversus in thereyeah I don't think there should and andI have a lot of problems with natureversus nurture as uh as an expression itwas popularized by Francis Galton uh inthe 19th century a colleague of uh of uhof Darwin's and I think it's wrong in ormisleadingin a lot of ways so of course the naturein nature versus nurture is meant inthis case to me inheritability rightwhat you inherit in the gene variationsfrom your mother and fatherand nurture means like how your parentsor your community raised youuh the problem I have with nurture isthat it is too narrow a termthat really it should be replaced withthe word experience and experience inthe broadest possible sense not justsocial experience but uh the foods yourmother ate when she was carrying you inuteroum the diseases you fought off or yourmother fought off while she was carryingyou uh in utero the bacterial populationof your guts uh so experience meaninganything that impinges on you startingfrom the earliest stages of fetaldevelopments uh continuing to the lastday of your life I think it should bevery expansive much much more thansocial experience in the family or theor the community and as you mentioned Ihave a problem with a versus becausethere's this idea that these things areare essentially in opposition well is hethat way because of of of his Genevariants or is that way because of whatwhat happened to him and I think thething to realize is that uh experienceand heredity interact in all kinds ofinteresting ways some of which areoppositional and some of which arereinforcing a classic one from geneticshas to do with a genetic disease calledphenylketonuria or PKU which is aninability to uh to metabolize uh thedietary amino acid phenylalanine and uhso uh in order to have this you have toinherit broken copies of this Gene fromboth your mother and your father so it'sa so-called recessive trait andhere's where the experience comes in itonly matters if you eat foods rich inthe phenylalanine if you don't itdoesn't matter that you inherited thesethings right so that's a way in whichgenes and experience interact an idea ofin ways in which then they interactpositivelyum think aboutathletic ability right so a lot ofathletic ability is has a heritablecomponent if you are born fast forexample uh then you're more likely to doSports and practice them and get betterexports as a result of your experienceso here genes and experience are feedingback on each other in a positivefeedback loop so there really isn't aversus a versus at all and then ofcourse the last thing is that this isn'tthe entirety so we talked earlier aboutthe pseudo-random nature of developmentstochastic development and so if I wereto take the phrase nature versus nurtureand reconfigure it I would change it toreadheritability interacting with experiencefiltered through the random nature ofdevelopment now that doesn't fall offthe tongue as elegantly as nature versusnurture you know nature versus nurtureis like if the govs the gloves don't fityou must quit you know it's got thatkind of Snappy snare drum beats but Ithink it's it's a more accurateso heritabilityinteracting with experience filteredthrough the randomness of developmentyeah so we can shorten that up and umand we'll just call it um uh the Lindenhypothesis you know I I don't think Ican take credit for that it belongs toother people sure but um but there's along history in science of of thingsbeing shortened up and uh coined andthat's uh as important and I'm not we'renot trying to rob attribution hereum uh and the good news isperhaps you can't call it the Lindenhypothesis but I can all right and whatI've found is as with the Galpinequation which is now out there as ahydration it's a formula a formula thatgives broad butum research informed parameters as tohow much water one should drink in orderto maintain proper hydration forphysiologists Dr Andy Galpin who's a PhDin uh physiology and an expert in allaspects of exercise science there's theGalpin equation there's the sobergprinciple so I'm naming these thingsleft and right all right um whereappropriate and umso I'm naming these things uh sparinglyand where appropriateum so from here on out heritabilityinteracting with experience filteredthrough the randomness of development isthe Linden hypothesis and I'll be damnedif anyone's going to rename it uhum faster than I'm going to propagate itall right well I think all the thegeneticists will be gnashing their teethabout this being named after someone whoisn't actually a geneticist quite allright and their dentists will thank melet's talk about Mind Body okayI'm fascinated by this"

            "text": "um for a couple of reasons and I promiseto keep this brief but when I wasgrowing up I was very interested inanimals and biology and my father's ascientist and I got very interested inNeuroscience earlyum as people perhaps know and so much ofNeuroscience as I was coming up throughthe mid 90s 2000s 2010 to 20 stretch wasfocused on the brain piece very littleon the body there was nothing about gutbrain access in the early discussionsand courseworkum in parallels all of that I've beeninterested in mental health physicalhealth and let's just call itperformance and um got interested inmeditation respiration based practicesthings like Yoga Nidra things that byway of experience I understoodimmediately had a profound influence onthe nervous system states of Mind andBody nowadays there's an entireInstitute at the National Institutes ofHealthfor complementary health and Medicineessentially exploring things like YogaNidra respiration practices evensupplements and things of that sort andthere's this understanding that oh mygoodnessthe nervous system extends into the bodyand the body sends neural signals backinto the brain and so this whole notionof Mind Body has fortunately migratedaway from kind of umCalifornia Counter Culture esselenInstitute only uh you knowum hippie New Age Magic Carpet stuffby the way that's not what I believethat's but that's often how it waslooked at in the past and now people atevery level of science and medicine atevery major universityand in every scientific journal arestarting to publish papers about theinteractions between bodily organs likethe breathing apparati thediaphragm lungs the heart heart ratevariability we hear about the liver thegut brain axis in particular and so MindBody the idea that our thoughts couldinfluence our body and that our bodilyState could influence our thoughts isfortunately not justunderstood but it seems to be bothaccepted and appreciatedso what are your thoughts on Mind Bodywhat does that mean to you andwhat do you think is the potential ofthe mind-body interaction it seems to mewe've just barely scratched the surfaceyeah well I'm glad you asked because Ithink it's a it's a really fascinatinguh situation and uh where things arechanging very very quickly and I thinkto me the most important thing forpeople to understandis that when you have a hypothesis let'ssay you have a hypothesis that uhmeditationcanattenuate chronic pain all rightwell there is a temptation to think thatthis operates outside the realm ofScience and biology that is in some Airyfairy realm in the clouds that thishappens and and and I mean for for goodreason there are a lot of people whowill describe it in exactly that waywith auras or they they clop scientificterms like resonance and energy but theydon't actually use them in scientificways so you know there's a lot of veryfuzzy language that surrounds this butit shouldn't obscure the facts that whenyou have a hypothesis that say somemental state like meditation or orguided breathing uh uh affects someprocess in the body thatyou should be trying to understand thisin terms of a biological hypothesis notin terms of some some someindistinct realm that that is that isdifferent like manifestation yeah andyou know I really learned this initiallyfrom my father my father was apsychiatrist in fact kind of a talkingcure old-fashionedpsychoanalyst how does practice in uhLos Angeles and uh we would have dinnertogether every Wednesday nights and uhhe would always tell me about hispatience he was very careful to keepconfidentiality right he wouldn'tbreak confidentiality but you know Iwould say oh this how's your narcissistoh we had this dream you know so thiswas you know this was this was normalconversation when I was 14 15 years oldwith my dad and one day I said Dad it'sreally clear to me that through thistalking cure a large fraction of yourpatients feel better and they conquertheir depression or or their obsessivethoughts or things that are blockingthem how do you think it worksand he says well we don't really knowthe mechanics But ultimately when itworks it's not working in some areafarrier realm it is working by changingthe biology of the brainand when he said that it was like alightning bolt went off in my headand I thought wellI don't have the kind of personality tobe a talking cure psychiatrist I'm notnearly nice enoughbutI could understand the underlyingbiology maybe I'll do thatand soas you've correctly pointed out when yousay the phrase Mind Body you're talkingabout two directions you're talkingabout mental functions affecting thebody and then you are also talking abouthow phenomena in the body affects affectthe mind and we're understanding so muchmore about how that happens and I thinkthe general thing for your yourlisteners to appreciate is that we havesome culpritshere right and generally speaking thereare there are two classes of culprits soif you want to get signals about thebody to the mind there's two ways to dothat one of them is through neurons thatreach out into the body and sense thingsand this is referred to as introceptionright so as opposed to extra receptionyour outward pointing senses these arethe senses that monitor your own bodyand and while we can consciously beaware of a lot of that information a lotof it is happening subconsciously likeyour breathing is happeningautomatically most of the time withoutyou thinking about it and that dependsupon sensors about your blood chemistryand the state of your lungs and a numberof other things that are regulating thatprocess and it's all happening in thebrain usually below the level of yourconscious attention in addition to theneural signals there is also a wholerealm of hormonal or diffusible immunesignals and what these are is that theseare chemicals that are released into thebloodstream and that move throughout thebody and that can uh activate neurons inthe brain or in other parts of thenervous system to produce changes in uhin mental in mental function and I thinkthe real thing that is exciting a lot ofpeople right now has to do with immunesignaling molecules so there's a classof molecules called cytokines andcytokines are basically the signalinghormones of the immune system and theythey can flow through the bloodstreamand through lymphatic fluid and reachmany parts of the body uh we've knownfor a number of years that thespecialized receptors for thesecytokines are found throughout the brainand yet we know very very very littleaboutwhat they do and that's going to be anastonishinglyfruitful area of scientific research butbut to give one one Exemplar"

            "text": "on one candidate hypothesis that I'vebeen thinking about I've covereddepression on a few episodes and um I'vehad a Robin cardard Harris from UCSF andDr Matthew Johnson from your very ownJohn Hopkins University both of whomwork run Laboratories studyingpsychedelics for the treatment ofdepressionthe clinical trials on psilocybin and tobe clear so Simon's still illegal it'sbeen decriminalized a few places butwe're not talking about recreational usewe're talking about several therapysessions and then two without psilocybinthen two 2.5 gram approximately dosagesof psilocybin given separately againwith therapists present and thenfollow-up therapy sessions seem to leadto relief of depression in approximatelysomewhere between 65 and 80 percent ofpeople in some cases total remission insome cases some relief without remissionokay so we can kind of set that resulton the Shelf it's been repeated a numberof different timescompare that to the results of ssriswhich seem to help a third of people athird minimally and a third not at alland of course there's the side effectprofiles of the ssris and Associateddrugs not just the ssris but proprionand the other antidepressants that aretaken in prescription drug form and thenthere's this uh inflammation piece socould we hypothesize that relief fromdepression has something to do withneuroplasticity rewiring of neuralcircuits and that psilocybin we know canencourage neuroplasticityand that perhapsssris can encourage neuroplasticity insome peoplenot all and that inflammation is abarrier to neuroplasticityto me this is the only thing that canreconcile the the current status of theof the results and then there'sketamine-based therapies and so we haveto also kind of set that on the Shelfbut let's set that aside on the shelffor now to keep it simpleum it seems to me that based on the timecourse over which ssris work the factthat they increase serotonin uh veryquickly but the relief from depressioncomes much later the fact thatneuromodulators like serotonin areintimately involved in neuroplasticitythey can in some cases gaitneuroplasticity that are all centersback to changing neural circuits and sowhat we're really trying to do whetheror not it's transcranial magneticstimulation or now we can throw ketaminein there or psilocybin or ssristhat treating depression is aboutrewiring the brain it's not aboutchemical A or B per se althoughserotonin seems involvedto me what I'd love to see is are morestudies about the interaction betweenneuroplasticity and inflammation and arewe seeing that kind of work out thereand um because these results sort of sitas disparate somewhat conflicting but itseems like inflammation is isanti-neuroplasticity and broadlyspeaking here I realize there are manyinterleukins there are many you knowsome of which are inflammatory some arewhich are anti-inflammatory but is thatis that a meaningful hypothesis and itum can do you think there's any hopewhatsoever to actually cure depressionif we if we sort of start to uh unifythe the results in these different campsyeah I think it's a completelyreasonable hypothesis and I would bebroader and I would say honestly therelief of any Neuropsychiatric conditionultimately is from neuroplasticity insome form or another and I think it'sworthwhile to step back a bit and talkabout what neuroplasticity means uh todate there has beena focus on synapses on the contextbetween neurons as the site ofneuroplasticity and that's warrantedsynapses are plastic they change as aresult of experience as a result ofhormone changes as a result of exerciseas a result of lots of things butsynapses are not the be-all and end-allof neural function so for exampleneurons work by sending electricalsignals uh uh along their lengths andand between neurons and interconvertingthose with chemical signals and theprocesses of generating those electricalsignals the ion channels that areinvolved that are embedded in membranesthat are involved in that are alsoplastic they can also change as a resultof experience that's what we callintrinsic plasticity as opposed tosynaptic plasticity in addition thereare literal morphological changes sowhen we we talk about the wiring of thebrainsometimes we're talking about literalwiring like cell a wasn't connected tocell b and now it is and that changesand then sometimes well actually cell awas connected to cell b but cell bwasn't responsive enough and now there'sa change in cell b so now cell a canfire cell b and that could have been aresult of a change in its synapse makingit more receptive to another transmitterrelease from cell a or it could besomething intrinsic and cell a thatmakes it fire its electrical signal itsSpike more easily I think that one ofthe key cell types that's going to beimportant for your hypothesisum linking inflammation to synapticplasticity is going to be a cell calleda microglial cell and microglial cellsare non-neuronal cells in the brain thatare motile they can crawl around theyhave long processes and they can gobblethings up they can literally sort ofchew away and digest bits of theextracellular scaffolding that surroundsneurons and synapses and thereby rendersthem plastic they can uh destroysynapses and there is a lot ofindication that certain disease Statesmay involve over exuberant microgliapruning synapses to a degree that theyshouldn't and we know that microglia arechock-full of cytokine receptors and soare responsive to inflammatory signalswhen we're talking about inflammationand we're talking about drugs it'sworthwhile to mention that there are alot of Behavioral things that also caninfluence the signaling so we know and Iknow you've discussed on your programthe incredibly salubrious effects ofphysical exercise on mental function soexercise is about as good anantidepressant as ssris are and the sideeffects are only good side effects asopposed to the bad side effects of ssrisand again this isn't working throughsome Airy farrier realm the reason thatExercise Works to relieve depression andthe reason that Exercise Works tomaintain your cognitive function as youage is because of biological Pathwaysthat we are now uncovering some of whichwill involve microgl cells and neuronsand other types of cells in the brainssome of which will involve not theneurons in the brain at all but thebrain's vasculature so we know thatexercise is very salubrious for keepingblood flowing to the brain and whenyou're young you have a super abundanceof blood flow into your brain so itdoesn't matter if it's reducedtransiently you're fine but as you getolder ah your blood vessels become moreoccluded and less elastic and you'recloser to the to the to the trouble spotand if you exercise regularly you candilate and make your blood vesselsincluding those in your brain moreelastic and that is almost certainlyprotective against both depression andcognitive decline uh as we agewell I am a fan of exercise but I'mfortunate that I enjoy running andsome forms of resistance trainingumso I always assume that the good sideeffects were just the positive moodeffects until the recent literature thatas you mentioned uh improved vascularvasculature blood flow and reducedinflammation if not during the exercisewhen inflammation actually increasesdecreases inflammation I'm delighted tohear you say the word microglia and um"

hypnosisthere's um uh touch-based Body Mindcommunicationif we're going to talk about Mind Bodyalso we should refer to as body mindum how do we dive in and think aboutthis because this is involving clearly athousand different neural Pathways notjust the vagus nerve it's you knowtypically people just kind of hang theirhat on Mind Body must be vagus nerve andof course it involves the vagus but theVegas is an extensive set of Pathways soum how do you like to frame up mind bodyand what's most intriguing to you aboutmind-body communication both in terms ofthe biology and its practicalapplications well I think just as wetalked about how there are two potentialPathways in conveying signals from thebody to the mind there are also twopotential Pathways at least twopotential Pathways it's a conveyingsignals from the brain to the body andthey are the the the neural signals thatare conveyed by neurons that actuallyget there and they are hormones andneurotransmitters and cytokines that arereleased from the brand I should mentionthat that hormones are actually producedby neurons including for example some ofthe hormones that you think about asbeing produced as sex hormones likeestrogen is produced by neurons in yourbrain for exampleum soLet me Give an example that I think is abit out there but I think is reallyreally fascinatingand this comes from uh from the cancerworldand so uh melanoma is a is a is a badcancer it kills a lot of people it canspread it's uh highly metastatic and weknow that melanomas often becomeinnervated that is to say they becomecontacted by neurons and wrapped andreceived signals from them and we alsoknow that if a melanoma becomesinnervative thenthe prognosis for that patient is worseit's more likely to grow it's morelikely to spreadwell how does that happen well recentlyuh there have been some reports that uhshow that neurons that innervate themelanoma don't act directlyonto the tumor cells rather what they dois they secrete a signaling moleculethat has a receptor on immune cells thatare patrolling the edges of the melanomatumor and nibbling away atoms and theywhen that signaling molecule is releasedfrom the neuronituh shuts down or reduces that immunepatrolling function and then as aconsequence the tumorcan grow and spread and butt off morereadily so this signal that comes fromneurons is sending the ambulances homeso to speak yeah exactly and the signalis something called calcitonin Generelated peptide or CGRP uh I'm familiar with cgrp from thedomain of touch and its involvement inum I think like itch perceptionperception and its perception right yeahand so all right so ifneurons canumcan affect the progression of cancerthrough their activity and these neuronsin the periphery are ultimatelyconnected to the brainthrough a couple of different hopsum themis it reasonable to hypothesize thatmental processes could affect cancerprogression so let's say we have ahypothesis and it's a wild hypothesisand I want to just emphasize that thereis not evidence for this but let's makethe hypothesis that says that throughmeditative practice you canslow the progression ofcertain tumors that tend to getinnervatedrightwell right now this is just kind of awild idea but I think the importantthing as I've said before that this is awild idea with the biological substrateit's not like you meditate and Magichappens and force fields open and theAngels Singand then your tumor shrinks this is weare saying that activity in certainareas of the brain is increased by thismeditative practice and that this sendssignals to this neuron and this neuronthat actually go to the tumor and makesomething happen through thisbiochemical pathway that we have definedright and to me this is speculative butit's also extraordinarilyexciting right it opens akind of Investigation ofmind to body signaling that has receivedverylittle attention up to nowincredible and I say incredible becausewhile you're giving an example of cgrpand nerve innervation and metastatictumorsI absolutely love the idea thatphenomenon involving some practice thatcould be put under the umbrella of MindBody or Body Mindbecomes something entirely differentwhen we're trying tohang that on the hook of a biologicalprocess it's like somethingfundamentally changes there rightum you know it's amazing to mefor instance that early on psychedelicsand breath work conscious breath workwere lumped together cost people theirjobs at major universities I won't namethe universities because we're all youwork at one I work at another andthere's a third one um called Harvard Iguess I just named themum but nowadays their Laboratories atevery single one of those institutionsstudying deliberate respiration onhealth as well as psychedelics andmeditation for that matter with the goalof understanding what cytokines whatneurotransmittersEtc change through defined Pathwaysincluding vagus but phrenic nerves andfrontal cortex and

sooner or lateryesum if you're willing could you tell usthe story of how that diagnosis came tobewhat your initial reaction was and wherethings stand now and and perhaps we canexplore some of the well let's just saypleasant surprises that have emergedsince that initial diagnosis well sureI'd be happy to uh so in the uh thesummer of 2020 uh in the dark days ofcovid when things were looking reallybad I developed profound shortness ofbreath I couldn't get up a flight ofstairs without uhuh without huffing and puffing and Ithought oh well I've got covet but Itook covert tests and there was theythey were all negative but I thought ohI must have covet I've got the symptomsof kovid I have respiratory issues I'mfeeling weak it's got to be covered andafter a while when this didn't go awaymy wife said like you got to go into thedoctor this is crazy it's you got tofind out what's going on and I did andthey uh they hooked me up to anelectrocardiogram and they said oh uhyou've got atrial fibrillation meaningthat your heart is doing two beats everytime it should do one so I have a veryhigh heart rate and when the heart beatsthat fast it can't work very effectivelythere's enough time to recharge beforethe next beat comes now it turns outthat there is a very straightforwardtherapy for this uh atrial fibrillationcomes from uh electrical signaling inthe heart sort of swirling about in acircle and and reactivating part of aheart muscle faster than it should andso if you thread through a catheter inyour in your in your in your groin up uhup through blood vessels you can put ina little needle and use that tocauterize and to ablate a tiny littlestrip of cells in the heart that willproduce a barrier that will prevent thataberrance return of electrical activityand will cure atrial fibrillation so Ihave that process that ablation surgeryand sure enough it it cured my atrialfibrillation and I was feeling terrificand they said oh as a follow-up comeback a few months later and we'll do anechocardiogram to see how your heartlooksand they did and they went oh my Godthere's this huge mass pressing againstyour heartit's like the size of a Coke canuh here's what we think it is we thinkit's a hiatal hernia we think yourstomach has poked up through thediaphragm muscle and it's nestling nextto your heart so the way we diagnosethis it's kind of humorous they say chugthis can of Dr Pepperand then quickly get up on the table andwe'll do the echocardiogram and in theechocardiogram we can see a signature ofthe popping CO2 bubbles in your soda andif we see those in the mass then we knowit's your stomach so I did it I chunkedit I got up there oh no it's not yourstomachI said oh okay well what we think thisisa Teratoma and a Teratoma is adevelopmental uh anomaly that you carryusually from fetal life where there's agroup of different cells that gets in aplace where it shouldn't duringdevelopment and then grows you'veprobably heard about people whosometimes get like a a tooth that growshair in their abdomen Sometimes womenhave these around their ovaries andthey're not malignant they don't spreadit's a fairly easy thing but I have thisenormous Coke can pressing on my heartit may have we don't know have been thesource of my atrial fibrillation tostart with but in order to deal withthis I had to have open heart surgery soI had the surgery and it was a big hairydeal I was told would last about fivehours it turns out it lasted two dayswowum they had me on the heart lung bypassmachine longer than you're supposed tobecause you're very likely to throw aclot and get a stroke fortunately thatdidn't happen I I had very skilledsurgeons at Johns Hopkins it wasbleeding so much that they couldn'tclose the chest so they had to do allthe surgery and then just leave meanesthetized with my chest open untilthe bleeding stopped and they go so thesurgery was a bearand then I'm waiting to get thepathology report back on the tissue theyremoved and it came back and it was badnews sorry it's not a Teratoma it's notbenign it is a kind of cancer calledsynovial sarcoma and synovial sarcoma isa moderately rare cancer and it usuallyaffects the synovium which is the liningof the joints or some other places it'spretty rare to have it happen in theheart there are a few examples if youlook in the biomedical literature forcommon cancers like testicular cancer orbreast cancer there are huge tables ofstatistics for millions of patients onwhat's been tried and what works andwhat the prognosis is for synovialsarcoma of the heart their onlyindividual case reports oh there's a guyin Kenya and he got in this whathappened there's there's a woman inMinnesota and this is what happened withher right there are no statisticsbecause because it's that rare and andand the oncologist out wellI think you've got 6 to 18 months tolivenow this was aboutuh now 27 months ago so I've fortunatelyuh exceeded that lifespan estimate and Ithink we got to be clear also that youknow being an oncologist has got to be aterrible job for many reasons but one ofthem is that you got to give a lifespanestimate even if you really don't havethe data to do it in a very importantyou can't just say I won't do it rightyou got to do it people expect it so youknow I'm not saying like oh theoncologist was incompetent because I'veoutlived my estimate you know he wastrying to do something based on verylittle information made his best guessso umsoyou know I got this information and I"

    "episode_summary": "In this episode, my guest is Dr. David Linden, Ph.D., professor of neuroscience at Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine and the author of many popular books about the brain. We discuss individual differences between people \u2014 focusing on differences in how people sense the world around them and the roles that chance, heredity, and life experiences (even in utero) play in determining our physical and cognitive traits. We discuss the bidirectional connection between the mind and body and how our thoughts and mental practices (e.g., meditation and breathwork) impact our health. We also discuss the link between inflammation and depression. We also discuss Dr. Linden\u2019s terminal illness diagnosis, his mindset during chemotherapy and what his diagnosis has taught him about the mind, gratitude, time perception and life. This episode also covers sensual touch, cerebellar function, and epigenetic inheritance and ought to be of interest to all interested in neuroscience, genetics, psychology and human development.\u00a0\nFor the full show notes, including articles, books, and other resources, visit hubermanlab.com.\nTake our survey and get 2 months of Huberman Lab Premium\nThank you to our sponsors\nAG1: https://drinkag1.com/huberman\nROKA: https://roka.com/huberman\nLevels: https://levels.link/huberman\nInsideTracker: https://insidetracker.com/huberman\nSupplements from Momentous\nhttps://www.livemomentous.com/huberman"
