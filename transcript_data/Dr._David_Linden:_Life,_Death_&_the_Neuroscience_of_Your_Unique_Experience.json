            "text": "welcome to the huberman Lab podcast where we discuss science and science-based tools for everyday life I'm Andrew huberman and I'm a professor of neurobiology and Ophthalmology at Stanford school of medicine today my guest is Dr David Linden Dr David Linden is a professor of neuroscience at Johns Hopkins school of medicine his laboratory has studied neuroplasticity that is how Connections in the Brain Change in response to experience much of that work focused on a structure called the cerebellum which is also sometimes referred to as the mini brain because it looks like a mini brain in the bottom and back of the human brain and it's responsible for an enormous number of basic functions that we use in everyday life including our motor behavior that is our ability to walk and talk but also dance play instruments and it's responsible for an enormous number of basic functions that we use in everyday life including our sense of balance our ability to learn new motor behaviors as well as our sense of timing today we will discuss the cerebellum and what it does but Dr David Linden will also teach us about the important sense of touch as well as what makes us different as visuals the reason today's discussion encompasses so many important topics is that Dr David Linden's laboratory has focused on many of those topics and he is also the author of five excellent popular books about Neuroscience that focus on for instance our sense of pleasure and where it originates from and what controls it in the brain as well as our sense of touch and today we start off our discussion by talking about the recent discovery of a set of neurons that have been known about for a long period of time but that only recently have been characterized that are involved in sensual touch in particular and it's a fascinating conversation I assure you in addition to that Dr David Linden informs us about what makes us individuals how each and every one of us perceives the same things differently and it's an absolutely fascinating conversation which tells you for instance why some of you think a smell is putrid indeed smells like vomit whereas others perhaps are not bothered by that smell and why others still are attracted to that smell or something that you look at or something that you hear we also talk about nature versus nurture and how we come to be who we are not just through our genes and epigenetics but also through our early childhood experience and adult experience and then in the latter third of our conversation we shift to talking about the so-called mind-body connection and the science underlying how our thoughts inform our bodily health or lack thereof as well as how the organs of our body control the chemicals hormones and thoughts within our brain then we shift to discussing Dr David Linden himself and the fact that in 2020 he was diagnosed with a form of heart cancer that led his Physicians to tell him that he had six to 12 months to live now obviously because he was in our studio to record this conversation he has outlived that prognosis but he lives day to day with the knowledge that his death may very well come soon although it isn't clear exactly when that day will come of course he tells us how the initial prognosis of his cancer as well as outliving that prognosis has informed his day-to-day life as well as his thinking and his relationships and that leads to a very direct and frankly emotional conversation that includes advice on how all of us can get the most out of our daily living and out of our overall life it's an extremely powerful conversation that I believe everyone regardless of age or health status can benefit from and it's one that makes clear that not only is Dr David Linden a spectacular scientist but also a spectacular educator a spectacular popular writer a spectacular Family Man including husband and father and friend to many people and his colleagues but he is also a courageous and spectacularly generous human being before we begin I'd like to emphasize that this podcast is "

            "text": "been looking forward to our conversation and we have a lot to talk about we do lots of different aspects of science lots of different aspects of personal journey and what you're confronting now as it relates to your health and your future I want to start off with a question that I learned from the one and only the great Carl dyseroth who was the first guest on this podcast my colleague at Stanford and for those of you that don't recognize Carl's name he is a absolute Phenom he's a active clinical psychiatrist so he's an MD and he also is a bioengineer who's developed a lot of the modern tools for probing the brain and um anytime I've met with Carl the first thing he says is what are you most excited about lately that's a good question it is uh so I'm gonna steal that approach and say what are you most excited about lately well very very lately the most interesting thing that I read in Neuroscience is the answer to a a scientific problem that I think is really dear to a lot of people's hearts and that is what are the nerve endings in the genitals that are responsible for sexual sensation and you know if you think about it right people can feel sexy from being touched on lots of different parts of the body but there's something special about the genitals doesn't matter male or female or intersex or gay or straight or bi or whatever you are you know the genitals are are a hot spot and why and you you'd think as biologists we'd know this by now this would be something we could just answer but but it's been a mystery for a long time and if you go back to to 1860 there was a German neuroanatomist named Krauss and he cut thin sections of tissue from the penis and the clitoris and he looked at them under the microscope and he saw a particular kind of nerve ending there that has since been called the Kraus corpuscle and there were lots of them in these two places and so he thought well maybe this is the cellular basis of sexual sensation maybe these are the particular nerve endings that are responsible uh for this um but there were some things that that were in favor of that and some not so these nerve endings are also in some other places that people can find more or less sexy like they're in the nipples and they're on the lips and they're in the anus all places that get popular in uh in that domain but they're also in places like the cornea or the lining of the joints so distribution doesn't quite make sense uh and so it was never known and so if you wanted to really test as a scientist whether these nerve endings are responsible you want to record their electrical signals while the genitals are being touched you'd want to inactivate these cells and see if you could interfere with with uh sexual sensation and this in a pre-print from David ginty's group at Harvard is just what they have been able to do in mice they found a way to label and record from and activate and inactivate artificially uh The Krauss corpuscles and so you see a nerve ending in the skin it could be convey angle kinds of information it could be tuned for hot or for cold or for itch or for pain or for in or for inflammation or for mechanical Sensations stretching vibration indentation and sure enough when they recorded from these Kraus corpuscles they really are mechanical sensors as you would expect uh if they were involved in sexual sensation so that was good and then uh the other thing then that they did is they they tried to artificially turn them on and so the way they did that is they used genetic tricks to express one of Carl diceroth's uh uh molecules that activates neurons when they're when blue light is shown on them and they found that if they express uh uh this artificial protein in the cross cells in a in a male Mouse and then shine blue light the mouse gets an erection all right so far so good what happens if you turn them off well if you turn them off in a male Mouse it's just as interested in females when they're in heat but it won't mount and thrust and ejaculate as much and if you turn them off in a female Mouse during the time of her cycle where she would normally be sexually receptive uh you find that she is much less interested she's much less likely to let him out she's much less likely to let him finish so this is the remarkable results that uh finally after all these years since 1860 now we know what the nerve endings are that convey sexual sensation and like all good science then you know there are a lot of questions that are really interesting to our everyday lives like you know people like different things in bed and have different propensity for orgasm or or like like to be touched in different ways well is part of that reason because of individual variation in their Krauss corpuscle structure we know that sexual sensation diminishes with aging is that in part because Kraus corpuscle density is lost from the skin of the genitals and that's a reasonable idea because we know for example that fine touch sensors in the fingertips so-called Merkel and Meisner endings also named after German anatomists like so many things are are also lost with age so that's a reasonable idea so so this finding from ginty's Lab has opened up a whole world of science and I've been my my own lab doesn't work on touch but I've been a fanboy of touch for for many many years mostly because where I work at Johns Hopkins Medical School there have been many terrific touch researchers it's been a world center for it and I hear about it over lunch and I got all fired up so years ago I wrote a book about it I still follow the field and this is the most interesting thing in that field recently and as I recall ginty was your neighbor at Hopkins before he moved to Harvard that's right that's right he was one of the ones ginty uh uh Stephen Shao Michael Katarina xinjiang dong there have been a number of world leaders in in the cellular basis of sensation at Hopkins do you recall if in the pre-print that you were describing there was an experiment where they activated these Kraus core particles in females it's funny you should mention that I sent that exact email to David ginty and they said they are in the process of doing that right now and they don't quite know yet and so I asked him I said so for example is erection of the clitoris even a thing in mice he says well we're really not sure so we're activating the Kraus corpuscles in female mice and we're just kind of staring at it and looking and see if anything happens just there is you know does the you know does the the body change shape is there a color change they don't even quite know what it is they're looking for because it's that much on the Leading Edge of things but it's a good question or perhaps the female mice would be more willing to mate outside of the usual time frame of receptivity if uh these Kraus corpuscles are are stimulated that's possible my suggestion my my guess would be not because I think that the hormonal regulation of receptivity is like a sledgehammer and very hard to overcome but they might be more willing to continue mating or make for longer during their fertile time and I just want to remind people because we had a guest recently uh Dr Rina Malik who's a urologist reproductive and sexual health expert she's an MD and um she made clear that the the clitoris and the penis come from the same embryonic origin they are analogous tissues in different individuals I do have one more question about this "

            "text": "sexual touch thing um these are peripheral nerves right so these are not of the brain and spinal cord they are in what we call the periphery and my understanding is that peripheral neurons regenerate and can remodel themselves extensively in ways that um neurons within the brain and spinal cord tend to remodel less especially as one gets older out of the so-called critical period um is it possible that these cross corpuscals and their patterns of innervation within the genitals change according to the stimulation that people experience in other words is sexual sensation experience dependent that is a great question and so we don't know because monitoring this in people is not technically possible Right it requires cadaver tissue so you can only do it once in animals it it it it it will be possible and it it could be for a couple of different reasons in other words it could be I think what you're imagining is that there's actual structural plasticity if you looked at these Kraus corpuscles or uh that you would actually see them changing their shape or their size or their or their density as a result of experience but uh what can also happen is a phenomena like desensitization uh that is to say when there's stimulation for a long time then the receptors transiently can become less sensitive to touch and it's well known particularly in males that uh that chronic masturbation can produce sensitization of sexual sensation in the penis and that could be as a result of a physical change a morphological change in the Kraus corpuscles but it's more likely to be a change in their function that you wouldn't be able to Simply see by looking uh at an outline of their structure in the microscope such an interesting topic Thanks for opening things up with with that and I'll have to check out this preprint I'm also a huge fan of David ginty's work and and colleagues there are many people involved in uh that domain of work of course I'd like to talk about "

            "text": "your recent book and the sort of underlying basis of what led you to write it and what intrigued you about this idea of human individuality the book unique is one that we'll provide a link to in the show note captions and um it's a very interesting idea that we are all different especially coming from a neuroscientist who were trained at least similarly to learn that sure the bumps and ripples of the brain and the fine wiring of the brain is different and we are all unique and different we have different shapes AKA morphologies but focusing on human individuality is not something that modern Neuroscience or classic Neuroscience has really done much of it's really focused on how people do X or people do y this way um tell us about unique and tell us about human individuality yeah well I mean you're absolutely right so when I look at the experiments in my own lab how do we do them well we work on mice do we work on mice with genetic variation no we work on highly inbred mice that are designed to be as genetically similar to each other as possible and then we raise them basically in prism in little little cells which may not be a good idea and we try to give them a similar experience as possible they are given toys and food and water but I agree it resembles um a prison of sorts they aren't free to roam they're not they have nothing like the experience of a wild mouse let me put it that way they're uh uh and and yes there are as you said correctly there are plenty of experiments where there is enrichments uh for mice and they love it so for example in our lab when we put running wheels in the cages or mice and let them run overnight they're active at night um your average Mouse will run two kilometers in a night for a little time and some of the mice are so intense they will run 20 kilometers imagine a mouse doing 20K but but it will happen they really really like it they don't like being in prison they want to exercise and they're really bored so yes to get back to your general Point uh so much of science is designed to try to find general principles of of function of the brain a physiology of genetics uh and to ignore individual variation but individual variation is so important to our human experience and actually is so important to to the process of evolution and natural selection and how how species uh make their way in the world that that it's it's something that that requires a lot of attention and to me what's really fascinating is that when you look at the variation in the way sense organs function it's almost a miracle that we can agree on a common reality at all even within the human species and this is true of of more of of of some senses more than others obviously in your world in the retina we have various kinds of of loss of color vision uh that are well known and some other more complicated phenomena having to do with uh impairments in the perception of motion or form but uh the place where this really happens is in the uh olfactory system so we have approximately 400 functional receptors for different odorant molecule smells uh in our nose and if you sequence the genomes of many people you find that the uh that the the DNA that encodes for these odorant receptors is unusually variable from Individual to individual as a matter of fact if you take two different people on average they will have functional differences in 30 percent of their odor receptors and if you do as Leslie vossel and her colleagues did at Rockefeller University and give odor tests where they give people different things to smell and then they dilute them and find the threshold which they can detect them you find enormous changes from People to People both in term in general terms some people are just better smellers than others but in terms of individual odors as well there's some odors that some people can't detect and other people smell one way for example there is a uh there's a secreted hormone called androstenone androstenone there are some people who can't smell it at all for some people uh it smells like rather Pleasant like cut grass and for some people it smells foul like urine or sweat and it just depends on genetic variation in one particular odorant receptor sorry to interrupt uh another uh phenomenal researcher who studies olfaction among other things Catherine dulock um I once heard say that some people have a gene that for them makes the smell of microwave popcorn they experience that smell as vomit and other people who lack this Gene like the smell of microwave popcorn or at least for them it's not aversive so it can really be a binary response well it can actually that's a very particular funny case so the the relevant chemical there is butyric acid and also isovolic acid and so uh there are uh researchers I think Rachel Hertz uh is one of them who have given a mixture of these two chemicals to people if they say this is parmesan cheese they go oh yeah that's parmesan cheese and if they give it to other people and say this is vomit they'll go oh yeah that's vomit and if they tell people they give them one vial and say this is parmesan cheese and they go yeah and I get another one they say it's vomit oh yeah and then they say well actually we fooled you it was the same vial they said no you didn't you must have made a mistake they're convinced that they couldn't have been the same thing so this points out not only is there genetic very nation that uh is responsible for our own individual's perceive odor but we are incredibly suggestible in terms of odors and we we are very dependent upon them in terms of cultural context uh and and this can be this can be learned and and this is Central to our Humanity in the sense that that we humans are what I like to call the anti-pandas uh pandas live in one spot uh in in southern China and they eat one thing bamboo and that's it humans are the opposite humans can live in any ecological niche in the world from the tropics to the poles and humans eat a wide wide wide variety of foods and as a result it means that we have to have a very plastical factory system that have to be very few things that we find innately aversive they're only a handful of odors rotting meat odors uh molecules with the evocative names like cadaverine and putresine are things that even babies when they're newborn find aversive but other things happen that they need to be learned for example um pretty much every adult finds poop odors uh unpleasant but babies happy to happily play with their own poop they have to learn that that's disgusting it's not because babies have a different nose it's because they have to learn culturally not innate it is not innate um there are only a few innate odor aversions and a few innate taste or versions that were were born with and the other things are elaborated culturally and we can think about this in terms of how we we we we talk about odors so for example we might say vanilla smells sweet well that's weird that's like those are two different senses how can something smell sweet it's like saying it sounds red right it's a statement about synesthesia right and but but how did it come to pass and do people say that vanilla smells sweet everywhere in the world well the answer is no so in places in the world where vanilla is used with sugar in in sweet foods like desserts then people say that vanilla smells sweet or mint similarly uh smell sweet if it is typically used together with sugar but if you go to a place like uh like Vietnam where mint is mostly used in Savory dishes people won't say that mint smells sweets so there's a parrot Association there that at least at our level of conscious understanding feeds back onto what we call olfactory or smell perception but really it's a it must be a parrot Association at some point in development yeah it is it absolutely is a paired Association and it's something that goes on continually through your life right I mean lots of people for example have stories of foods that they wouldn't eat as a child but they came to like as an adult a good example of that is coffee a lot of people have to overcome bitter aversion to uh to become coffee aficionados so uh you know this this feeds into the more the more General theme that there is no pure perception perception is inference it's not like there is a purely objective world that can somehow make its way through the senses and we can perceive that as the truth all of our perception through all of our senses both the outward pointing senses of the world like smell and taste and sight and hearing and the inward pointing senses like balance and uh is my stomach full uh and things like that all of them are based on experience and expectation and the situation of the moment as many of you know I've been taking ag1 "

            "text": "visual perception that come to mind I recently did a social media post that involved it was essentially three rings A blue ring um a red ring and a blue ring in the center perhaps it was the other way around excuse me it was red blue red and um I asked which ring is in front or are they all at the in the same plane now of course it's a two-dimensional image right um and interestingly it splits out into about thirds some people see the blue ring in front quite a bit others see a red ring out in front others see them all in the same plane and this uh we think has to do with differences in two things between individuals one is the distribution of the cone photoreceptors which we know is essentially random between individuals maybe even between the two eyes and then um and that gives rise to this phenomenon of chromatic aberration um which is the displacement of the visual image according to the wavelength of the light and we won't get into the physics of it now I'll soon do a post that hopefully distills it in a manner that's simple enough that people understand but clearly some people see certain colors in front of others um and the person right next to them could see the opposite color in front and others say what are you talking about all the colors are in exactly the same plane of of vision so that's the one that I know I'm guessing you know some others and perhaps some more robust ones well I think you know perhaps this is maybe not what you had in mind but one way in which experience modifies the visual world has to do with how much light you're exposed to in the first five years or so of your life and so kids that don't get outside are much more likely to be myopic and it actually is excited nearsighted yes uh uh uh when they grow up uh than kids who got outside and we now know that at least part of the story is that light seems to stimulate the um uh expression of a class of molecules called trophic factors that you're well acquainted with that actually change the shape of the eyeball so it's not really the structure of the retina or the lens of the cornea the actual degree of elongation of the eyeball changes changing the way the the retina sits relative to the lens and that seems to be light dependent early in life and uh which gives rise to uh uh to a higher incidence of myopia and and to me this is really well first of all it's it's it's news you can use you should get your kids outside for absolutely all kinds of reasons and you should get outside too especially in the mornings yeah that circadian rhythm yeah I know that's a famous Huber menesque uh uh uh point they're gonna be putting me in the grave David and I'm going to be telling people to uh or it'll maybe it'll be on my Tombstone he'll say get get sunlight in your eyes especially especially on cloudy days because there is still sunlight even if you can't see the physical object of the sun on cloudy days well you know I think this whole idea of having traits that are dependent upon early life experience is fascinating because there are a number of situations where you would guess that something is genetic but it isn't it's actually dependent on early life experience and there's a there's an amazing story about this having to do with the early days of World War II so in the early days of World War II the Japanese Army just swept through Asia they defeated the the British and Malaysia and Singapore they overrun Thailand and Burma and they were knocking on the gates of India and everything was going great except the Japanese Army had a problem there were an enormous number of their soldiers who became incapacitated with heat stroke they got their core temperature got too hot and when the Army doctors uh examine them they found this was much more likely to happen in soldiers who came from the northern part of Japan Hokkaido where it's uh where it snows in the winter as opposed to the southern part of Japan like Kyushu which is a semi-tropical environment and the classical explanation the biologists like us would guess would say oh all right well this has happened genetically over many years uh you have a family that's been in Kyushu for many generations and you've selected four Gene variants that allow you to tolerate the heat better and we know actually what this is so if you're more heat tolerant it's because you have more of a particular class of sweat gland called the ekrine sweat glands the sort of salt water sweat glands not the Liberty stinky armpit sweat glands called the apricorn ones the echron ones you have a higher fraction of them that are innervated meaning that the signals from your brain that say your core is too hot can then make you sweat so the total density of sweat glands between northern and southern soldiers in Japan wasn't different but the southern soldiers tend to have a higher degree of innervation all right so okay well this happened genetically over many generations but if you look at those rare cases where you had soldiers from a long-established northern family and their parents moved South and then they grew up in the southern location they had high sweat gland innervation they were well tolerant conversely if you had a well-established Southern Kyushu family and they moved to Hokkaido and then had their child that child developed the northern sweat gland innervation pattern so meaning less nerve innervation of those sweat glands as you mentioned before just as many sweat glands just less nerve innervation therefore those sweat glands could not be activated they couldn't dump heat as well their heat tolerance was lower exactly right and and what's what's what's wonderful is that this gives an advantage that you can't get through Evolution and that it can happen right away in this in in one generation right evolutionary change is slow right and you can adapt as a species and as a family over over many many many generations but when you have a phenomenon that is set by uh early life experience well then you can benefit from that early life experience within your own life it's not that your great great great great grandchildren will ultimately benefit you benefit another wonderful example of this uh comes from field mice voles and we were talking earlier about how we both worked with the scientist Irv Zucker at uh at Berkeley who was a specialist in uh in in involves and uh what people found is that if you take a wild caught uh field mice and uh you have uh pregnant mothers and you have them in the lab but you manipulate the lights so that uh you have artificial spring in other words day length is getting longer day after day during the pregnancy then what happens is when their pups were are born they will have a low density of fur anticipating summer temperatures uh if you however uh put them in artificial fall where day length is getting shorter uh they will be born now with high density of for anticipating winter temperatures and of course you can do this no matter what the season actually is in the world by manipulating these lights in the lab and so like the sweating Japanese soldiers this is a great example of early life plasticity and just the sort of trait that if you ask someone they would probably guess is heritable but actually is not thanks for mentioning Irv Zucker who has you also mentioned was an advisor to us both who's done incredible work in circadian biology seasonal rhythms hormones and behavior I have such reverence for Irv and the experiment you mentioned made me smile wide because it's but one of gosh maybe hundreds of incredible studies so if people are interested in seasonal rhythms and circadian rhythms and biology of the most interesting kind definitely check out Irving zucker's work at Berkeley we'll I'll provide a link to his uh PubMed uh there since we've been taking a tour of individual "

            "text": "individuality that extend beyond the percept chin domain into the cognitive domain well yeah absolutely and uh you know I think I think it's good to set the stage here if we're going to be talking about heritability and human individuality and and so if I can go off on a little bit of a riff uh uh for the benefit of your of your listeners and viewers here so if you look at human traits whether they're behavioral traits like shyness or very straightforward morphological traits like height uh what you tend to find is that there are very few traits that are entirely heritable where all their variability can be predicted based on the gene variants you get from your mother and father and there are a few traits that are absolutely unheritable but that most fall in between so let me give an example everyone in the world has either wet or dry earwax and it turns out that this is determined by variation in the single Gene the name of the gene is boring it's abcc11 uh it's a ion transporter and uh there's a variation in this Gene gives rise to either web or dry earwax it doesn't matter how your parents raised you it doesn't matter what foods you ate growing up doesn't matter what what uh diseases your mother had when you're on the womb it's 100 percent heritable well does this mean that abcc11 we should call it the earwax type Gene well no because it's not there just for that like this this Gene is expressed in cells in all parts of the body doing all kinds of things earwax is just something that we notice genes don't code for traits they code for proteins and so we have to be careful about how we refer to them in that way um for example the wet earwax G variant of the abcc 11 Gene also confers a slightly higher risk for breast cancer uh so clearly it's not just for earwax it's it's for a bunch of things most of which we don't yet know about but in the case of earwax this trade is 100 heritable at the other end of the scale speech accent is zero percent heritable it is entirely dependent upon the speech that you experience uh in your childhood and interestingly it's the speech of your peers more than the speech of your family which is why the children of immigrants sound like the place where they wound up not like their parents and there is no evidence for any degree of heritability not just to be clear I'm talking about speech accent like whether you have a high or a low voice or it's nasal or more or less resonant these are physical things having to do with the vocal tract and they are in part heritable Okay so we've got one thing that's 100 heritable one thing is zero percent heritable but where do most Things Fall most Things fall in the middle uh uh one of the most heritable traits that we know about in humans is height and in the United States height is about 85 percent heritable 85 percent of the variation in the trade of height can be explained uh by what you inherit from your mother and your father well what's the rest well it's nutrition it's the diseases you fought off it's also random variation which we'll talk about a lot later um now you might say okay well that's an estimate for people in the U.S is this true all over the world well no if you go to a place where people routinely don't get enough nutrition and are routinely fighting off infectious diseases like this has been studied in rural Bolivia for example or rural India now height is no longer 85 percent heritable it's only 50 percent terrible why because people in these situations where they don't get enough nourishment where they're fighting off these diseases can't live up to their genetic potential for height if you want to make things better for the people of the world then everyone needs to have basic things like the ability to learn and enough nutrition and and decent Medical Care and schools in order to fulfill their genetic potential for positive traits and uh height I've used as an example because it is very uncontroversial but we could apply the very same analysis to intelligence general intelligence now there are people who argue about do things like IQ tests really measure anything real and there's been a lot of fighting in the scientific literature about this but I think intelligence tests aren't perfect and they are sometimes culture bound but they are actually quite predictive of of of of of later success and uh much more so than say sat tests or GRE tests or mcats or other standardized tests presumably those correlate in some way they do Baidu but but but the IQ tests are better actually they're talking about the the classic IQ test I am talking about the modern variants of the classic IQ tests that are administered by trans psychologists uh and aren't just a paper form and so they're not perfect and no test will be perfect but they're pretty good and so then if you ask the question well what is the heritage ability for IQ test score well the answer tends to be different depending upon the population if you look again in in countries like the us or in Western Europe that are fairly affluent where where people tend to have good access to to nutrition and medical care and schooling and kids get to play and they're not and they're not traumatized by War then uh then IQ test score is heritable in the ballpark of 60 70 percent but if you look at people who don't have those benefits who are poor and this can be in the United States as well if you look at uh communities that that uh face discrimination and have consistently poor poor health care in schools then IQ is less heritable why for the very same reason that it is in height because people can't live up to their genetic potential when they don't have the basic things that everybody needs so presumably if two identical twins "

            "text": "and I realize they aren't identical but you're familiar with twins you have twin children um if two identical twins are raised separately uh the correlation in their IQ it can only is it that only 60 I think you said about 66 percent of their IQ can be predicted on the basis of their genetic makeup Alone um I mean it makes perfect sense to me as to why if one of those twins went to schools that were demanding of you know a lot of different topic matter and the other one went to schools where the instruction level was really deficient that one would perform far less well on an IQ test unless of course the IQ test isn't tapping into school-based knowledge it's tapping into some other um thermometer of of so-called intelligence or IQ well you know the thing is that good schools correlate with many other things right so the students that go to good schools aren't just benefiting from good schools they tend to also have good medical care and safer less traumatizing neighborhoods and they're more likely to have books parents with books in the home and uh uh and and a whole number of things that are all beneficial so when you try to do epidemiology on this you have to be aware that things are very deeply interconnected but but you bring up a good point so it turns out that the way we get these estimates of heritability there's two ways one way is to compare so-called identical or monozygotic twins with so-called fraternal or dizygotic twins so the identical twins will share nearly a hundred percent of their Gene variants and on average fraternal twins share 50 percent of their uh of their Gene variants and generally speaking when people do these studies in order to avoid confounds of sex they'll compare same-sex fraternal twins so boys to boys and girls to girls uh uh and uh when you put these incidents into a formula called Fischer's equation then you can come up with an estimate of the heritability of the trade but there is an assumption presence in that and it's called the equal environment assumption you're saying well two kids raised in the same family have the same environments well that's not always true right that can be violated by a number of uh of different situations so it turns out that a more powerful but much more difficult way to estimate heritability is by looking at twins reared apart either identical twins or fraternal twins reared apart and there was a landmark study called the Minnesota study of twins reared apart which is abbreviated mystra that is really the gold standard for assessing the heritability of many different human traits both behavioral traits but also disease incidents but of course it's a small M because you know the population of identical twins reared apart that you can get into the lab isn't isn't that large they had something I don't remember the exact numbers but they had something like 80 some uh identicals and 50 some fraternals uh in their in their sample but by doing this they were able to come up with a lot of interesting estimates and so for example most uh personality traits uh what the psychologists uh use the acronym ocean to mean openness conscientiousness empathy agreeableness and neuroticism I think I got that right spelled right uh that these traits on average tend to be about 50 percent heritable and so okay you say right well fifty percent of those personality traits is heritable the rest has got to be like how you were raised it's got to be in your family and so everyone was shocked when they actually did the analysis um and found that family has almost nothing to do with it is what what are are you kidding it's it's it's it's it's it's got to and I think the important thing to realize is these traits I just listed you know we call these personality traits but they are not the sum total of the way you are in the world parents can inculcate many things in their children they can demonstrate trades so people are much more likely to go into an occupation if their parents did they can inculcate moral ideas and religious ideas but in terms of these ocean personality traits they have astonishingly little to do with it so then this brings up the question well if 50 of the variation in these personality traits is not from your genetics and it's not from your family where does it come from and the answer seems to be is that it comes from the random nature of the development of the body and the nervous system and this is this is a point that I think many people don't understand this is something that biologists know but we've done a very poor job of communicating to the general public The genome all your DNA all three billion bases of DNA all 19 000 or so genes in a human don't make a blueprint for making your body and brain there it's not a schematic diagram that connects everything to everything particularly in the nervous system where we have these hundreds of trillions of connections rather it's a rather vague recipe so the The genome doesn't say oh okay you glutamate using neuron in the brain region called the thalamus you know grow for 200 microns towards the top and then and then and then cross the midline and then grow towards the ear for you know another distance no it says something like hey you bunch of glutamate neurons in the thalamus over here in this area about half of you cross the midline and so what does this mean in terms of individual variation well it means well first for for some individuals 40 of their axons will cross the midline of the brain and for another individual 60 will in identical twins and as you correctly said a moment ago identical twins aren't really identical either in their bodies or their temperament so if you take newborn identical twins and you give them a CT scan just to measure the shape of their organs they're not the same you might have one twin whose spleen is 30 larger than the than the other Twins or whose liver is 30 smaller than the other twins even though they have the exact same DNA and they're relying right next to each other in the womb and presumably have the same or very similar fetal environment and the reason is the random or as we say stochastic nature of neural development a great way to study this is with nine banded armadillos I know we're getting weird here but I love the armadillo because I've been told tell me I don't want to uh uh interrupt you too long but um as far as I know the only animal in North America that carries leprosy uh that is that is true and um and there's a lot of twinning going on in Armadillos right well what there is is actually quadding so armadillos or the nine-bounded armadillo in particular and they're different armadillos I'm not really an armadillo specialist I don't know if this holds for all of them but the nine banded armadillo is born as identical quadruplets awesome awesome so you can take these identical quadruplet newly born armadillo I don't know you think you call them pups I don't know what a baby armadillo was called I'm sure there's some particular word for it and someone will tell us I'm sure someone like comments on YouTube what is the name of a baby armadillo I know like a ferret baby ferrets are kits uh the moms are jills the dads are bobs I used to be obsessed with this kind of naming it you know it's a it's a business of ferrets or uh what is like a gang of raccoons or whatever so if you can tell us what the name is for the baby armadillos as well as what do you call a group of armadillos um you win the pride associated with being right that's right right one of my favorites is on on ostentation of peacocks amazing or a murder of crows who comes up with this stuff I know it's a raft of otters I think that I think that's correct but so if you have four newborn uh identical nine founded armadillos then this is a great model system that biologists can use to study uh uh stochastic differences in development and and sure enough their brands are wired slightly differently their bodies are slightly different if you test them behaviorally even very very early in life they have different propensities some are bolder we'll Explore More some are will tend to hide in the corner more and you know we know this from the lab you get a box of mice that are inbred from the breeder and you pluck them out and they're not behaviorally identical some might try to bite your hand some will run away some will stand stuck still where does this behavioral variation come from in mice that are nearly genetically identical well it comes from a bunch of things they don't always have exactly equal experience but mostly it comes from the pseudo-random stochastic nature of development I'd like to take a quick break and "

mutations are bad but of course mutations provide the variation that can also subserve adaptive traits I mean if you're a fan of the X-Men as I am a huge fan of the X-Men the entire series every single one including the Wolverine movies you quickly come to learn that genetic mutation is at the heart of variation which is at the heart of individuality which is what we're talking about right and so genetic variation is at the heart of individuality but there is also there are also these other things right that we've talked about there's the effects of early life experience and there is the stochastic nature of development because if you through the randomness of development happen to have like a particularly great liver you're not going to pass that on to your children right that isn't in your germline you won't pass that trait along just a brief insert here on germline we had ODed rashafi on the podcast who studies um epigenetic transmission and um and an inheritance of uh of of it's not lamarckian we have to point that out but um inheritance of of uh sort of acquired traits uh does happen and uh the germline it's the genes that are present in the the sperm and in the eggs all the other uh cells of your body have genes of course but um the best way to put this is uh simply going to the gym and getting fit um does not make your children more fit because the germline as far as we know is not modified in a direct way uh in other words the DNA within sperm and eggs are not modified according to your behaviors in most but not all cases that's right and and as you uh as you correctly said about oded's work and other people's work there is what's called transgenerational epigenetic inheritance which means that you can have traits that are passed not from one generation to the next but even two generations to the grandchildren that don't require modification of DNA but to date that has been shown very convincingly in in worms found in plants uh the evidence in mammals is is really not there yet in in my opinion and most of the claims for that and it's a very popular thing to say I epigenetically inherited my grandmothers or great-grandmother's trauma uh the evidence at Presence is is poor actually a lot of it comes from epidemiology most of which came from famines in the other colics region of Northern Sweden and they had very good medical records and they said oh well if your grandfather went through the famine then you're more likely to have this trait if you're male or if your grandmother went through this then if you're if you're male this train you're female or that trait and I mean there are two problems one is that there's not a biological mechanism but the other problem is that the way these things were discovered is by something called harking or hypothesizing after the results are known uh they did very many statistical comparisons to try to find something significant and you know from your work in the lab that when you do many comparisons you're going to get some things that look significant just occasionally a randomly through through luck and you have to apply a statistical correction called a bonferoni correction when you make many particularly post-hoc comparisons after the experiment uh comparisons to set the bar much higher for accepting that data and most of those studies they didn't apply that correction and I remain unconvinced of transgenerational epigenetic inheritance in mammals now let's be clear just because it hasn't been shown convincingly now it doesn't mean that it won't be there are some good people working very hard on this and they may well uh describe a mechanism and show this convincingly in the years to come but right now uh you may well inherit your grandmas or great grandma's trauma but you're probably doing it socially not through marks on your DNA that changes how your genes are expressed or not expressed yes so I subscribe to the idea that there is absolutely certainly transgenerational inheritance of parenting and upbringing right I mean your grandparents raise your parents who raise you not always people can be adopted in fact I have adopted members of my family um but I understand what you're saying correctly the evidence that for instance some stress-related Gene was modified during a trauma in my grandparents are great grandparents and the idea that that was passed to me through my parents that the evidence there is is far weaker right and when you think about it well like how did that happen that had to get into your your grandparents sperm or egg cell and then produce that effect in the brain of your parents and then it had to get into their sperm or Excel and then contribute to producing it in you but fragmentation of DNA and sperm is um or in eggs is is a is a common um thing especially as people age DNA sperm and eggs fragment um and it's possible that some of those mutations still allow for viable embryos so it's in theory the germline could be changed by um environmental events well right but now I think you're starting to talk about things that are heritable right you're not talking about marks on DNA you're talking about the structure of the DNA right itself and that is its own separate issue now I think I want to be really careful about this because what "

            "text": "is now I think fairly well established is that you can transfer things epigenetically over a single generation uh if as a result of experiences that the mother has during pregnancy so uh for example we know that during the 1918 pandemic flew uh many women were pregnant and got the flu and if you look at their children you find interesting statistical anomalies and those children for example the males wound up going into the army for World War II and of course the Army does a complete physical and the records are very good so you can go into that database and you find that uh the male children uh that were uh in utero during the winter of 1918 during the pandemic flu or on average a millimeter or two shorter you might say a millimeter or two that's nothing but in a huge statistical sample of millions of people that's enormously significant more interesting is that the incidence of schizophrenia went up about four fold from about one percent to about four percent and even though autism wasn't a term in 1918 yet uh I think came along later what we now retrospectively would call autism also went up by about four-fold so there's something about mom being stressed and carrying the fetus at a particular stage that seems to impact brain development in a way that then makes that child more likely to be schizophrenic or autistic when they grow up do we know that it's stress and my recollection of this I believe this was um the late Paul sternberg's work as well uh maybe have that name um incorrect but in any event that it is if pregnant mom gets the flu in the first trimester you see this higher incidence of schizophrenia and autistic Offspring um and but do we know that it's stress per se because it's stressful to have the flu but the flu is a bunch of other things it could be fever could be um some breakdown in the immune barrier I just want to open up the the number of variables that this could be do or do we know that it's something in the hypothalamic pituitary so-called stress axis that is adrenals um so hypothalamic pituitary adrenal axis um like is it elevated cortisol um or could it literally be an immune neural interaction of some other sort it's probably the last thing you mentioned an immune neural interaction and the reason I say that is that uh Gloria Choi at MIT uh uh together with her collaborators has made a mouse model of this phenomena so she takes pregnant female mice and she injects them with something that that it's she doesn't actually infect them with virus she puts so chemical limb that is on the code of viruses that mimics viral infection and uh then what happens is that in a way that interestingly is an interaction with the with the bacterial content of her of her guts produces a surge of a immune signaling molecule called interleukin 17. interleukin 17 can pass through the placenta into the fetus and if it's present just as you said at a particular point in development doesn't work anywhere during pregnancy but during something that is sort of the mouse equivalent of the first trimester if that occurs it causes disorder development of the layers of the cortex instead of it looking like layers of a cake you see balls and clumps of cells and parenthetically in some but not all postmortem tissue from autistic people you can also see those balls and clumps of cells are those balls and clumps of cells thought to reflect um alterations in cell migration they are yeah some some I don't know if it's entirely known how much of it is selled Vision or migration but certainly migration is a part of it and it's very likely that that critical moment uh to disrupt this ordering of the brain and produce these increases in schizophrenia or or uh autism vulnerability uh are coming at a point where neurons are migrating uh during development and uh so what choice group did is they did all the things we would want to do as a biologist so they gave things to block the function of of this interleukin signaling molecule and it blocked the phenomenon they artificially injected the signaling molecule into fetal brain when the mom hadn't been stressed and they could they could reproduce it so I'm not saying that there aren't effects of stress hormones from the hypothalamic pituitary axis that are important that you mentioned but in this mouse model system work it seems that you can produce it through this immune signaling pathway and and so then the question is well like are these mice autistic well how do you know if a mouse is autistic and the answer is it's actually a little vague right there are behaviors that neuroscientists say are analogous of human autism and one of them is If You Give a Mouse a marble in its home cage it will bury it over and over again compulsively or bury many marbles and people say that that is somehow analogous to some of the compulsive behaviors you see an Autism it's a bit of a stretch right I mean it's a challenge to interpret mouse behavior done in human terms but um it's a reasonable first step credible and uh I hope more will continue to be done as it surrounds the uh first trimester influenza hypothesis because it's been around a while and um and obviously there's a spectrum of what we call autism Mass burgers and nowadays people refer to it as sometimes as neuroatypical there's some high functioning people with Autism there's some low functioning people with Autism and for that matter there's some high functioning and low-functioning people who don't have autism so um but it is something that I think uh demands our attention and and it that hopefully will be resolved at some point because also influenza is uh but one immune uh insult um and presumably pregnant women are being bombarded with all sorts of viruses and bacteria and fungal infections and fighting them off we're not fighting them off and who knows what the variation in uh neuro immune interactions exist in there that give rise to you know good variation and let's call it um you know uh debilitating variation well that's that's absolutely right and so for one example is that uh we don't know what the effects are on the children who were in utero while their mothers were fighting off covet right we won't know for uh for a while or the common cold and there might I mean there might be nothing but or there might be something serious uh lurking there like there was for pandemic flu uh and will be very interesting and uh and important to find out agreed I'd love to talk with you about mind "

            "text": "body but before we do that I would be totally remiss if I didn't ask for your um Broad top Contour understanding of the mini brain the cerebellum right the so-called mini brain and here's why I've been a practicing neuroscientist for you know close to three decades I know where the cerebellum is I've dissected a bunch of them I um I could tell you where a few things are in there and I certainly have read about what the cerebellum does but whenever I do a PubMed search on cerebellum I see an ever expanding set of things that the cerebellum is implicated in not just balance as most people hear but also timing also cognition I hear about timing in particular of motor Behavior but then I also hear that it's involved in learning and not just motor learning and it certainly is involved in motor learning perhaps that little mini brain is uh doing 50 or a thousand different things but how should we think about the cerebellum what is it doing and what are some of its core operations that inform both what it's doing and perhaps what other areas of the brain are doing as well because I can point to the retinas or the auditory cortex or the thalamus and yes there's some mysterious nuclei in the brain but to me the cerebellum is one of the most cryptic and complicated structures to understand and I know you spent some time in there so what's the cerebellum do well uh cerebellar researchers like to joke that the cerebellum is a counterweight to keep your head from falling forward oh perfect well with all the texting nowadays people need bigger Ceramics that's right that's right probably over many generations then that will happen along with an expansion of the thumbs uh so uh but of course everybody's going to text with their minds in about another 10 years right you'll have elong's implants and you won't need your thumbs at all yeah or maybe just five or my friend Eddie Chang is a neurosurgeon and uh works on the auditory system he's been on this podcast before he was saying that if in theory and actually in practice you could just record the neural output to the muscles of the speech system essentially and you could just amplify that and you could text without actually speaking um in fact when we read he told me uh we are actually receiving the signals as if we were going to speak the words we're reading but they don't quite arrive at the place where you could get a full-blown post-synaptic potential so you're not actually moving the vocal Machinery so that means the motor signals are getting sent out there and so you're speaking what you are reading but you just don't know it that's right it's very analogous to what happens during the REM phase of sleep right when you have commands your brain is issuing commands to your muscles to to do things like behave in your dreams to run away or go here or go there uh but those signals actually are blocked and the brainstem prevented from from reaching your muscles because the uh nerves that don't go through your brain stem like the ones that control your eye movements aren't subject to that blockade that's why you can produce the rapid eye movements in in REM sleep but yeah this is a general theme in the brain a lot of times you have the output but then you shut it down and there are REM sleep behavior disorders where people thrash and move in their sleep uh during during REM and uh it's because this outflow that's normally blocked isn't isn't blocked have you ever had the reverse happen uh I have where you wake up and you're still in so-called rematonia you're still paralyzed yes and there's that Split Second that feels like eternity where you are wide awake and you cannot move and I'll tell you it's terrifying yeah a sleep paralysis and actually you know it's been known uh forever you can actually find ancient Greek depictions of people lying with a demon on their chest paralyzing them and that is actually from sleep paralysis later Hogarth uh did a drawing uh of exactly that uh so yeah this is a well-known phenomenon but to get back to the cerebellum uh as we started um so the cerebellum is as you said definitely involved in motor coordination so people who have damage to the cerebellum aren't paralyzed but they tend to be clumsy uh they tend to not coordinate their movements they have a disturbed gate if they're reaching for an object they often overshoot it and have to make successive approximating motions to get back uh to their target so that's well understood but if you look through Evolution the cerebellum is connected to this brain region called the thalamus and it's connected from there to many regions including the frontal cortex where phenomena like uh like planning and uh decision making and uh moral sense and many aspects of Personality seem to be encoded so then the question becomes well that's very far away from being clumsy what are these connections doing and as time has gone on I've been in this business from over 40 years now I'm an old guy and so initially we said oh yeah cerebellum movement control motor coordination that's what it's for as time goes on as you correctly said the cerebellum has been implicated in more and more functions many of which are far removed from the motor system and if we're looking for a theme about what the cerebellum does is that it is there to predict the immediate future it's trying to determine what's going to happen in the next second or two to best God behavior and as you can imagine this kind of General computation could be applied very well you can see why it's important for you know motor systems and doing sports and you know if you're trying to hit a baseball and looking at what the pitcher is doing and trying to anticipate what the pitch is but it also comes up in a social realm if we're trying to read someone and predict what they are going to do is this person Friend or Foe which is one of the first things that we try to assess when meeting someone are they competent which is the second thing we try to assess uh when meeting something a lot of this depends upon predictive circuitry and uh it depends in part on the cerebellum and it seems to be at least partially impaired in people who sustain cerebellar damage so it seems as if interestingly the cerebellum started out for prediction related for motor control and through Evolution its basic computation has been applied to other non-motor behaviors now I'm speaking in generalities and a lot of the details of this remain to be worked out and understood but I would say that is in a nutshell the modern conception of the cerebellum thank you finally somebody explains to me that a top Contour but highly informed way what the cerebellum does I couldn't be more grateful my pleasure in all aspects of biology and life the term nature versus nurture is "

stuff that genes just set up neurons wire up to that neuron Etc the cerebellum's in the back the eyes are in the front the hard-wired stuff and then the soft wired stuff the nurture stuff is the stuff that can be modified by experience what are your thoughts on nature versus nurture and should there even be a versus in there yeah I don't think there should and and I have a lot of problems with nature versus nurture as uh as an expression it was popularized by Francis Galton uh in the 19th century a colleague of uh of uh of Darwin's and I think it's wrong in or misleading in a lot of ways so of course the nature in nature versus nurture is meant in this case to me inheritability right what you inherit in the gene variations from your mother and father and nurture means like how your parents or your community raised you uh the problem I have with nurture is that it is too narrow a term that really it should be replaced with the word experience and experience in the broadest possible sense not just social experience but uh the foods your mother ate when she was carrying you in utero um the diseases you fought off or your mother fought off while she was carrying you uh in utero the bacterial population of your guts uh so experience meaning anything that impinges on you starting from the earliest stages of fetal developments uh continuing to the last day of your life I think it should be very expansive much much more than social experience in the family or the or the community and as you mentioned I have a problem with a versus because there's this idea that these things are are essentially in opposition well is he that way because of of of his Gene variants or is that way because of what what happened to him and I think the thing to realize is that uh experience and heredity interact in all kinds of interesting ways some of which are oppositional and some of which are reinforcing a classic one from genetics has to do with a genetic disease called phenylketonuria or PKU which is an inability to uh to metabolize uh the dietary amino acid phenylalanine and uh so uh in order to have this you have to inherit broken copies of this Gene from both your mother and your father so it's a so-called recessive trait and here's where the experience comes in it only matters if you eat foods rich in the phenylalanine if you don't it doesn't matter that you inherited these things right so that's a way in which genes and experience interact an idea of in ways in which then they interact positively um think about athletic ability right so a lot of athletic ability is has a heritable component if you are born fast for example uh then you're more likely to do Sports and practice them and get better exports as a result of your experience so here genes and experience are feeding back on each other in a positive feedback loop so there really isn't a versus a versus at all and then of course the last thing is that this isn't the entirety so we talked earlier about the pseudo-random nature of development stochastic development and so if I were to take the phrase nature versus nurture and reconfigure it I would change it to read heritability interacting with experience filtered through the random nature of development now that doesn't fall off the tongue as elegantly as nature versus nurture you know nature versus nurture is like if the govs the gloves don't fit you must quit you know it's got that kind of Snappy snare drum beats but I think it's it's a more accurate so heritability interacting with experience filtered through the randomness of development yeah so we can shorten that up and um and we'll just call it um uh the Linden hypothesis you know I I don't think I can take credit for that it belongs to other people sure but um but there's a long history in science of of things being shortened up and uh coined and that's uh as important and I'm not we're not trying to rob attribution here um uh and the good news is perhaps you can't call it the Linden hypothesis but I can all right and what I've found is as with the Galpin equation which is now out there as a hydration it's a formula a formula that gives broad but um research informed parameters as to how much water one should drink in order to maintain proper hydration for physiologists Dr Andy Galpin who's a PhD in uh physiology and an expert in all aspects of exercise science there's the Galpin equation there's the soberg principle so I'm naming these things left and right all right um where appropriate and um so I'm naming these things uh sparingly and where appropriate um so from here on out heritability interacting with experience filtered through the randomness of development is the Linden hypothesis and I'll be damned if anyone's going to rename it uh um faster than I'm going to propagate it all right well I think all the the geneticists will be gnashing their teeth about this being named after someone who isn't actually a geneticist quite all right and their dentists will thank me let's talk about Mind Body okay I'm fascinated by this "

            "text": "um for a couple of reasons and I promise to keep this brief but when I was growing up I was very interested in animals and biology and my father's a scientist and I got very interested in Neuroscience early um as people perhaps know and so much of Neuroscience as I was coming up through the mid 90s 2000s 2010 to 20 stretch was focused on the brain piece very little on the body there was nothing about gut brain access in the early discussions and coursework um in parallels all of that I've been interested in mental health physical health and let's just call it performance and um got interested in meditation respiration based practices things like Yoga Nidra things that by way of experience I understood immediately had a profound influence on the nervous system states of Mind and Body nowadays there's an entire Institute at the National Institutes of Health for complementary health and Medicine essentially exploring things like Yoga Nidra respiration practices even supplements and things of that sort and there's this understanding that oh my goodness the nervous system extends into the body and the body sends neural signals back into the brain and so this whole notion of Mind Body has fortunately migrated away from kind of um California Counter Culture esselen Institute only uh you know um hippie New Age Magic Carpet stuff by the way that's not what I believe that's but that's often how it was looked at in the past and now people at every level of science and medicine at every major university and in every scientific journal are starting to publish papers about the interactions between bodily organs like the breathing apparati the diaphragm lungs the heart heart rate variability we hear about the liver the gut brain axis in particular and so Mind Body the idea that our thoughts could influence our body and that our bodily State could influence our thoughts is fortunately not just understood but it seems to be both accepted and appreciated so what are your thoughts on Mind Body what does that mean to you and what do you think is the potential of the mind-body interaction it seems to me we've just barely scratched the surface yeah well I'm glad you asked because I think it's a it's a really fascinating uh situation and uh where things are changing very very quickly and I think to me the most important thing for people to understand is that when you have a hypothesis let's say you have a hypothesis that uh meditation can attenuate chronic pain all right well there is a temptation to think that this operates outside the realm of Science and biology that is in some Airy fairy realm in the clouds that this happens and and and I mean for for good reason there are a lot of people who will describe it in exactly that way with auras or they they clop scientific terms like resonance and energy but they don't actually use them in scientific ways so you know there's a lot of very fuzzy language that surrounds this but it shouldn't obscure the facts that when you have a hypothesis that say some mental state like meditation or or guided breathing uh uh affects some process in the body that you should be trying to understand this in terms of a biological hypothesis not in terms of some some some indistinct realm that that is that is different like manifestation yeah and you know I really learned this initially from my father my father was a psychiatrist in fact kind of a talking cure old-fashioned psychoanalyst how does practice in uh Los Angeles and uh we would have dinner together every Wednesday nights and uh he would always tell me about his patience he was very careful to keep confidentiality right he wouldn't break confidentiality but you know I would say oh this how's your narcissist oh we had this dream you know so this was you know this was this was normal conversation when I was 14 15 years old with my dad and one day I said Dad it's really clear to me that through this talking cure a large fraction of your patients feel better and they conquer their depression or or their obsessive thoughts or things that are blocking them how do you think it works and he says well we don't really know the mechanics But ultimately when it works it's not working in some area farrier realm it is working by changing the biology of the brain and when he said that it was like a lightning bolt went off in my head and I thought well I don't have the kind of personality to be a talking cure psychiatrist I'm not nearly nice enough but I could understand the underlying biology maybe I'll do that and so as you've correctly pointed out when you say the phrase Mind Body you're talking about two directions you're talking about mental functions affecting the body and then you are also talking about how phenomena in the body affects affect the mind and we're understanding so much more about how that happens and I think the general thing for your your listeners to appreciate is that we have some culprits here right and generally speaking there are there are two classes of culprits so if you want to get signals about the body to the mind there's two ways to do that one of them is through neurons that reach out into the body and sense things and this is referred to as introception right so as opposed to extra reception your outward pointing senses these are the senses that monitor your own body and and while we can consciously be aware of a lot of that information a lot of it is happening subconsciously like your breathing is happening automatically most of the time without you thinking about it and that depends upon sensors about your blood chemistry and the state of your lungs and a number of other things that are regulating that process and it's all happening in the brain usually below the level of your conscious attention in addition to the neural signals there is also a whole realm of hormonal or diffusible immune signals and what these are is that these are chemicals that are released into the bloodstream and that move throughout the body and that can uh activate neurons in the brain or in other parts of the nervous system to produce changes in uh in mental in mental function and I think the real thing that is exciting a lot of people right now has to do with immune signaling molecules so there's a class of molecules called cytokines and cytokines are basically the signaling hormones of the immune system and they they can flow through the bloodstream and through lymphatic fluid and reach many parts of the body uh we've known for a number of years that the specialized receptors for these cytokines are found throughout the brain and yet we know very very very little about what they do and that's going to be an astonishingly fruitful area of scientific research but but to give one one Exemplar "

            "text": "um there are a lot of things these days suggesting uh a link between inflammation in the body whether it be in the gut or in other places to depression well how might that work well it could work either through inflammation sensing neurons sending electrical signals to the brain or and it's not either or it could be both it could be immune signaling cytokine molecules produced at the site of inflammation that then travel through the bloodstream and the lymphatic system to then reach the brain bind receptors and have effects and so you know one of the mysteries about depression is that uh it's not that tractable to pharmacological therapy so if you look at people who suffer with depression about a third of people see significant benefit from Modern SSRI and related antidepressant drugs uh about a third see very tiny benefit on about a third scene no benefit at all and part of the reason is because maybe our term depression is too big a bucket depression is actually many different biological disorders and only a subset of those are are helped by ssris and will need different therapies for the other ones that's certainly part of it um but part of it might actually have to do with inflammation so if you think that inflammation is a risk factor in depression well you could do something very simple right you could you could gobble an ibuprofen right there's a whole bunch of anti-inflammatory drugs that are very well understood and so well what if you just say all right you know uh let's have a study where we have a bunch of depressed people and we have them all eat anti-inflammatory drugs for a few weeks and we see if this relieves their depression and the answer seems to be no it doesn't well and that's that's a little bit hard to understand because there are definitely links between inflammation and depression so for example one of the early treatments for uh for Hepatitis C that's since been superseded by more modern drugs was a pro-inflammatory cytokine molecule and when you gave it to people to treat their hepatitis C almost everyone became depressed on this drug so he said oh well this really seems like like like a link likewise there are certain uh neurological diseases like multiple sclerosis it turns out the incidence of depression as a comorbidity in multiple sclerosis is enormous and you might think well there's a trivial reason for that if you're paralyzed from Ms you're bummed out about life and that's the reason but if you look at people who have spinal cord injuries from accidents they actually have major depression at a nor at a rate from people who are uninjured so that doesn't seem to be it it's not just that you're bummed out from being paralyzed although of course it's reasonable to be bummed out about being paralyzed but that's not it so what happens in Ms well there's a bunch of cytokines including one called interleukin-6 il-6 that's elevated massively if you if you take a spinal tap and you look at cerebral spinal fluid and so that could be causative for depression so all these real reasons to think that inflammation is involved but yet the idea is still a little messy so now what if instead of looking at the general population of depressed people you look at the subset of people that don't respond to SSRI antidepressants are they helped by anti-inflammatories and there there's a bit of a hint that maybe they are it's not definitive yet there are a couple of studies it's it's right on the edge but I think this is a really good example of how we are going to see progress very soon in the body to mind part of mind body medicine that is going to be of enormous uh benefit to people so interesting could I get your thoughts "

            "text": "on one candidate hypothesis that I've been thinking about I've covered depression on a few episodes and um I've had a Robin cardard Harris from UCSF and Dr Matthew Johnson from your very own John Hopkins University both of whom work run Laboratories studying psychedelics for the treatment of depression the clinical trials on psilocybin and to be clear so Simon's still illegal it's been decriminalized a few places but we're not talking about recreational use we're talking about several therapy sessions and then two without psilocybin then two 2.5 gram approximately dosages of psilocybin given separately again with therapists present and then follow-up therapy sessions seem to lead to relief of depression in approximately somewhere between 65 and 80 percent of people in some cases total remission in some cases some relief without remission okay so we can kind of set that result on the Shelf it's been repeated a number of different times compare that to the results of ssris which seem to help a third of people a third minimally and a third not at all and of course there's the side effect profiles of the ssris and Associated drugs not just the ssris but proprion and the other antidepressants that are taken in prescription drug form and then there's this uh inflammation piece so could we hypothesize that relief from depression has something to do with neuroplasticity rewiring of neural circuits and that psilocybin we know can encourage neuroplasticity and that perhaps ssris can encourage neuroplasticity in some people not all and that inflammation is a barrier to neuroplasticity to me this is the only thing that can reconcile the the current status of the of the results and then there's ketamine-based therapies and so we have to also kind of set that on the Shelf but let's set that aside on the shelf for now to keep it simple um it seems to me that based on the time course over which ssris work the fact that they increase serotonin uh very quickly but the relief from depression comes much later the fact that neuromodulators like serotonin are intimately involved in neuroplasticity they can in some cases gait neuroplasticity that are all centers back to changing neural circuits and so what we're really trying to do whether or not it's transcranial magnetic stimulation or now we can throw ketamine in there or psilocybin or ssris that treating depression is about rewiring the brain it's not about chemical A or B per se although serotonin seems involved to me what I'd love to see is are more studies about the interaction between neuroplasticity and inflammation and are we seeing that kind of work out there and um because these results sort of sit as disparate somewhat conflicting but it seems like inflammation is is anti-neuroplasticity and broadly speaking here I realize there are many interleukins there are many you know some of which are inflammatory some are which are anti-inflammatory but is that is that a meaningful hypothesis and it um can do you think there's any hope whatsoever to actually cure depression if we if we sort of start to uh unify the the results in these different camps yeah I think it's a completely reasonable hypothesis and I would be broader and I would say honestly the relief of any Neuropsychiatric condition ultimately is from neuroplasticity in some form or another and I think it's worthwhile to step back a bit and talk about what neuroplasticity means uh to date there has been a focus on synapses on the context between neurons as the site of neuroplasticity and that's warranted synapses are plastic they change as a result of experience as a result of hormone changes as a result of exercise as a result of lots of things but synapses are not the be-all and end-all of neural function so for example neurons work by sending electrical signals uh uh along their lengths and and between neurons and interconverting those with chemical signals and the processes of generating those electrical signals the ion channels that are involved that are embedded in membranes that are involved in that are also plastic they can also change as a result of experience that's what we call intrinsic plasticity as opposed to synaptic plasticity in addition there are literal morphological changes so when we we talk about the wiring of the brain sometimes we're talking about literal wiring like cell a wasn't connected to cell b and now it is and that changes and then sometimes well actually cell a was connected to cell b but cell b wasn't responsive enough and now there's a change in cell b so now cell a can fire cell b and that could have been a result of a change in its synapse making it more receptive to another transmitter release from cell a or it could be something intrinsic and cell a that makes it fire its electrical signal its Spike more easily I think that one of the key cell types that's going to be important for your hypothesis um linking inflammation to synaptic plasticity is going to be a cell called a microglial cell and microglial cells are non-neuronal cells in the brain that are motile they can crawl around they have long processes and they can gobble things up they can literally sort of chew away and digest bits of the extracellular scaffolding that surrounds neurons and synapses and thereby renders them plastic they can uh destroy synapses and there is a lot of indication that certain disease States may involve over exuberant microglia pruning synapses to a degree that they shouldn't and we know that microglia are chock-full of cytokine receptors and so are responsive to inflammatory signals when we're talking about inflammation and we're talking about drugs it's worthwhile to mention that there are a lot of Behavioral things that also can influence the signaling so we know and I know you've discussed on your program the incredibly salubrious effects of physical exercise on mental function so exercise is about as good an antidepressant as ssris are and the side effects are only good side effects as opposed to the bad side effects of ssris and again this isn't working through some Airy farrier realm the reason that Exercise Works to relieve depression and the reason that Exercise Works to maintain your cognitive function as you age is because of biological Pathways that we are now uncovering some of which will involve microgl cells and neurons and other types of cells in the brains some of which will involve not the neurons in the brain at all but the brain's vasculature so we know that exercise is very salubrious for keeping blood flowing to the brain and when you're young you have a super abundance of blood flow into your brain so it doesn't matter if it's reduced transiently you're fine but as you get older ah your blood vessels become more occluded and less elastic and you're closer to the to the to the trouble spot and if you exercise regularly you can dilate and make your blood vessels including those in your brain more elastic and that is almost certainly protective against both depression and cognitive decline uh as we age well I am a fan of exercise but I'm fortunate that I enjoy running and some forms of resistance training um so I always assume that the good side effects were just the positive mood effects until the recent literature that as you mentioned uh improved vascular vasculature blood flow and reduced inflammation if not during the exercise when inflammation actually increases decreases inflammation I'm delighted to hear you say the word microglia and um "

            "text": "um there are a bunch of different domains of Mind Body as you um so aptly pointed out it's bi-directional mind informs the body body informs the mind um but we could probably break this down into a respiration so breathing um conscious patterns of breathing emphasizing inhales or emphasizing exhales cyclic hyperventilating Etc could also be thought patterns um a little bit harder to break those down but um many not all but many forms of meditation involve having a very still body not all there's walking meditation Etc but still body um focused mind kind of a not a state that we are in a lot of times unless we direct that state um there are still other mind-body patterns of communication through very still body deep relaxation things like Yoga Nidra non-sleep deep rest there's hypnosis there's um uh touch-based Body Mind communication if we're going to talk about Mind Body also we should refer to as body mind um how do we dive in and think about this because this is involving clearly a thousand different neural Pathways not just the vagus nerve it's you know typically people just kind of hang their hat on Mind Body must be vagus nerve and of course it involves the vagus but the Vegas is an extensive set of Pathways so um how do you like to frame up mind body and what's most intriguing to you about mind-body communication both in terms of the biology and its practical applications well I think just as we talked about how there are two potential Pathways in conveying signals from the body to the mind there are also two potential Pathways at least two potential Pathways it's a conveying signals from the brain to the body and they are the the the neural signals that are conveyed by neurons that actually get there and they are hormones and neurotransmitters and cytokines that are released from the brand I should mention that that hormones are actually produced by neurons including for example some of the hormones that you think about as being produced as sex hormones like estrogen is produced by neurons in your brain for example um so Let me Give an example that I think is a bit out there but I think is really really fascinating and this comes from uh from the cancer world and so uh melanoma is a is a is a bad cancer it kills a lot of people it can spread it's uh highly metastatic and we know that melanomas often become innervated that is to say they become contacted by neurons and wrapped and received signals from them and we also know that if a melanoma becomes innervative then the prognosis for that patient is worse it's more likely to grow it's more likely to spread well how does that happen well recently uh there have been some reports that uh show that neurons that innervate the melanoma don't act directly onto the tumor cells rather what they do is they secrete a signaling molecule that has a receptor on immune cells that are patrolling the edges of the melanoma tumor and nibbling away atoms and they when that signaling molecule is released from the neuron it uh shuts down or reduces that immune patrolling function and then as a consequence the tumor can grow and spread and butt off more readily so this signal that comes from neurons is sending the ambulances home so to speak yeah exactly and the signal is something called calcitonin Gene related peptide or CG RP uh I'm familiar with cgrp from the domain of touch and its involvement in um I think like itch perception perception and its perception right yeah and so all right so if neurons can um can affect the progression of cancer through their activity and these neurons in the periphery are ultimately connected to the brain through a couple of different hops um them is it reasonable to hypothesize that mental processes could affect cancer progression so let's say we have a hypothesis and it's a wild hypothesis and I want to just emphasize that there is not evidence for this but let's make the hypothesis that says that through meditative practice you can slow the progression of certain tumors that tend to get innervated right well right now this is just kind of a wild idea but I think the important thing as I've said before that this is a wild idea with the biological substrate it's not like you meditate and Magic happens and force fields open and the Angels Sing and then your tumor shrinks this is we are saying that activity in certain areas of the brain is increased by this meditative practice and that this sends signals to this neuron and this neuron that actually go to the tumor and make something happen through this biochemical pathway that we have defined right and to me this is speculative but it's also extraordinarily exciting right it opens a kind of Investigation of mind to body signaling that has received very little attention up to now incredible and I say incredible because while you're giving an example of cgrp and nerve innervation and metastatic tumors I absolutely love the idea that phenomenon involving some practice that could be put under the umbrella of Mind Body or Body Mind becomes something entirely different when we're trying to hang that on the hook of a biological process it's like something fundamentally changes there right um you know it's amazing to me for instance that early on psychedelics and breath work conscious breath work were lumped together cost people their jobs at major universities I won't name the universities because we're all you work at one I work at another and there's a third one um called Harvard I guess I just named them um but nowadays their Laboratories at every single one of those institutions studying deliberate respiration on health as well as psychedelics and meditation for that matter with the goal of understanding what cytokines what neurotransmitters Etc change through defined Pathways including vagus but phrenic nerves and frontal cortex and all the stuff that is considered you know classic rigorous Neuroscience so I do think we've entered a new era so it's not costing people their jobs anymore it's actually giving people their jobs and it's federally funded which itself is also fantastic in my opinion so we are in a new era what do you think "

all gonna die sooner or later yes um if you're willing could you tell us the story of how that diagnosis came to be what your initial reaction was and where things stand now and and perhaps we can explore some of the well let's just say pleasant surprises that have emerged since that initial diagnosis well sure I'd be happy to uh so in the uh the summer of 2020 uh in the dark days of covid when

work very effectively there's enough time to recharge before the next beat comes now it turns out that there is a very straightforward therapy for this uh atrial fibrillation comes from uh electrical signaling in the heart sort of swirling about in a circle and and reactivating part of a heart muscle faster than it should and so if you thread through a catheter in your in your in your in your groin up uh up through blood vessels you can put in a little needle and use that to cauterize and to ablate a tiny little strip of cells in the heart that will produce a barrier that will prevent that aberrance return of electrical activity and will cure atrial fibrillation so I have that process that ablation surgery and sure enough it it cured my atrial fibrillation and I was feeling terrific and they said oh as a follow-up come back a few months later and we'll do an echocardiogram to see how your heart looks and they did and they went oh my God there's this huge mass pressing against your heart it's like the size of a Coke can uh here's what we think it is we think it's a hiatal hernia we think your stomach has poked up through the diaphragm muscle and it's nestling next to your heart so the way we diagnose this it's kind of humorous they say chug this can of Dr Pepper and then quickly get up on the table and we'll do the echocardiogram and in the echocardiogram we can see a signature of the popping CO2 bubbles in your soda and if we see those in the mass then we know it's your stomach so I did it I chunked it I got up there oh no it's not your stomach I said oh okay well what we think this is a Teratoma and a Teratoma is a developmental uh anomaly that you carry usually from fetal life where there's a group of different cells that gets in a place where it shouldn't during development and then grows you've probably heard about people who sometimes get like a a tooth that grows hair in their abdomen Sometimes women have these around their ovaries and they're not malignant they don't spread it's a fairly easy thing but I have this enormous Coke can pressing on my heart it may have we don't know have been the source of my atrial fibrillation to start with but in order to deal with this I had to have open heart surgery so I had the surgery and it was a big hairy deal I was told would last about five hours it turns out it lasted two days wow um they had me on the heart lung bypass machine longer than you're supposed to because you're very likely to throw a clot and get a stroke fortunately that didn't happen I I had very skilled surgeons at Johns Hopkins it was bleeding so much that they couldn't close the chest so they had to do all the surgery and then just leave me anesthetized with my chest open until the bleeding stopped and they go so the surgery was a bear and then I'm waiting to get the pathology report back on the tissue they removed and it came back and it was bad news sorry it's not a Teratoma it's not benign it is a kind of cancer called synovial sarcoma and synovial sarcoma is a moderately rare cancer and it usually affects the synovium which is the lining of the joints or some other places it's pretty rare to have it happen in the heart there are a few examples if you look in the biomedical literature for common cancers like testicular cancer or breast cancer there are huge tables of statistics for millions of patients on what's been tried and what works and what the prognosis is for synovial sarcoma of the heart their only individual case reports oh there's a guy in Kenya and he got in this what happened there's there's a woman in Minnesota and this is what happened with her right there are no statistics because because it's that rare and and and the oncologist out well I think you've got 6 to 18 months to live now this was about uh now 27 months ago so I've fortunately uh exceeded that lifespan estimate and I think we got to be clear also that you know being an oncologist has got to be a terrible job for many reasons but one of them is that you got to give a lifespan estimate even if you really don't have the data to do it in a very important you can't just say I won't do it right you got to do it people expect it so you know I'm not saying like oh the oncologist was incompetent because I've outlived my estimate you know he was trying to do something based on very little information made his best guess so um so you know I got this information and I "

I'd like to go longer but that's that's a pretty good run I've gotten to do lots of things in those 61 years and and have wonderful loving interconnected experiences and so the negative part is about what I leave behind certainly what you've left behind is enormous um and has been the consequence of actions long before your diagnosis which I think is a is a clear lesson to everyone um I can't speak for you but don't wait for the diagnosis um you've mentioned the sense of agency that you felt by being able to pay attention to and explore your experience of let's call it what it is impending death and at the same time you as you mentioned you've Amplified and accelerated the number of things that you've put into the world recently writing incredible articles about your experience of life and death and we will of course link to those so people can read them um I've read them all and they are uh profound and they don't just feel important they clearly are important um so very few people have uh your insight into the nervous system at the mechanistic level but also at this more holistic level that um you've clearly displayed to us here and in your research and in your book writing and public speaking um you know I think it's a it's a risky thing to ask somebody for advice um but I can't help myself because um I think it's a it's a real opportunity um if you had advice um to give to any and all of us um based on the whole experience yeah uh all of it from go as they say right um if if you're willing and feel free to pass but if you're willing um what is your advice well I would say the advice that is really Universal is what everybody already knows and is a bit trite but I'll say it anyway and that is appreciate what you got while you got it and you know this isn't any big secret and everyone knows it I would say for a subset of people the way of the nerd is very empowering I don't think that's the case for everyone I think for a subset of people who are deeply curious as their nature turning that Curiosity to your own mortality in your own medical situation can be empowering and and useful but I don't think that should be broad advice I think that's only for a fraction of people it's probably the worst thing they could do and there's nothing wrong with that everybody's everybody's different right not everyone should adopt the way of the nerd but for a fraction of people it's a really really good thing to do this is normally the portion of a conversation with a guest where I list off the many many things they've done and how grateful I am and all of that is absolutely true in the case of you being here today and the work you've done but I think it's self-evident how much you've uh don't just accomplish but how much knowledge you put into the world and not just scientific knowledge but knowledge about The Human Experience of others and of yourself and so I just want to extend a giant thank you on behalf of the listeners and viewers and myself thank you for coming here today thank you for doing what you do and um so great to still have you here and to have this conversation and I hope it goes longer and no matter when it ends you've done an enormous service to humanity well thank you that's very kind it's been it's been a pure pleasure to have this discussion with you thanks David thank you for joining me today for this "

    "episode_summary": "In this episode, my guest is Dr. David Linden, Ph.D., professor of neuroscience at Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine and the author of many popular books about the brain. We discuss individual differences between people \u2014 focusing on differences in how people sense the world around them and the roles that chance, heredity, and life experiences (even in utero) play in determining our physical and cognitive traits. We discuss the bidirectional connection between the mind and body and how our thoughts and mental practices (e.g., meditation and breathwork) impact our health. We also discuss the link between inflammation and depression. We also discuss Dr. Linden\u2019s terminal illness diagnosis, his mindset during chemotherapy and what his diagnosis has taught him about the mind, gratitude, time perception and life. This episode also covers sensual touch, cerebellar function, and epigenetic inheritance and ought to be of interest to all interested in neuroscience, genetics, psychology and human development.\u00a0\nFor the full show notes, including articles, books, and other resources, visit hubermanlab.com.\nTake our survey and get 2 months of Huberman Lab Premium\nThank you to our sponsors\nAG1: https://drinkag1.com/huberman\nROKA: https://roka.com/huberman\nLevels: https://levels.link/huberman\nInsideTracker: https://insidetracker.com/huberman\nSupplements from Momentous\nhttps://www.livemomentous.com/huberman"
