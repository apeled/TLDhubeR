neurobiology\nand ophthalmologyat Stanford School of Medicine.Today is an Ask Me\nAnything episode, or AMA.This is part of our\npremium subscriber channel.Our premium subscriber\nchannel was started in orderto provide support for\nthe standard Huberman Labpodcast, which comes\nout every Mondayand is available at\nzero cost to everybodyon all standard feeds--YouTube, Apple,\nSpotify, and elsewhere.We also started the\npremium channel as a wayto generate support for exciting\nresearch being done at Stanfordand elsewhere, research\non human beings thatleads to important\ndiscoveries thatassist mental health, physical\nhealth, and performance.I'm also pleased to inform\nyou that for every dollarthe Huberman Lab Premium channel\ngenerates for research studies,the Tiny Foundation has\nagreed to match that amount,so now we are able to double\nthe total amount of fundinggiven to studies of mental\nhealth, physical health,and human performance.If you'd like to subscribe\nto the Huberman Lab podcastpremium channel, please go\nto hubermanlab.com/premium.It is $10 a month to subscribe,\nor you can pay $100 all at onceto get an entire 12-month\nsubscription for a year.We also have a lifetime\nsubscription model that isa one-time payment, and again,\nyou can find that optionat hubermanlab.com/premium.For those of you that\nare already subscribersto the Premium channel, please\ngo to hubermanlab.com/premiumand download the Premium\nsubscription feed.And for those of you that\nare not Huberman Lab podcastpremium subscribers,\nyou can stillhear the first 20 minutes\nof today's episodeand determine whether or not\nbecoming a premium subscriberis for you.So without further\nado, let's getto answering your questions.The first question is about the\npros and cons of daily caffeineconsumption.The question reads, what is\nyour opinion on the net benefitof daily caffeine consumption?And how can somebody determine\nif daily caffeine consumptionis right for them?Well, first of all, I did an\nentire episode about caffeine.You can find that by\ngoing to hubermanlab.com.At that website, you can put\nin caffeine into the searchfunction, and you'll find\nlinks to that episodein all the formats--YouTube, Apple,\nSpotify, et cetera.And it's timestamped, of course.You can navigate to\nthe particular topicsmost of interest to you.However, for sake\nof this discussion,I can summarize a few\nof the key points.The most important\nthing to understandis that for most adults--so that is people about\nage 18 to 20 and older--daily caffeine\nconsumption is notgoing to be a problem provided\nit does not induce anxiety,and certainly provided that\nit not induce anxiety or panicattacks, and provided\nthat it does notdisrupt your nighttime sleep.This is why I always\nrecommend that if youare going to consume caffeine\nin any form, coffee, tea, soda,or otherwise, that you\ntry not to ingest caffeinewithin the eight and\nideally within the 10or even 12 hours\nprior to bedtime.That's because the\nhalf life of caffeineis such that even\nif you are able to,for instance, have\na cup of coffeearound 3:00 PM or\n4:00 PM and thenfall asleep around midnight,\nthe architecture of the sleepthat you get is going\nto be disrupted.For instance, it\nis very importantthat you get sufficient amounts\nof both slow wave deep sleepas well as rapid eye\nmovement sleep each night.And if you consume caffeine\ntoo close to bedtime--and here, I'm defining to close\nas anywhere from 8 to 12 hoursbefore going to sleep--chances are you're not going to\nget as much rapid eye movementsleep or slow wave sleep\nthat you would otherwise.And it is the amount of\nrapid eye movement sleepand slow wave sleep\nthat, together,lead to whether or not you\nfeel you had a good night'ssleep in terms of your next\nday alertness and cognitiveabilities.Now, again, some people\nmay find that theycan drink caffeine in the late\nafternoon, maybe even at night,and still fall asleep.But I promise you, even if\nyou're in that category,you will sleep far better,\nmeaning the architectureof your sleep will\nbe better, and youwill feel far more\nrested the next dayif you abstain from caffeine\nwithin the eight to 12 hoursprior to bedtime.And I should also say that\nnone of us are perfect,myself included.I will sometimes have a cup of\ncoffee in the late afternoon,and sometimes that will cause me\nto stay up a little bit later.Sometimes it won't.I don't think you want\nto obsess or worrytoo much about having\nsome caffeine every oncein a while in the\nlate afternoon if youare still able to\nfall asleep, but don'tmake it a regular habit.Now, as far as we know,\nthere is no drawbackto consuming caffeine\non a daily basis,again, provided it does not\ndisrupt your nighttime sleepand provided that does\nnot induce anxiety.In fact, most of\nthe world consumescaffeine every single day.The current estimates\nare that 90%--that's right, 9-0, 90%--of adults throughout the world\nconsume a caffeinated beverageevery single day.That's a staggeringly\nhigh number,making caffeine the most\npopular drug on the planet.In fact, because of the\nway that caffeine works--and just to remind\nyou how it works--it effectively blocks\nadenosine receptors.Adenosine is a molecule\nthat builds up in your brainand body more and more according\nto how long you've been awake.It makes you feel sleepy.Caffeine blocks the\nadenosine receptor,and then when it is dislodged\nfrom that receptor, whateveradenosine has built up\nand is around can thenbind to the adenosine receptor.It makes you feel very sleepy.That's the caffeine crash.So if 90% of the adult\npopulation of the planet Earthis consuming caffeine\nevery day, thatmeans 90% of the adult\npopulation of planet Earthis blocking their\nadenosine receptorsfor some portion of\ntheir daily life,and then their adenosine is\nbinding to the vacant receptoronce the caffeine has dislodged.And why are 90% of adult humans\nconsuming caffeine every day?Well, to feel more\nenergized, more focused,to have more both cognitive\nenergy and physical energy.Now, of course, most people are\nnot walking around thinking,oh, caffeine gives me more\nenergy more focus, et cetera.Most people are consuming\ncaffeine every single dayand are consuming caffeine\nevery single day in orderto feel, quote,\nunquote, normal, to beat their baseline level\nof cognitive ability,and physical energy, and so on.In fact, if you look at the data\non caffeine consumption, whatyou'll find is that\ncaffeine actuallyis a cognitive enhancer.It can improve\nlearning and memory.It can increase physical energy.It can increase mental\nand physical stamina.But a feature of those studies\nthat's not often discussedbut that was, however, discussed\nin the full episode on caffeineis that studies of\ncaffeine typicallyare done by taking\nchronic caffeine usersand then having them abstain\nfrom caffeine for some periodof time, usually four days\nto two weeks, in which timethey undergo\ncaffeine withdrawal.They do not feel well.They get foggy headed.They have less energy.There's some malaise, sometimes\neven some mild depression.And then what they\ndo is they havepeople take caffeine, and\ntake a cognitive exam,or do some physical activity\nand compare their performanceto what it was when they\nwere in the withdrawal state.Another typical form\nof study on caffeineis to take people who\nare naive to caffeineor who never take caffeine, and\nthen have them ingest caffeine,and then measure their cognitive\nand/or physical performance.And in both cases,\nyou see improvements.What I'm saying here is that\ndaily caffeine consumptionis not going to\nlead to improvementsin cognitive ability\nor improvementsin physical ability\nabove one's baselineunless you either\nabstain from caffeinefor some period of time,\ntypically four days to twoweeks prior, or you\nare not somebodywho typically ingests caffeine.In other words, 90% of\nthe world's populationis drinking caffeine\non a daily basisto be at their normal level\nof mental and physicalfunctioning.So the question was,\nis there a net benefitto daily caffeine consumption?And here I can\nreliably say, providedyou don't suffer from anxiety\nattacks or lack of sleepfrom the caffeine consumption,\nprovided that you'remindful of not ingesting\ncaffeine too late in the day,there doesn't seem to be any big\ndrawback to drinking caffeineon a daily basis.However, there doesn't seem\nto be any great benefit,at least in terms\nof direct effectson cognitive or\nphysical ability.So I realize this is a little\nbit of a convoluted answer,but we have to be honest\nwith one another here.Caffeine is a\nperformance-enhancing drug,but only when compared to\nthe noncaffeinated state.And 90% of the adult population\nof the world is caffeinated.So adding more caffeine above\nwhat you would normally consumeis certainly not going to allow\nyou to think better and performbetter physically.Here's a useful way to\nthink about caffeine.Most people can pretty well\ntolerate doses of caffeine,anywhere from 100 milligrams\nto 300 milligrams.It depends on body\nweight and dependson your tolerance,\ntolerance, of course,based on how familiar you are\nwith the effects of caffeineand how regularly\nyou consume it.A typical cup of coffee, which,\nby the way, does not exist.Depending on the\nvendor, dependingon how much water-to-coffee\nratio one uses,depending on whether or not it's\nFrench press or it's pour over,the type of coffee,\net cetera, all of thatis going to determine the\ntotal amount of caffeinein that coffee.But we can set some outer bounds\non the total amount of caffeinethat likely exists\nin a cup of coffee,and it's probably somewhere\nbetween 100 milligrams--that would be on the weaker side\nfor a six or eight ounce cupof coffee--out to about 300 milligrams\nfor the equivalentsix to eight ounces of coffee.But if you were to brew your\ncoffee very, very strongor, like me, occasionally throw\na shot of espresso in there,too, you could\nget that number upto 400 or 500\nmilligrams of caffeine.I personally tolerate\ncaffeine pretty well.I've been drinking caffeine\nsince I was a teenager, mostlyin the form of brewed\nunflavored yerba mate tea.It's important to stay away from\nthe smoked varieties of yerbamate if you're going to get your\ncaffeine from your yerba mate.The smoked varieties\ncan be carcinogenic.The nonsmoked varieties don't\nseem to have that property.But there's a lot of\ncaffeine in yerba mate,so I'll drink yerba mate and\nhave for many, many years.Or I'll drink black coffee,\nor espresso, or espressoamericano, things of that sort.That's my preferred\nsource of caffeine.Most people are drinking\ncoffee to get their caffeineand, I would say\nthat, if you aregoing to drink your\ncaffeine, drink itin the early part of the\nday, as I mentioned earlier.I am a big proponent of\ndelaying your first caffeineintake until at least 90\nminutes after waking in orderto avoid the afternoon crash.I've talked a lot about\nthis on the podcast.There are a lot of clips\non the internet explainingthe rationale behind that.And if you do experience an\nafternoon crash in energy,I do recommend delaying your\nmorning caffeine intake to 90to 120 minutes after waking.Now, for people that\nwant to get moreof a true cognitive-enhancing\nand performance-enhancingeffect from caffeine,\nagain, you'regoing to have to abstain from\ncaffeine for about four days.For regular caffeine drinkers,\nthat's going to be difficult.That is going to\nlead to headaches.That's going to\nlead to brain fog.That's going to lead\nto feelings of malaise.In fact, the last time\nI took four days offor even a week off from\ncaffeine consumptionwas when I was sick.I don't get sick very\noften, but when I am sick,I generally abstain\nfrom caffeine.And sometimes I\nwonder whether or notthe malaise I feel from whatever\nviral or bacterial thingI might be dealing\nwith when I'm sickis, in part, the malaise\nof caffeine withdrawal.I certainly notice I\nfeel much better whenI return to drinking\ncaffeine, but thattends to coincide\nwith feeling relieffrom whatever sinus symptoms\nand other symptoms Imight have been experiencing\nfrom the illness.So it's not a good experiment.I can't tease apart\nthose variables.So the short answer\nis, for most adults,there does not seem to be any\nmajor downside to consumingcaffeine.And there have been scattered\nreports here and therein humans, showing that\ningesting caffeine can increasedopamine receptors,\nwhich will effectivelyallow you to get more out of\nthe dopamine that you produce.This is why caffeine has\na mood elevating as wellas energy-elevating effect.I should point out that some\npeople just cannot toleratecaffeine.It makes them too\njittery, too anxious.They start sweating.They get heart palpitations.It's very hard for these\npeople to build up a toleranceto caffeine that allows\nthem to enjoy it.These are the\npeople that can evenfeel a fluttering of the\nheart and a lot of energyleft from decaf\ncoffee, somethingthat, to me, is just a foreign.Concept but some people are\njust that sensitive to caffeinethat even the small amounts of\ncaffeine in chocolate or decafcoffee make them feel too alert.And they should\nabstain from caffeine.I don't think they\nare, in any way,harming their health by\nabstaining from caffeine.Then there's the issue of\nchildren, and adolescents,and teenagers, and young\nadults ingesting caffeine.And I covered some of this in\nthe episode about caffeine,but there's been a\nlot of debate as towhether or not caffeine\ncan cause osteoporosis,whether or not it can leach\ncalcium out of the bones,whether or not can stunt growth.Frankly, there's not\na lot of evidencefor those sorts of claims,\nand yet the developing brainis a very tender and\nmalleable environment.And somebody who\nstarted off his careeras a developmental\nneurobiologist,studying developmental\nbrain plasticity and wiring,it does sort of make me cringe\nto think about children youngerthan the age of,\nsay, 14 ingestinglarge amounts of caffeine in\nany form-- soda, coffee, tea, etcetera.Despite the fact that\nthere's very little evidencethat it can stunt their\ngrowth, I don't personallylike the idea of the\nyoung brain being bathedin an adenosine receptor\nantagonist, which iseffectively what caffeine is.As much as possible, one\nwants the developing brainto develop in a milieu of\nunencumbered, nonchemicallyencumbered interactions\nbetween neurotransmittersand their receptors,\nunless, of course,there's a clinical need\nfor a prescription drug,or a supplement, or\nsome modificationof a nutritional\nprogram specificallyto up or down regulate\nthe dopamine systemor up or down regulate\nthe serotonin system.But those are the\nsorts of decisionsthat really should be\nmade in close oversightand recommendations\nby a psychiatrist.So the short answer around\ndaily caffeine consumptionin young people,\nmeaning 14 and younger,is avoid it if you can.Have your children avoid\ncaffeine if they can.The occasional bit of\ncaffeine is probably notgoing to be a problem.The amount of caffeine in small\namounts of chocolate, probablynot going to be a problem.But caffeine in the form of\nenergy drinks, sodas, coffee,tea for children\nyounger than 14 justseems like a bad\nidea from everythingwe understand about brain wiring\nand the trajectories of brainsthat develop with a lot\nof chemical adjustmentfrom other sources,\nlike caffeine.Now, for kids age 15 to, say,\n18 or 20, a lot of brain wiringis still occurring, but a\nlot of it has been completed.So probably not as risky\nto consume caffeineevery once in a while or\nmaybe even on a daily basis.But there are two--I think there are\ngreat advantagesto limiting the amount of\ncaffeine that one ingests.And of course, in the\nadolescent and teen years,nowadays a lot of\nkids are consumingenergy drinks and soda.And some of those\nenergy drinks and sodoes contain a lot\nof caffeine, anywherefrom 200 to 800\nmilligrams of caffeine.And nowadays, more\nsodas and energy drinkscontain other things like\namino acid precursorsto neuromodulators,\nlike dopamine.So for instance, a\nlot of energy drinksnow contain L-tyrosine, which\nis a precursor to dopamine.A lot of them will\ncontain L-theanine.I've talked about L-theanine\nas a supplement thatcan promote more\nrestful sleep if taken30 to 60 minutes before sleep.The reason why a lot of\nenergy drinks, and sodas,and, frankly, now coffee\nbrands are including theaninein the coffee, or\nenergy drink, or sodais because it tends to have a\nmild anxiety-reducing effect.And it reduces the jitters\nthat caffeine creates.And so that's actually a trick\nthat these companies are usingin order to get people to\ningest more caffeine because,by including the theanine, it's\npreventing the kid or adultfrom feeling too jittery.And therefore, they can\ncontinue to consume that drinkwithout feeling like\nthey're overstimulated.So if I were to take the\nparental neuroscientist adultvoice here, I would say\navoid caffeine intakeas much as you can until\nyou're about 18 years old.But I'm realistic.I realize that adolescents\nand teens age, say,14, or 15, out to\n18, and older aregoing to be consuming caffeine\nin the form of energy drinksand sodas.But reducing the total\namount of caffeinethat one is ingesting\nin those years,it just seems\nreally advantageous,again, m all the same\nreasons I mentioned earlier.You don't want the\nyoung brain bathingin a bunch of exogenous,\nmeaning externally introducedneurochemicals or in things\nlike theanine or L-tyrosine.If you're going to indulge\nin caffeine, or in energydrinks, or theanine, or\nL-tyrosine, for that matter,that's the sort of thing\nthat probably is best leftfor people 18 and older.And even there, if one finds\nthat caffeine is for them,as do I, I think always best\nto try and get your caffeinefrom a clean source,\na clean source meaningsomething that contains\njust coffee or just tea.Again, this isn't a knock on\nenergy drink specifically,but you really have to make\nsure that whatever energydrink you're going to consume,\nyou know what's in it.You recognize what the\ndifferent ingredients do.And you recognize the\npotential of ingestingthose ingredients chronically\nover and over again.And I've talked to a\nlittle bit about thison previous podcasts,\nand I'll get into this.Again, maybe we'll do an entire\nepisode about energy drinksbecause they are so\ncommonly consumed nowadays.Now, getting back to\nthe original questionabout daily caffeine\nconsumption,this person goes on to\nsay that, for them--OK, this is their\npersonal experience--after a few weeks of\nconsumption of daily caffeine,the negatives start to\noutweigh the positive ones.They're getting\npoor-quality sleep,lack of appetite,\nanxiety, et cetera.And when they don't\nconsume caffeine,they find it a lot\neasier to be mindful,and their meditation\npractice is much better.But they're lethargic\nand less motivated.So what they're describing\nare all the classic symptomsof caffeine overuse, probably\nnot abuse in this case,although caffeine\ncan be truly abused,people taking caffeine pills,\net cetera in large quantities.We're not talking about that.But this person is describing\nthe classic patternof overuse of caffeine and the\nclassic pattern of withdrawalfrom caffeine when\nthey stop taking it.So what should\nsomebody like this do?And I think that's\nan important questionto answer because I\nthink a lot of peoplefall into this category.They drink caffeine every day.They're no longer getting the\nperformance-enhancing effectof caffeine, so\nthey're taking it justto be normal or feel like they\ncan focus normally and havenormal amounts of energy.But then if they try and\ncome off, they feel worse.There are a couple\nof ways to do this.You can taper your\ncaffeine intake offover the course of\nfour to seven days.But most people don't\nhave the disciplineor don't want to spend\nthe time doing that.But if you want to, the way\nyou would do that is youwould cut it by about\n10% or 15% per day.You could do that\nby volume, or youcould do that by concentration\nof coffee, that sort of thing.A simpler way to go about all\nthis that still will allowyou to get some of the\nperformance-enhancing effectsof caffeine and yet\nexperience far less withdrawalwould be two things.First of all, just\nhalve your amountof caffeine intake\nfor two or three days.So again, that\ncould be by volume,or it could be by\nconcentration, probably easiestto do by volume.And so instead of\ndrinking an eight ouncecoffee in the morning,\nmaybe you do four ouncesof regular coffee,\nfour ounces of decaf,or you just have the\nfour ounces of coffee.You do that for\nthree or four days,and then you take perhaps one\nfull day off from caffeine,maybe another full day off.You're going to feel a\nlot less bad on thosetwo days, having cut your\ncaffeine intake in halfin the previous four\ndays then you wouldif you just went cold turkey.And then you go back\nto ingesting caffeine,but you go back to ingesting\ncaffeine at that 50% doseor what used to represent that\n50% dose of caffeine for you.And you just continue\nthat way on a daily basis,and then every once\nin a while, whenyou want the\nperformance-enhancing effectsof caffeine, you go back to what\nwas your original dose, whichis now double what you're\ntaking on a daily basis.So what we're really\ntalking about hereis not going cold turkey.We're not talking about\nquitting caffeine indefinitely.What we're talking about is\ncutting the amount of caffeinethat you drink in half for about\nfour days, plus or minus a day,and then taking two days off\nfrom caffeine completely.And then going back on that half\ndose of caffeine indefinitely.That's your new baseline\nof caffeine intake.And then every once\nin a while, if youneed a bit more of a lift, you\ningest twice as much caffeineor a coffee that's\ntwice as concentrated.We should acknowledge\nthat most people aren'tgoing to be really precise\nabout the amount of ouncesand the amount of caffeine.Nonetheless, it's\npretty straightforwardto know that you're reducing\nyour caffeine intake.Certainly, it's clear\nto know if you'reingesting no caffeine\nfor a couple of days.And it's pretty clear\nwhen you're doublingthe amount of caffeine.But you don't have to worry\nso much that you're exactlydoubling the amount of caffeine.You can drink one\nand a half timesas much as you happen to\ndrink on the day before,or you could drink\nthree times as much.You would definitely feel it if\nyou drink three times as much.One very important\nthing to recognizeis that, on any day where you\nreally spike your caffeineintake above baseline, no\nmatter where that baseline iswhen you start-- it could be 0.It could be 400 milligrams.It could be 200 milligrams.When you double that intake, you\nwill get a big boost of energy,and the next day, you're going\nto feel the crash from that.You're going to\nfeel more lethargic.You're going to\nfeel not so good.This has to do with dopamine\nreceptor modulation.This has to do with adenosine\nreceptor modulation.The important thing\nto do is not continueto consume that elevated\nlevel of caffeine, whichis what most people do, and then\nthey set a new hire baselinejust to feel normal.The key thing is to just manage\nto get through that crash day,manage to get\nthrough that one daywhere you feel a little less\ngood or maybe even down a bit.Get outside a bit.Get some more sunshine.We know that spikes your\ncortisol in a good way.It can increase the\ncatecholamines, dopamine, etcetera.Get a little bit more sunlight.Get a little bit more movement.Get outside.Do something to offset\nthose feelings of malaise,and then get right back\nto your original goallevel of caffeine each day.There's no use in getting so\nquantitative that you makeyour life miserable,\nyou're measuring things outlike a laboratory chemist.If you're that type and you\nwant to do that, be my guest.But unless you're taking\ncaffeine in pill form,it's very, very hard\nto get extremely exactabout the amounts of caffeine\nthat you're ingesting.So it is OK to eyeball it,\nbut understand the contourof how caffeine works\nand what the caffeineperformance-enhancing\neffect comes from.It comes from a caffeine\nintake above baseline.Understand that any time\nyou go above baselinewith your caffeine\nintake, there'sthe potential of some anxiety.Understand that there's going\nto be a slight withdrawaleffect that lasts\nabout 24 to 48 hours.Battle through\nthat short period,and you'll be right\nback where you startedand where you need to be so\nthat you can enjoy caffeineon a daily basis and derive\nthe benefits because there aremany benefits to drinking\ncaffeine and avoidingsome of the potential hazards.And again, if you're\na young person,I recommend delaying that\ncaffeine intake maybe, Idon't know, 10 years.Thank you for joining\nfor the beginningof this Ask Me Anything episode.To hear the full episode and to\nhear future episodes of theseAsk Me Anything sessions plus\nto receive transcripts of themand transcripts of the Huberman\nLab podcast standard channeland premium tools not\nreleased anywhere else,please go to\nhubermanlab.com/premium.Just to remind you why we\nlaunched the Huberman Labpodcast premium channel,\nit's really twofold.First of all, it's to raise\nsupport for the standardHuberman Lab podcast\nchannel, which, of course,will still be continued to be\nreleased every Monday in fulllength-- we are not going to\nchange the format or anythingabout the standard\nHuberman Lab podcast--and to fund research, in\nparticular research doneon human beings, so not animal\nmodels but on human beings,which I think we all\nagree is a speciesthat we are most interested in.And we are going to\nspecifically fundresearch that is aimed toward\ndeveloping further protocolsfor mental health, physical\nhealth, and performance,and those protocols\nwill be distributedthrough all channels, not\njust the premium channelbut through all channels,\nHuberman Lab podcastand other media channels.So the idea here is to give\nyou information to your burningquestions in depth and\nallow you the opportunityto support the kind\nof research thatprovides those kinds of\nanswers in the first place.Now, an especially exciting\nfeature of the premium channelis that the Tiny\nFoundation has generouslyoffered to do dollar-for-dollar\nmatch on all funds raisedfor research through\nthe premium channel.So this is a terrific\nway that they'regoing to amplify whatever funds\ncome in through the premiumchannel to further support\nresearch for scienceand science-related tools for\nmental health, physical health,and performance.If you'd like to sign up for the\nHuberman Lab Premium channel,again, there's a cost\nof $10 per month,or you can pay $100 up\nfront for the entire year.That will give you\naccess to all the AMAs.You can ask questions and get\nanswers to your questions,and you'll, of course, get\nanswers to all the questionsthat other people ask as well.There will also be some premium\ncontent, such as transcriptsof the AMAs and various\ntranscripts and protocolsof Huberman Lab podcast\nepisodes not found elsewhere.And again, you'll be\nsupporting researchfor mental health, physical\nhealth, and performance.You can sign up for the\npremium channel by goingto hubermanlab.com/premium.Again, that's\nhubermanlab.com/premium.And as always, thank you for\nyour interest in
