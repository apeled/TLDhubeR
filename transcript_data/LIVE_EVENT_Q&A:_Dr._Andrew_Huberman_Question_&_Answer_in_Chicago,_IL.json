            "text": "ANDREW HUBERMAN: Welcome to\nthe Huberman Lab podcast,where we discuss science\nand science-based toolsfor everyday life.[MUSIC PLAYING]Recently, the Huberman\nLab hosted a live eventat The Chicago Theater\nin Chicago, Illinois.The event consisted of a\nlecture entitled \"The Brain BodyContract\" followed by a\nquestion and answer session.We wanted to make sure that the\nquestion and answer session wasavailable to\neverybody, regardlessof who could attend in person.I also want to\nmake sure to thankthe sponsors of that event,\nwhich were AG1 and Eight Sleep.Eight Sleep makes smart mattress\ncovers with cooling, heating,and sleep tracking capacity.One of the key things to\ngetting a great night's sleepis to make sure that the\ntemperature of your sleepingenvironment is\ncorrect, and that'sbecause in order to fall\nand stay deeply asleep,your body temperature\nactually has to dropby about 1 to 3 degrees.And in order to wake up feeling\nrefreshed and energized,your body temperature\nactually hasto increase by about\n1 to 3 degrees.With Eight Sleep, you can\nprogram the temperatureof your sleeping environment\nin the beginning, middle,and end of your night.It has a number\nof other features,like tracking the amount\nof rapid eye movementand slow wave\nsleep that you get,things that are essential\nto really dialingin the perfect\nnight's sleep for you.I've been sleeping on\nan Eight Sleep mattresscover for well\nover two years now,and it has greatly\nimproved my sleep.I fall asleep far more quickly,\nI wake up far less oftenin the middle of the\nnight, and I wake upfeeling far more\nrefreshed than I everdid prior to using an\nEight Sleep mattress cover.If you'd like to\ntry Eight Sleep,you can go to eightsleep.com to\nsave $150 off their pod threecover.Eight Sleep currently\nships to the USA,Canada, UK, select countries\nin the EU, and Australia.Again, that's\neightsleep.com/huberman.AG1 is an all in one vitamin\nmineral probiotic drink.I've been taking AG1\nsince 2012, so I'mdelighted that they\nsponsored the live event.The reason I started\ntaking AG1, and the reasonI still drink AG1\nonce or twice a day,is that it provides all of my\nfoundational nutritional needs.That is, it provides\ninsurance that Iget the proper amounts of those\nvitamins, minerals, probioticsand fiber to ensure optimal\nmental health, physicalhealth, and performance.If you'd like to try AG1, you\ncan go to drinkAG1.com/hubermanto claim a special offer.They're giving away five free\ntravel packs, plus a year'ssupply of vitamin D3 K2.Again, that's\ndrinkAG1.com/huberman to claimthat special offer.And now, without further ado,\nthe question and answer sessionfrom our live event\nat The ChicagoTheater in Chicago, Illinois.[MUSIC PLAYING]I turn 70 soon.What is your best advice to keep\nmy brain healthy in old age?"

            "text": "Terrific question.The advice I would give to you,\nas somebody about to reach 70,is the same advice\nI give to anybody,which is that, essentially,\nall of the things that improvecardiovascular\nhealth and perfusionof your bodily tissues are\ngoing to improve functionalityof the brain.Because, of course, the brain\nis a rich consumer of fuel,requires very good portals\nto deliver those fuels,and the capillaries, micro\ncapillaries and arteries,and so forth, need to\nbe clean and clear.That's the big one.This is why I think\nthe prescription nowis that's generally\naccepted, and here I'mborrowing from my friend\nPeter Attia, but about 150,or maybe as much as 200 minutes\nof so-called zone 2 cardioper week, movement that you\ncan just barely carry outa conversation, is\ngoing to be very useful.One thing that's\noften not discussedis that load bearing\nexercise of some sortis going to be better, provided\nyour body can tolerate it,but you should do something\nthat you can do consistentlyover those long durations\nwithout injuring yourself.But there's a very\ninteresting literatureabout how load bearing\nmovements actuallygenerate the\nrelease of hormones,yes, hormones, from\nbone that actuallycross the blood-brain\nbarrier and may influencehealth of neurons in brain\nareas such as the hippocampus.And there, I'm extending from\npreclinical data in animalsto humans, but there's\nsome human data startingto emerge that that's true.It's also true, and there's\na wonderful paper outjust today or yesterday\nfrom Dr. Andy Galpin's laband collaborators\ntalking about howif you look at\ncognitive health, it'shighly correlated with things\nthat relate to strength.And that is not to say\nthat you should justdo strength training\nexercises but weknow that all people,\ntruly all people,should be doing some sort\nof resistance trainingtwo or three times per week.You know, and we know that\ngrip strength and increasingasymmetry in grip strength\nbetween the two handsis one of the indicators\nof deficits in controlfrom the brain out\nto the periphery,and it's correlated\nwith cognitive decline.There's also some\ninteresting dataabout how when the feet become\nfloppy and kind of flaccidor the lack of ability\nto extend one's toes.I'm still working, I've been\nwearing this toe spreaderthing.Has anyone tried those?Those hurt.Those hurt.I broke this foot\na bunch of times.but I'll tell you when you get\nbetter at spreading your toes,it's really exciting.And it's really exciting\nfor several reasons.It's really exciting\nbecause there'smore stability in your feet.You can run and move and do\nthings better without pain.But in addition to that,\nbelieve it or not, just as oneof the first things\nthat they're goingto do when you come\ninto this worldis scrape the bottom\nof your foot and lookfor the Babinski reflex,\nwhich is a neural transmissionreflex, as all reflexes\nare, but it's testing,essentially, the health\nof the nervous system.That over time, again,\nthere are many correlatesof dementia, many, many\ncorrelates of dementia,but an inability to finely\ncontrol the extremitiesis certainly one of them.So strength training,\ncardiovascular training, theseare kind of stereotyped\nanswers for your questionand, yet, those are\nreally the prime moversagainst cardiovascular and\ncerebrovascular disease.And then, of course,\nI'd be remissif I didn't throw in something\nthat was a little bit moreedgy because that's what I do.There are interesting\ndata about the useof drugs to increase\nacetylcholine transmission,right?I mean, I was visiting a\nNobel Prize winner at Columbiato learn about his incredible\nwork some years agoand saw that he chewed\nno fewer than five piecesof Nicorette gum, something\nI don't recommend,during this short meeting.And I said, what\nis this all about?And he said, well, you\nknow, I don't smoke anymorebecause I don't\nwant lung cancer.But he said nicotine\nis protective againstParkinson's and Alzheimer's.I was like, how can that be?And he said, well, you know,\ndecreases in neuromodulation,dopamine, acetylcholine\ncorrelatedwith cognitive decline,\nkeeping your brain sharp,and so on and so forth.So I'm not encouraging\npeople to take nicotine.It increases blood\npressure, vasoconstriction,but it's an interesting\nconsiderationsome of the emerging cholinergic\nand dopaminergic drugs are waysto increase acetylcholine\nand dopamineare certainly intriguing.And I won't tell you\nwho that person isbut his name is Richard Axel.Next question.Yeah.How can I optimize sleep\nwhile working 24/7 hourshifts as a firefighter,\n24 hours on 48 hours off?"

            "text": "OK.And this probably also\npertains to new parents,and it probably also\npertains to anyonethat's going through a\nparticularly stressful time,where you're micro waking\nthroughout the night, so notjust firefighters.So what do we know?We know, based on\nreally good data,that shift work is bad for us.It's just bad.We're a diurnal species.We're not nocturnal.But thank you, thank you,\nthank you, shift workers,because you essentially\nkeep us all safeand make the world go round.And so we need you, and\nwe want you healthy.So one of the main\nthings is that youcan make sure that you stay on\nthe same sleep-wake schedule,excuse me, for at\nleast two weeks.It's the swing shift\nthat's really the worst.You can tell your\nboss I said that.And if they won't\nagree, and you'redoing this 24 hour\non 24 hour off,there are a couple of things\nthat are really important.First of all, the main way to\nwake up your nervous system,even though it might not\nfeel like a triple espressois going to be that light\nexposure to the eyes.And if you can't\nget it from sunlightis going to be from any\nbright, artificial light.I'm not a huge proponent\nof the daylight simulators.They're very expensive.You can simply buy a 900 lux\nled far more inexpensively.I don't have any\nrelationship to any companythat sells these but you\ncan find them on Amazonor wherever you happen to\nprefer to purchase things.Or you can just get really\nclose to a bright light.Anytime you're\ntrying to wake up,even if you don't feel\nthat it helps you wake upvery much, mostly\nfor the melatoninsuppression, because\nbright light will veryacutely suppress melatonin.And then the real\nquestion from shiftworkersalways seems to be,\nshould I catch up on sleepor is that going\nto be problematic?Should I just stay up\ninto the next cycle?And the answer there is\na little bit nuanced,but the best answer I\ncan give across the boardis, if this is a\npattern that you'regoing to be in regularly,\nover say months or years,then get whatever sleep you can.Get whatever sleep you can.If it's something that you're\ndoing somewhat acutely,like you're traveling to\nEurope and you're justgoing to force yourself to\nstay up a day and a halfthen, in that case,\nI would say, no needto get the maximum\namount of sleep.Just try and stay with\nthe local schedule.We have an entire\nepisode about shift workthat somehow maybe didn't\nget as much recognitionas it should have\nfor shift workers,and we'll try and get\nit out in better form.We don't always succeed\nin top carding thingsin a way that gets them\nout to the most people.One thing I will say\nis an opportunityto announce that our\nwebsite, hubermanlab.com, iscompletely revamped so\nit's highly searchable.It will take you to\nexact timestamps,and now you can segregate out\ntimestamps from newsletters,from all this stuff.So thanks to a lot of\neffort by my amazing team,you can now navigate that\nsite to real precision.So if you want to say\nADHD, Adderall, kids, yes,no, for instance,\nit will take youto precise timestamps that\nwill address those issues.Next question, please.How does hypnosis therapy work?"

            "text": "Well, this is a very\ninteresting topic to mebecause my colleague,\nAssociate Chair of Psychiatryat Stanford, David Spiegel,\nis a world expert in hypnosisand its neural\nunderpinnings and its usefor clinical applications.His father was a hypnotist,\nalso a psychiatrist.And when people hear hypnotism,\nthey think of stage hypnotismand being up on stage and\ndoing things you don't want toin front of other people.But really, it's\nwhen we're talkingabout clinical\napplications or wellnessapplications of\nhypnosis, we're talkingabout self-directed hypnosis.I really wish there\nwas a better name,because I don't think\nhypnosis is goingto advance very far as a field,\nfrankly, because everyonethinks hypnosis.And it would be\nlike if psychedelicswere just called drugs, right?We were taught in the\n80s that drugs are bad,and that your brain on\ndrugs looks like an omelet,and that's bad.And if you like omelets,\nthey're still bad.And drugs of abuse are bad.And, actually, I hope\nwe can talk brieflyabout psychedelics\nat some point,because I do think\nthere's a little bitof a runaway train around the\ntopic of psychedelics now.I think we need to be\nvery careful how weapproach that entire landscape.But hypnosis essentially\nworks by allowing someoneto place their own brain\ninto this very unique state.Earlier, we were talking\nabout neuroplasticity,and we talked about the fact\nthat neuroplasticity involvesintense focus followed by deep\nrest in the form of deep sleepor non-sleep deep rest, maybe\neven Rick Rubining it and justkind of like laying there.Hypnosis is different\nbecause hypnosisis a state in which your\nfocus is very narrow,the context is very narrow,\nbut you're very, very relaxed.So maybe the Rubin example of\nbeing brain active and bodyvery still is a bit more\nlike hypnosis, to be fair.Why would it be the case that\nDavid Spiegel and his dadhave literally a tool that is\napproved by the PsychiatricAssociation, the major American\nPsychiatric Association,where they can figure\nout how hypnotizableyou are by having look\nup and try and closeyour eyelids while\ncontinuing to look up,the so-called Spiegel\neye roll test.Sounds pretty wacky, right?This is like TikTok level wacky.Well, the reason is you\nhave cranial nerves,so they sit more or less\nnear your neck, thatallow you to direct your\nfocus, your eyes, upward,and then you have cranial nerves\nthat have your eyes go downand the ones that the cranial\nnerves that drive your eyes upare associated with\nalertness and eyes open.No surprise.And the cranial nerves\nthat are associatedwith pointing your eyes down\nand closing your eyelidsare associated with, what,\nwith drowsiness, sleep,and lack of alertness.There's sort of a push-pull in\nthe autonomic nervous system.And Spiegel, Spiegel's\ndaddy and him,figured out, because\nthey're geniuses,that if somebody\ncan maintain upwardgaze while closing their\neyelids, two things happen.One, you'll see the\nwhites of their eyes,and it's pretty creepy.Two, that means they're\nhighly hypnotizable,because that is a reflection\nof the probabilitythat they can enter a\nbrain state in which theyare both very awake\nand very relaxed.Pretty cool.Now, if that sounds\nkind of wacky,because you're just\nlooking at the periphery,keep in mind, that one\nof the primary entrypoints for diagnosing concussion\nis to shine a light in one eyeand have that pupil\nconstrict and thensee whether or not the\nother pupil constricts,the so-called consensual\npupillary reflex.Although, technically,\nand I've been botheredby this from day\none, it should becalled the non-consensual\npupil reflex,because the other eye doesn't\nhave a choice if everything'sworking.[AUDIENCE LAUGHING]In any case, if you have\na hard hit to the head,you'll see that you shine\nlight in one eye, the pupilconstricts, and the other\none stays really dilated.And then you go, OK, get this\nperson to the emergency roombecause there's been a\nsevering of the connectionsbetween the two\nsides of the brain.So looking in the\neyes and tryingto deduce what might be\nhappening more centrallywithin the caverns of\nthe skull and the brainis not a new thing.It is a primary diagnostic\ntool in neurology.It's also how your parents\nknew that you were taking drugswhen you came in the door\nbecause your pupils werelike that big, and that\nreflects a differencein autonomic arousal.And, basically, stimulants,\nas, most dilate their pupils.This is also why the story\nabout belladonna, peopleintentionally\ndilating their pupilsto trick people into\nthinking that theywere attracted to them.I've thought about\nthis one a lot, too.It's like not a precursor\nto good relationship.It's like someone's\nusing their physiologyto pretend that\nthey're attractedso the other person thinks that\nthey're attracted so that theymight become attracted.Anyway, it's a recipe for\nfailure, almost as badas most of the dating apps.Well, I wouldn't know.I'm not one them,\nbut from what I hear.OK.So where were we?Hypnosis.When you are in a state\nof elevated attentionbut very relaxed, guess\nwhat, neuroplasticityoccurs much faster\nbecause you're essentiallymarrying the two states\nthat are normally divorced,which are heightened\nlevels of attentionfirst and then deep rest.You're essentially putting the\nnervous system into a more,I wouldn't call it hypoplastic\nstate, but a more plasticstate.And for people that are\nhighly hypnotizable,the success rates at, for\ninstance, smoking cessation,pain relief, are\npretty impressive.Spiegel Lab has published\na number of these.So I think self hypnosis\nis a very interesting tool.I just hope that\nthey rename it sothat it stands a chance\nof getting off the ground.I mean, one of the\nthings that youlearn as a public\nfacing educatoris that what things are\ncalled has a great impact onwhether or not they achieve\nany kind of use in the world.Hence, why I decided to swallow\nthe difficult pill of partiallyrenaming yoga nidra as\nnon-sleep deep rest.I don't like to do that.Yoga nidra has more\nthan 1,000 year history.But when people hear yoga\nnidra, unless they are very openminded, they hear magic carpet.They hear levitation,\nand it's unfortunate,and that's not how I feel.But for years, I talked about\nyoga nidra, it's so cool.It's like a sleep state but\nit's-- they're like, yeah,like yoga nidra.OK.But if you come from a culture\nwhere that's discussed,they're all about it.And so non-sleep deep rest, you\nknow, I felt like, all right,leave my name out of it.You know, I'll be\ndead eventually.I mean, I'm in this\nline of advisors, right?I'm like approaching 50.I'm like, I'm winning\nin my lineage.But should I be fortunate enough\nto live past bullet canceror car crash far enough, then\nNSDR hopefully will persist,and I don't need a piece of it.It's just the hope\nis that peoplewill learn to put themselves\ninto brain states thatcan be adaptive for\nthem so it'd be niceif someone could come up with\nsomething other than hypnosis.I think Spiegel would agree.Super interested in\npsychedelics as medicineto be done with somebody\nwith experience."

            "text": "Worried about unlocking\nmental health conditions.Yeah.You should be.What does the research say,\nand what are your thoughts?OK.Barbed wire question,\nwe like that.Psychedelics, well, let's\njust back up a little bitand acknowledge one\nthing that's moreimportant than\npsychedelics or anythingelse when it comes to\nrewiring the brain, whichis that, ultimately, rewiring\nof the brain is about shiftsin neuromodulators, dopamine,\nserotonin, epinephrine,norepinephrine, acetylcholine.And it's no coincidence that\nSSRIs, Selective SerotoninReuptake Inhibitors, have\nbeen one of the major entrypoints for attempts to\ntreat things like depressionover the last 20-30\nyears or more.When I was in college, that's\nwhen the book Listeningto Prozac came out.But prior to that,\nthere's a long historyof drugs, prescription\ndrugs, in that case,to change levels\nof neuromodulators,like serotonin or\nacetylcholine or dopamine,in an attempt to cure\nor treat a disease.But keep in mind, despite\nthe varied success of SSRIs,a topic unto itself, that\nthere's a strong belief,and there has been\nfor a long time, that,if SSRIs worked it wasn't\nbecause the depressed brain isdeficient in\nserotonin, but ratherbecause increasing serotonin\noffered the opportunityto increase neuroplasticity.So there's a different\nway of thinking about it,and that's a segue for saying\nthat when you say psychedelics,that's a broad\ncategory of drugs.Nowadays, people even\nlump ketamine into that.Although, technically,\nit's not a psychedelic.But the sort of\nclassic, if you will,psychedelics are LSD,\nLysergic Acid Diethylamide,and psilocybin, aka mushrooms.Although, it comes in\nother sources, as well.The major effect\nof psilocybin isto stimulate a\nparticular serotoninreceptor which has elevated\ndensity in particular brainareas.And indeed, there are many\nrecent clinical trials, many,let's say 12 to 20 good\nsized clinical trials donein diverse locations on the\nplanet, many at Johns Hopkinsand UCSF, some in Switzerland,\nshowing that enhancing,and here you'll notice I'm\nusing the mechanistic language,enhancing the transmission\nof the release of serotoninand activating particular\nserotonin receptorsleads to an opportunity for\nmore, what, neuroplasticity.Now, I say it that way not\nto add a bunch of word soupbut because the real\nquestion is whether or notthe experience\nthat one has whileunder the influence\nof psychedelicsis critical to the\nclinical outcome.Or a growing idea,\njust as a hypothesis,I think is equally\ninteresting isthat it's the serotonin itself\nand that the things you see,the things you hear, the\nthings you experienceare not relevant.Now, I have some experience\nwith psychedelics.I had a bad time on\npsychedelics as a teenager.I was also pretty wayward youth.But I've had a bad trip on LSD.For years, I was scared\nthat people were goingto dose me with LSD after that.It was so bad.I think across the board, we\ncan say, kids doing psychedelicsjust seems like a bad idea.Their brains are\nalready hypoplastic.If you have a predisposition\nto bipolar typeissues or schizophrenia, it\ncan exacerbate those issues.And, certainly, if you\ndon't have adequate support,in the form of somebody that can\nguide you through the sessions,as well as the\npresessions, which are notdone with psychedelics, as well\nas the so-called integrationafterwards, it can be a\nreally slippery slope.I know examples of\npeople really sufferingin the aftermath of\npsychedelic journeys.Now, there are a few\ninteresting points, as well,and it wouldn't be fair if\nI didn't say that several,if not many,\nindividuals who havehad so-called treatment\nresistant depression, at leastin these clinical\ntrials, have reportedfeeling far better after\npsilocybin therapy,but that psilocybin therapy was\ndone with several presessions,then the psychedelic sessions\nthen several after sessions.And it's not always the case\nthat things turn out well.So I think it's early days.What is interesting,\nand I think important,is to recognize that psilocybin\nand the structure of psilocybinis very similar to serotonin\nitself, very similar,but it activates\nparticular receptors.A lot of people don't realize\nhow similar to serotonin it is,and that microdosing\npsilocybin, Ishould say the\ndata on microdosingpsilocybin, something\nthat's increasingly popular,is not particularly compelling.It's not clear what it does.It's not clear if\nit's of any use.And I think the danger here is\nthat we end up in a situationas we did with,\nfrankly, with cannabis.And, by the way,\nI'm not somebodywho demonizes cannabis.I think it has its uses\nfor certain people,but very high THC\nconcentration cannabiscan be a problem, especially\nwith people that havea predisposition to psychosis.And anyone that tells you\nthat cannabis isn't addictive,just say, great, don't\nsmoke weed for a week.Let's see how you do.Yeah.And let's go on a\nplane trip together.And how are you sleeping?And so I think the chronic\ncannabis users are startingto take note of some of\nthe issues it causes but,again, there are some\nclinical applications.Now, when it comes to the\nhigh speed train psychedelics,like DMT, that's far less\ndata available there.And then MDMA,\nassisted psychotherapyfor the treatment\nof PTSD, there,the data I think\nare more robust,and I think we're likely\nto see legalizationor at least decriminalization\nin the next few years.But keep in mind that MDMA is\nmethylenedioxymethamphetamine.So for people that like\ndopaminergic states,it's a particularly\ncompelling stateto be in, so much so that they\ncould overindulge in MDMA,and then there's the\nissues of purity,and I could do a five hour\npodcast on this right now.So I think the important point\nis approach with caution.Kids, absolutely not.And I think it's an exciting\nlandscape, very exciting,and whereas a\ndiscussion like the onewe just had would have gotten\nme fired a few years ago.I mean, Stanford has\nbig programs now,a lot of philanthropy,\nfederal grants,and many laboratories focused\non the study of psychedelics.So I would say stay tuned.But keep in mind that increasing\nneuromodulator levels veryacutely, whether or not it's\nwith a prescription drugor whether or not it's\nwith psychedelics,is really what lies at\nthe heart of the recovery,the potential\nrecovery, I should say,or the negative\neffects that happento occur in anyone that embarks\non the psychedelic journey.Do people who meditate and\nneed less sleep than people whodon't?Oh, that's interesting.Well, we know that from a study\nby Wendy Suzuki, who I believe,if NYU made the\nright choice, and Ithink they did is, now the Dean\nof Arts and Sciences at NYU.She ran a memory\nlab for a long time.She has data showing\nthat even 10, Ithink it's 13, but as little\nas 10 minutes of meditation,so it'll be sitting\nstill, breathing,focusing on your breathing,\ndirecting one's attentionto third eye center, et cetera.We don't have a third eye.The pineal is thought\nto be the third eye.But I don't know\nwhy people say it'sa light sensitive\ntissue deep in the brainbut maybe that's why they\ncall it the third eye.But, in any case,\nthat type of practicehas been shown to increase\nmemory focus, aka learning,but there's some\ninteresting footnotesin those papers, which\npoint to the factthat when people meditate too\nclose to bedtime, oftentimes,they have trouble sleeping\nbecause, basically, meditationis a focusing exercise.It's a perceptual exercise.I don't think of meditation\nis anything mystical.It's a self-directed shift\nin your perception to,what, to your interoception,\nto your internal state,as opposed to anything beyond\nthe confines of your skin.There's nothing\nmystical about that.And then, in that\nstate, your brainstarts to generate\npatterns of activity thatare distinct from\nwhen you're sharingyour attention between\nwhat's going on internallyand what's happening\nout in the world, right?I think we need to\ndemystify what peoplehave cloaked as mystical.And when I say\ncloaked, I don't thinkthat the people that have\nmeditated for thousandsof years thought that there\nwas anything mystical about itbut, sometimes,\nwhat we experiencethere can feel mystical.So if you have\ntrouble sleeping, Irecommend doing some sort of\nnon-sleep deep rest practice,like NSDR, aka yoga nidra.Although, those are different.NSDR generally lacks\nthe intention piece.And the ones that I've\nput into the world,we've stripped away\nthe intentions,and we've stripped away any kind\nof language that would make youthink that there\nwas some sort of,let's just say, like\ncultural aspect to it,which, again, is admittedly\na bit unfair to the originpractice of yoga nidra.But the problem, again,\nis that in yoga nidra,you're going to be doing\nintentions and hearinglanguage that for\nsome people, not all,might divorce you from\nthe wish to do it.In any case, non-sleep deep\nrest done at any time of day,but especially if\nyou fall asleepin the middle of\nthe night, is goingto be useful for helping\nyou fall back asleep.Whereas meditation,\nagain, is goingto enhance your level of focus.So I don't think\nit's a good practiceif you have trouble sleeping.Now, to finally answer your\nquestion, if you meditate,can you afford to sleep less?My friend, Matt\nWalker, would say no.However, many of us can't\nsleep as much as we want to,and many of us are not like\nMatt, where we can wake upwithout an alarm clock.I'll just keep\nsleeping and sleeping,unless I went to\nbed at like 8:00.This is actually interesting.There's an asymmetry\nto your sleep needs.If you go to bed,\nremember that old adage,every hour before midnight\nis worth two after?Well, it turns out\nthat for peoplethat are meant to be early\nrisers, going to bed at 8:00,you'll wake up at 3:00\nor 4:00 feeling great.You go to bed at\n11:00, you feel groggy,and there are good\nreasons to explain that.But Matt would say that\nneed your sleep, period.I'm more of the camp, based\non my read of the data,And, yes, we are allowed to\ndisagree and still be friends.It's allowed.In fact, Matt's going\nto do a series on sleepwith our podcast,\neven though he hasa terrific podcast of his\nown, where we will maybedebate a little bit of this,\nthat there are ways that youcan at least replace the\nfeeling of wakefulnessthat you would have lost\nif you don't sleep enough.And for me, really,\nthat's why NSDRbecame such an attractive tool\nto do for 10 or 30 minutes eachmorning if I didn't sleep\nenough the night before.I first learned\nabout yoga nidra,actually at addiction recovery\ncenter, trauma recovery centerin Florida in 2017.I have a friend, a super\ntalented trauma therapist,who also treats addiction, that\nI've sent many, many people to,and he has this kind of\nseemingly like wizard abilityto get people who have been\naddicts to not be addicts.And one of the tools he uses\nis yoga nidra every morningfor 30 minutes, and\neventually an hour,which seems like\na lot, but then healso has these people wake\nup very early, maybe an hourbefore they would\nnormally wake up, and gointo that liminal state\nbetween sleep and wakefulness.Now, my experience is that 10 to\n20 minutes of NSDR, yoga nidra,is sufficient to\noffset some sleep lossand allow at least\nme to function,and many people report the same.We have a study going with the\nSleep Laboratory at Stanfordto explore this in more depth.And what I can tell\nyou, because I'minvolved in some\nof this work, isthat there are several military\nunits, because they haveno opportunity to get sleep\nbecause they're working,that have to rely\non tools like thisin order to be able to function\nat their highest level.And I'm sure they will\ntell you, as I will,that they'd prefer to get\n8 to 10 hours of sleep.But, guess what,\nthey can't, and so Ithink that's the important\ntakeaway is that we don't getto pick how much we\nsleep, unless you'regoing to be completely neurotic\nabout your sleep hygiene, whichmakes you kind of a less\ninteresting person in life,is what I'm told.Going to bed at 8:00 is great\nlike some or most of the timebut you got to stay up\nevery once in a while.I mean, after they released\n\"Chimp Empire\" on Netflix,I discovered that NSDR\nis a very valuable tool.And by the way, \"Chimp\nEmpire\" and \"Succession\"have a lot of parallels.And if you watch one, I\ninterleave \"Chimp Empire\",\"Succession\", \"Chimp\nEmpire\", \"Succession\".And you start to realize, like,\nwhoa, like were pretty similar.And then you look at the\nworld differently, I promise.Your podcast has\npositively changedthe lives of so many\npeople, including me,"

            "text": "how has it changed your life?OK.I wasn't expecting that one.Thank you, Samantha.Well, first of all, I mean,\nas this little 11-year-oldtold me.I mean, this is essentially\nwhat I've done my whole life.I'm a fairly private person.Believe it or not, I'm\npretty introverted.I spend a lot of time alone, and\nI think that's required for me.I basically have four modes.Four modes.One, I'm either readying\nmyself through sleep and NSDRto do one of the\nother three modes,maybe there's a fifth mode, or\nI'm in one of these other threemodes, which is I'm either\nforaging for information,organizing that information,\nor dispersing that information,or getting ready to\ndo it all over again.And then, there's this\nrelaxation vacation thingthat they keep telling me about.But then I went to\nItaly, and then like Rickand I like just hung out there,\nand it didn't feel like work.I also discovered some\nreally great podcasts.I don't know, I think\none of the coolestpodcasts out there if you like\nrock and roll, which I love,is A History of 500 Songs by\nAndrew Hickey's podcast on rockand roll.I like the nerdy podcasts.It's like a graduate or an\neducation in rock and roll.It's so cool.And you'll learn a lot\nabout music and historyand the mobs involved\nand all that stuff.And from what I was told, like\nAl Capone used to sit there,right?His exit was there, you\nknow, so it was weird.Right?And then he died of\nsyphilis, and likeso I don't know how I\nfeel about all that,but they told me that.So I think the podcast has been\nwonderful as an opportunityto share things that I love.If I had my way, it\nwould be more like this,although more of a\ndialogue, frankly.It's changed my understanding\nof what the world is like.I certainly get critique,\nand that's good.But, again, I was\nraised by iconoclasts,and particularly my postdoc\nadvisor, Ben Barrus,who unfortunately,\nas I mentioned,is dead because\nI worked for him.But he really encouraged\nall of us in his lab.And often, we were\nvery close friends.I spent the last year\nof his life recordinginterview with him.There's actually a documentary\ncoming out about Ben,and then I'm going to release\nthe audio interviews with Ben,which he approved, by the way.And you'll get to realize that\nthe history of what you seeis often not what the dead\nperson really did or said.It's going to be\nfun, so I can't waittill they release\nthis documentary,and then Ben gets to have\nhis voice infused in it.And it'll be a cool documentary.But, as some of you know, that\nwhat appears to be and what wasand the historical\nnarrative is not necessarilywhat really happened,\nbut that's just life.So I suppose the short answer\nis that I feel very honoredwith the opportunity.Very, very honored.And it's a challenge at times.I suppose the major\nchallenges arewhen things are taken out of\ncontext, like little clips,and things of that sort.Being misunderstood\ndoesn't feel good.But look, at the\nend of the day, Ifeel like the luckiest\nperson in the worldbecause I get to spend\nmy time learning.So it's either I'm\nforaging, I'm organizingor I'm dispersing\ninformation that I also wantand that I find\nincredibly useful.Or if not that, then certainly\ninformative and, at times,enchanting as well.So I try and focus\non the positive,and I have a number of\npractices that help me do that.And I am somebody who\nengages on social media.I'm not a post and\nghost kind of person.I want to understand.I think that cuttlefish\nare super interesting,but human beings are\nsuper interesting too.And I have a strong\ndrive for mastery,but also I do have a\nstrong sense of justice,and that can be\nproblematic at times.I define justice as feeling\nlike there's somethingfor us to do about something.Like seeing something\nthat upsets usor that excites us\nis great, but thenif you have a strong\nsense of justice,you feel like there's something\nyou need to do about it,and not everybody feels that.And then, of course, a\ndesire to understand.And I think, for reasons\nvery personal to me,that relate mostly\nto just havinga kind of incredible array\nof experiences in life,many of which were like\nshocking, disturbing, exciting,enchanting that I\nwant to understand.And so it's changed things,\nbut it's like, I don't know,I got one truck, one watch.Which is not to say that I\ndon't care about having things.There are a few\nthings I really love,but mostly, like I'm just\nthinking about the podcastwe got to record\non Monday which isabout willpower and tenacity.And if I don't stop myself,\nI'll give it right now.So what do you feel\nis the next big thingto come to the forefront\nin the health space?"

            "text": "Thanks for this question.One is non-protein amino acids.I love these debates\nonline because I knowthat there's something there.It's so cool because I grew\nup in seeing these debates,and you know there's\nsomething interesting therebecause people are\ndebating about it.But the debate isn't\nwhat's interesting.It's almost always\nthe thing that peoplearen't talking about that's\nsure to surface at some point.And right now, there's.This obsession with like\nseed oils it's like seed oil.Seed oils.And I can't demonize seed oils.All the data say that\nif you separate outtheir caloric load, there's\nnothing inherently badabout seed oils, and et cetera.I don't know.It's still an\nemerging literature.But there was a scientist at\nStanford, Ed Rubenstein, whopassed away at a ripe old age,\na brilliant scientist, whotalked about, and I had\na lot of discussionswith when I was a postdoc,\nabout non-protein amino acids.It turns out his son is\na neuroscientist at UCSF.His other son is a\nphysician at UCSF.So it's another one of these\nlow performing families.And all wonderful people.And you know, Ed had data\nthat unlike a lot of animals,like birds, there are\ncertain amino acids, whichare non-protein\namino acids, thatexist in fairly high\ndensity in seeds and nuts,which is not to say that\nseeds and nuts are bad.I had almonds this\nevening, so please.But non-protein amino\nacids are similar enoughto mammalian protein amino\nacids that if they are consumedin abundance, and\nperhaps especiallyin liquid form, that\nthey may, again, may,because this is\nabout the future.This isn't about what we know.This is about where\nI think there'sinterest and growing interest.They may be able to incorporate\ninto certain proteinsof our tissues of our\nbody that potentially Edthought could lead to\nmisfolding of those proteinsand may explain certain\nforms of neurodegenerationand other neurocognitive\nchallenges.So I think non-protein\namino acids are goingto be an important discussion.Now, there are lots of\nnon protein amino acidsthat don't come\nfrom foods, but Ithink the discussion around non\nprotein amino acids from foodsis going to be very interesting.So that's one area.The other area, and perhaps you\npicked up on this a little bittonight, is that I like the nuts\nand boltsy stuff around stress,neuroplasticity.But the high level stuff,\nI think the relationshipbetween structured\nthought, abstract thought,I'm not interested in\nthe free will discussion.I just feel like\nthat's a career ender.I'm friends with\nRobert Sapolsky,and he's got a great\nbook coming outabout this called\n\"Determined\", so he obviouslydoesn't believe in free will.But he's far smarter\nthan I ever could be.And it just feels like,\nI don't know that there'san endpoint with that one.But if anyone could\nfind, it would be Robert.He's oh so smart.But I think that the higher\nlevel stuff, creativity,abstract reasoning and\nthought, defining and betterunderstanding the\ndifferent statesthat we can go into in waking.And I confess, without a hint\nof sheepishness about it,that I also think the\nnotion of spiritualityand the belief in\nthings that arebeyond our current and\nconscious understandingis super interesting.I think that as a species we've\nbeen challenged and conflictedfrom go, at least that's what\nthe historical scripture tellsus, and that it's sort of\ninherent to our experiencethat life is challenging and\nperplexing and also wonderful.And so I think a\nbetter understandingof how to navigate all that, I\nmean, this stuff in our skulls,except for the eyes,\nwhich, by the way,are your two pieces\nof brain that are notin your skull, the retinas.I have to point that out.You know, it's tricky, and we're\ntrying to use that very tissueto understand it.And so I'm intrigued\nby the possibilitythat there are certain aspects\nof self that maybe are notintended to be explored\nbecause they are not reallyof us, right?Brains interacting\nwith one anotheris an interesting\narea, certainlyfor scientific\nexploration, but I'mfascinated by and excited\nabout the possibilitythat, at some point, our\nspecies will both understandand the mechanics\nof our emotions,mechanics of our thought\nprocess, creativity, and so on,but that we will also\nallow room for the stuffthat we can't explain with\nscience and to allow roomfor that in our life\nexperience because I alsobelieve that can be powerful.And while understanding\nthings in great detailand putting mechanism\nand utility around thatand applying that\nis wonderful, it'sthe stuff of my life,\nwhich is obvious,I also think that there's\ngreat value in nottrying to control and\nunderstand everythingand enjoying the\nmystery of things thatare clearly greater than us.[APPLAUSE]How do you balance\nhaving fun with havingsuch a rich knowledge and\npassion in neuroscienceand optimization?Fun.People ask me, like\nwhat do you do for fun?I think people think I\ndo all the protocols.It's like, sure, I get my\nsunlight, I drink my water.I do.I do them.But fun, I like learning.I like learning.I do enjoy physical movement.I like learning.For me, OK, so like for\nme, it's the little things.I don't know, maybe I'm weird.Certainly, I've been told that.The other day, there was a\nfrog in my swimming pool,and he was just like\nsitting there like.And I just like spent some time\nlooking at him back and forth,and then I had all sorts of\nideas about what's he doing?And what's he thinking?And then I was thinking\nhow Oliver Sacks usedto spend time imagining\nexperiencing life as a batthrough only echolocation.He talked about this.And I thought, and\nwhy would he do that?Right?And that's kind of cute.He's like delightful\nold man, right?He had a 600 pounds free weight\nsquat, won the state Californiasquatting championship but also\nliked pretending he was a bat.He's a weird dude.Did methamphetamines,\nraced motorcycles,hung out with movie stars, but\nthen also was like a recluseand liked rocks.OK, that's a weird scientist.Been around a lot of those.But in discussions with\npeople that knew him,I mean, that exercise of like\nseeing something he thoughtwas cool like a bat allowed\nhim to also use theory of mindto kind of think,\nwhat would it belike to have locked\nin syndrome and onlybe able to blink your\neyes to communicate?And gave him an incredible\ncompassion and sensitivityfor other people that\nthen he transmutedinto the form of\nthese wonderful books.So for me, fun is really\nabout doing the thingsthat I do\nsystematically each day,but then when\nsomething excites me.I know that feeling.I know it physically in my body.And to just follow that\ntrail like a weirdo, right?Like a weirdo, just\nlike Barrus was weirdand Barbara Chapman was weird.And like, I think\neverybody's a little weirdif you allow yourself to\njust see the things that youthink are really cool.And there are a bunch\nof things that Ithink are really\ncool that enchant methat a bunch of other\npeople love too.And I know that because I see\nwe're all watching that videoor something like that.But I think for me,\nfun is in the practiceof trying to stay open to\nlike the little things.The little things that\nkids say are alwaysdelightful because\nthey're not filteringthrough all the bullshit\nthat we filter our lifeexperience through.But also just, yeah, I\nlike reading and learning,exercising.I mean, I like to think I'm\nnot a very wooden person.But, at the same time, I mean,\nI didn't see the \"Barbie\" movie.No disrespect to Barbie.I go to movies.I do that kind of thing.I don't know what\nelse is there to do?At some point, you know,\nwhat else is there to do?Anyway, I mean, I delight\nin certain things,as you now know\nfar too much about.But fun is a relative term.That was a hard question.[AUDIENCE LAUGHING & APPLAUDING]Thank you.Thanks for the pass.Thanks for that.Do you believe time
