            "text": "word emergency because in preparing for our discussion today it occurred to me that in this uh list of roles that uh your title assumes that scientific information on how to improve health comes first then you mentioned emergency so what I'd like to talk about first is Health not lack of Health but Health you know so often we hear about um the Mental Health crisis but what we're really talking about is the lack of Mental Health crisis AKA mental illness and rarely do we hear for instance what constitutes mental health we hear what constitutes mental illness whereas in the domain of physical health there's a lot of information out there about how to be more physically healthy cardiovascular exercise resistance exercise yoga typee exercise Mobility Etc and of course some people have physical health ailments and there's a lot of information in terms of how to deal with that as well but what I would like to know before we get into the long list of issues that uh our nation confronts um everything from obesity to food additives to mental health issues what is going well in other words in the last let's say five 5 to 10 years have there been any areas of physical health and mental health Improvement in the US at large that we can attribute to some of the public health initiatives uh directly so that's a really good question and let me just also say about the very first point you raised that you're absolutely right that we have operated primarily through an illness frame when we look at health and in my mind that's only one half of the equation right so when we are talking about physical illness for example uh you know as a doctor I learned how to diagnose and treat someone with diabetes or with high blood pressure or with coronary heart disease but we also know that even if I don't have diabetes or coronary heart disease uh or high blood pressure even if I don't have any diagnosable medical condition I may not be at an optimal level of physical health right I may not be able to for example walk around the block without getting shorter breath I may not be able to play with my kids because my physical fitness and stamina is is insufficient I may not be able to lift my luggage when I go to the airport because I don't have enough strength in my body yet I wouldn't have a diagnosable mental illness so I think it's easier to understand there with physical health that we're not just aiming for lack of illness we're aiming to optimize our physical health the same is true with mental health and I think when we talk about mental health people think we're just the sole goal here is to prevent diagnosable mental illness that is one goal to both prevent and to manage uh mental illness when it arises but we also need to recognize there's a whole other half of the spectrum where there people who may not have diagnosable mental illness but are not operating optimally in their lives and that's detracting from their fulfillment from their functionality like in not just at work but also in their communities and in their families and so I think part of the conversation that that I want us to have as a country is about how to optimize mental health and well-being and that is includes preventing Mental Illness but it is much broader and bigger uh than that alone great yeah I think it's so important that we recognize that um treating disease is critical obviously but that there's a lot that can be done to improve one's Health even in the absence of any known disease and um and you've got all these officers these incredible Physicians and uh nurses and uh people at uh your disposal I My Hope Is that they would also be accessible for and currently carrying out um efforts to transmit information to people about hey here are the things that you can do every day every week every month in order to make your life as as healthy as possible um as well as you know rushing in under conditions of you know Public Health crisis yeah it's a good good point and it's certainly you know many of our officers do focus on this broader rubric around well-being but it's part of how we need I think the the broader health system and public health system to operate even outside of government and this I think will require significant change and shift in how we think about our jobs like when I went to medical school the vast majority of the focus was on diagnosing and treating illness it was much much less focused on thinking about how to enhance well-being and when you ask talk to people in their lives it becomes clear that they want to do more than just prevent diagnosable illness they they want to be able to walk their their child down the aisle they want and have the endurance to do that they want to be able to uh be independent often and carry their groceries or carry their luggage um this is why I think we've got to broaden our focus in in public health and look when I came into this role um by the way I was not expecting to serve "

            "text": "in government this was not part of some 5 10 30 year plan uh when I was a a kid I was interested in medicine but I always thought I was going to practice medicine you know like my dad did and like my like the clinic my mom ran you know set up put up a shing sing Le see patients and uh be a primary care doctor and and feel good about the work I was doing but what happened to me along the way is uh you know I I trained in medicine I got interested in technology spent seven years building a technology company uh that was focused on health I got I was I became increasingly worried about the way we were delivering Healthcare and it felt like our healthare system was broken people who needed care couldn't get it it was often too expensive to get care we were focusing on treatment solely and not enough on prevention so I started getting involved in in advocating for a Better Health Care system with doctors around the country when despite all that I still never thought I would work in government but in 2013 uh is when President Obama's team had reached out to me and asked if I'd be interested in considering the position of Surgeon General and what was interesting to me about this position is it's actually very different from most positions uh that are appointed by President and government and that it's supposed to be an independent position so my agenda the issues I choose to take on are not determined by a president or a party they're determined by science and the public interest uh and that's what's what guides me you know and that's what that's what guided me in that first term when I served and when President Biden asked me to come back and serve as Surgeon General a second time that's what's guided me here too um so Biden um is not sending you notes saying hey could you put some effort into uh you know getting messages out about you know Co or could you put more effort into um getting your team over to Maui to deal with the you know the you know the tragedy there and which is a long Arc tragedy right we get the news in a in a in a blast of this happened and then the next blast comes in about something else and we forget that there are physical and mental health crises that are ongoing um and and then I have to imagine then start to overlap with one another or is it so is it your decision um where and how to deploy the financial and and Human Resources like okay we're going to put 10 people on Maui yeah we're going to um put uh you know five people in the Central States you know going around talking to um major organizations about what they need to do to prepare for this winter is that how it works or are you getting memos and um in other words who's your boss everyone has a boss at some level mine are is are the listeners of of this podcast at some level I work for them it used to also be my bulldog um but my my boss my wife and my two kids who are five and seven they I do what they tell me to got it got it so um but how we make our decisions in the office actually it's a bit different uh with those two roles so on with with the second one with overseeing the commission Corp our 6,000 officers they the the decisions about how and when we deploy officers are collaborative right so I you know we work with other colleagues throughout the Department of Health and Human Services we work with people in FEMA across the administration but we also work with States so sometimes states often often States will put in a request and say hey we need support here uh can you help so we'll work with colleagues across our department to say okay well we can mobilize our commission core officers what assets can you mobilize and then collectively we will send a team out there so for example we have officers helping in Maui right now uh particularly with mental health needs uh which are I worry only going to continue to grow over the weeks and months ahead on the other side of the house when when it comes to deciding which issues we engage with the public on like in this case mental health has been a big Focus uh area for me on on that front well we certainly you know are open to suggestions from the public members of Congress sometimes say hey can you help the public understand about this issue you know a lot of people have ideas and opinions but the decision about which issues to focus on those are our offices uh and to me that's important because part of the reason over time I believe the public came to have some degree of faith and trust in the office office is because they hope that the office was functioning the way you hope your doctor is functioning which is being an independent source of information for you uh and a source that has your best interest at heart that's not being pulled aside by political interests or by other agendas but the primary agenda is how can I help your health and so for me like we have to make an independent assessment there and say okay where is the need uh the greatest tier where can we make the biggest difference sometimes we may not build an initiative on an issue and that doesn't mean that that ISU is not important or that it's not affecting a lot of people but we have to make hard decisions about where to put limited resources and so when I was a Surgeon General the the first time one of the big areas I focused on was the opioid crisis uh that we were dealing with as well as the E ecigarette use among youth because we were seeing a dramatic increase uh among kids in ecigarette use that was can I just ask you sorry to interrupt but I think it's relevant here um has that increase continued or ecigarette use AKA vaping yeah yeah so we still see unfortunately there there's been some improvements but we still see way too many kids who are using uh vaping devices early on and part of what we did from our office is recognizing that we actually issued the first Federal report on ecigarettes and youth uh we call the country's attention to the fact that this is a crisis we worked with members of Congress uh to talk about the kind of action we needed uh from a legislative and Regulatory perspective and worked with colleagues at the FDA and in government as well but there are two things that are really most important in guiding our choice about priorities uh one is data we look at what the numbers actually tell us about the impact these issues are having on the population as well as the trajectory of Rise if something's getting dramatically worse and people don't realize it might be an area for us to focus but the other critical factor is what I hear from people on the road so I try to spend as much time as I can visiting communities across the country doing Town Halls meeting with uh community members and just trying to frankly just listen to what's on their mind and that's where I actually get a lot of information as well that tell like that's actually how I came to focus on the issue of loneliness and isolation it wasn't because it popped up in a report uh as being uh the the leading public health issue in the country it was because everywhere I was going in 2014 2015 whether I was talking to college students talking to retired Americans talking to parents in rural areas and urban areas I kept hearing these stories about people who felt like they were on their own or they felt invisible or they felt if they disappeared tomorrow no one would even care or they felt like they just didn't belong and it's heartbreaking to hear that from anyone it's particularly heartbreaking to hear it from kids uh who you hope are entering life and looking forward to what comes uh but many kids weren't feeling that way that is very useful context and we will get back to the isolation um crisis "

            "text": "um such an important initiative that that um I just will thank you now for having put out the the message on social media and elsewhere um about that um because I think one of the questions I have in light of what you just said is it's clear that you got your ear to the ground you're talking to different people um it's also critically important that people hear from you and know um not just what's happening but that you perhaps want to know what uh you know where the issues lie and what the um what the actionable steps are that people can take right and I think that we now live in a hyperconnected world um so you know in fact I'll just say that one of the reasons I launched this podcast is in 2020 I was going on podcast talking about things like maintaining sleep and circadian rhythm and stuff from my lab related to trying to um adjust anxiety under under conditions where I think everyone was anxious and sleep rhythms were disrupted Etc um and I was somewhat surprised that that I didn't get a warning on my phone hey make sure you're getting morning sunlight you know like I I'll get a flood warning uh you know I'll get a warning that I might get a warning but it's only a test warning I'll get three of those yesterday living here near the coast but um I don't think once during the pandemic did I get a email or a public service announcement saying hey you know if you are going to be indoors a lot you're going to have to be mindful of maintaining your circadian rhythm because if you're not I we know based on hundreds of studies now that drifts and circadian rhythmicity are a precursor to mental health issues I mean in fact there's a new idea that many not all suicides um are preceded by a period of disrupted sleep which is you know kind of makes sense in in um and it's not uh causal of course but how come during the pandemic we each and all as US citizens did not get an email or a text message saying hey these are five things that you need to do every day to try and stay as stable as possible in this very uncertain landscape that we're in well it's a really good question and and I think it's a it's a reasonable and a very good suggestion to say that hey look there should be a clear and comprehensive way that we can get messages out to everyone um like if we were working in a hospital system and there was a safety issue that came up there would be an email sent to all the hospital staff members saying hey this is something you need to be aware of right so I think it's a reasonable expectation uh practically if you go back though over the last 20 30 years for on a on health issues there hasn't been sort of an agency or an entity that has sent emails out to everyone first of all how to send an email out to everyone in America is not a simple proposition either technically it's challenging there's some legal issues you'd have to deal with as well but you could do a night where you go CNN Fox NBC ABC New York Times Wall Street like you could hit the right the the right wi the left wing and everything yeah that's a really interesting suggest like one but one one video just where they all agree like hey this is important information so a apolitical like no yeah so I would say that that kind of messaging I would say through traditional media certainly has happened you know and it happened during coid uh it happened for example when um you know during the first year of coid I was a private citizen you know in the private private Administration but I you know I watched both then and at the beginning of the the Biden Administration um many officials would go out in front of cameras and say here are three things you need to do to keep yourself safe uh you know from from coid as and that was a big question people had how do I keep myself safe okay here are three things you can do a couple of challenges I would say here is that number one even if you hit all the major Network and cable news shows you're still not reaching everyone right because we're living in a in a society where increasingly people are not watching TV right they're getting their news from other sources um the other thing uh that's important to know is that attention shifts quickly you know in traditional media also from issue to issue and so you might get a clip you know out at a certain uh day or you might get on all the Sunday shows for example but the next day you know that message isn't necessarily there you know it's it's gone and people's attention has also switched off too so there were I mean I can count and you know we've logged probably thousands of interviews at this point that we've done with mainstream media with sort of you know concise messages about three things you can do to protect yourself Etc and you know I'm glad we did those we got to do them but I think one of the things we they don't we don't have right now in the country and this is an I think a bit of an Health infrastructure challenge is we actually don't have a quick efficient way to reach everyone in the country with a health message just like what you you said you know what if you wanted to get that message about three things to protect yourself from let's say coid or three things to do to you know support your health and well-being during a time of Crisis or during a time of Health I mean again like not just the flood warning but the the the daily because I I do think that most of mental and physical health is the result of daily practices that are you know that build on themselves sort of like compounding compounded Investments and then of course there are acute challenges and chronic challenges that people face but things of that sort too I I I think those kind of messages in time of Health are are absolutely important as well and uh you know I think I think in the sort of I think fast-paced crisis-driven environment that we live in uh unfortunately people are often less are paying less attention to those maintenance and Improvement messages than they are to managing the crisis messages but I think that they're equally as important but I do think that what you're pointing out is an infrastructure piece that that needs to be built which is a way for uh you know Health authorities to reach people you know with information quickly and comprehensively uh I'll just tell you that in the 1980s when C ever coup was Surgeon General one thing that he had done done which was interesting is he had actually sent a letter a physical letter uh to all households in America about HIV a physical letter a physical letter some of our listeners won't know what that is yeah so thing you read about in the history books or something shows up in your mailbox and you open it and um hopefully something you want to read this Cas this case he was worried about HIV about the fact that people didn't know about it so he worked through an with as I understand it with a member of Congress found you know a way to do this from a funding perspective but it was a very unusual move uh and one that was never replicated since and there was never infrastructure or funding to do that again um when I was Surge General last time you know you know some years ago and then this time around one of the things I did do is I was able ble to send a physical letter to the medical community uh the first time it was about the opioid use crisis and about changing our prescribing practices in medicine so that we expose fewer patients to the harm of opioids while making sure people who needed them actually got them and the second time it was about coid Therapeutics it was about making sure that when we had data about medicines that actually work like paid that we may actually offered them to patients made them available to patients because we were realizing that many people weren't getting offered life-saving medic iations even though they were in high risk groups um so we were able to find you know and we had to again there two had to sort of creatively Cobble together resources funding this is all sort of you know sort of behind the scenes government stuff but the the bottom line is in in what you want in an emergency uh and what you want I think in the long term is a simple clear comprehensive way that public health messages can get out to people and to this day what we still have to rely on are one traditional channels like you know traditional media to cover the initiatives we put out whether it's on social media and youth mental health or on loneliness or on youth mental health more broadly uh we will have to rely on online channels uh which which we do as well or we have to look to creative Partnerships that we build with people who reach different audiences and then together uh we try to get out messages our office does all three uh of these but uh it's a patchwork uh and and you know and it's not always ideal but it's what we do now I think part of what this reflects is a broader challenge like in "

that you asked uh folks to submit questions and it was really excited to see how many people actually wrote in uh but I think it's also just a testament to how you've done such an incredible job building a channel to the public to let people know about these topics that you know that are so vital to our health and well-being whether it's sleep or physical activity or mental health uh and so I just want to thank you for all the work you're doing trying to help people understand more about health and clearly the fact that that folks are engaging they're sending questions and they're sending

reason we do it I mean I love learning and teaching but um that's the truth so they are the podcast um the podcast is them um so thank you for that uh there were a lot of questions and I also wonder about why is it that many food additives and preservatives and dyes and things of that sort that are not allowed in Europe are allowed in US Food Products it's a really good question and decisions around food and food safety in particular are made by the Food and Drug Administration so that's the FDA uh it's not it's a separate agent independent agency it's not one that our office uh is involved in then sort of directing in any way uh and so we're not involved in those decisions and don't have insight into how they're making their drawing their conclusions but uh they do it in a process just that's you know Guided by science just like they do with medications with devices Etc with that said you know I am concerned that dietary practices the food that many Americans are consuming are in fact not supporting their health and well-being and in many ways are detracting from it uh when we look at highly processed foods one of the concerns I have there is we often see sodium content is very high we see the sugar content uh is very high and you know there are certainly additives in there as well U that I think we I would love to have more data on the actual Health impacts of those but the bottom line is that a significant portion of our diet uh is comprised of Highly processed foods in America and and that worries me the AL other piece of this that worries me are just how much you know refined sugars are being added to so much of our foods and most people think that sugars are only added to things like desserts Etc but you look at spaghetti sauces salad dressing salad dressings a lot of these things which we think of as Savory products have have sugar added to them as well and so we are consuming I think unhealthy levels of sugar in our diet we're consuming a fair amount of additives given the processed food composition in our diet and I think part of the reason this is happening and I want to be very clear I don't fault individuals out there for the composition of their diet necessarily because we have also made certain decisions in our country about uh what we subsidize about what's cheaper and more expensive for people and the cheapest Foods unfortunately are often the most unhealthy Foods the most highly processed foods uh if you are somebody who lives in a low-income neighborhood number of these neighborhoods don't even have grocery stores in them which is a you know a tragedy because you can't get fresh produce Etc a lot of times your shopping your grocery shopping may be done at a local convenience store uh at a 7-Eleven or at you know or somewhere else that may not have like the array of of fresh fruits and vegetables that you and your family need I don't even think they have vegetables I think they have they'll occasionally have some lemons or apples or oranges and bananas but when I walk into a convenience store what I see as a pharmacy I really do I see alcohol caffeine energy drinks that have a number of different things in them designed to stimulate different neuromodulators like dopamine and serotonin I see nicotine products I see high sugar high highly processed foods and keep in mind I was a teenager I mean I drank my Slurpees I had my butter fingers you know I wasn't you know Bart Simpson like in my lovely butter fingers but I liked them but but it was it was a smaller fraction of of what we ate and when we were at home those Foods were either not available or we weren't we certainly weren't allowed to eat them and um at libum you know um okay so what's clear to me is that the FDA makes decisions about what is safe what's not safe but for instance okay this last year there were "

            "text": "several papers published in highquality journals showing that if people eat just High just Sweet and Savory Foods combined that neural in the brain rewire through process of neuroplasticity that drives increased appetite and changes the response to healthier food so that they don't taste as as satiating okay that's sort of a duh to a lot of people but I think it was an important set of findings because it said the brain actually changes in response to the um the very uh Rich flavorful foods that are associated with with highly processed or even moderately processed foods okay I mean um that's just a couple of studies um there was nothing in those studies that said if you eat these Foods you're going to develop cancer but you know at some point one has to as a citizen a taxpaying citizen speaking on behalf of many other taxpaying citizens I have to sort of take a step back and say how long do we wait right do we have to get a randomized clinical trial about the you know the you know the five 100,000 sick kids that grow into sick adults um and then run a trial where they go on a an Elimination Diet where they're eating only unprocessed vegan or unprocessed meat and vegetable or unprocessed you know starch and vegetable but I mean I mean then we're talking about a 30-year Health crisis before we intervene why not I mean if I were in charge which I'm not and clearly I wouldn't survive in a government organization because um well I've got the uniform down um I always wear the same thing but um a uniform but I wouldn't because I would want to say wait you know why not a on the side of caution why not send out this AI generated text message that tells everybody in all the languages that Americans speak and can understand hey you get to make choices about what you eat but you should be aware that um making your diet comprised of more than 15 to 20% of these Foods is potentially going to lead to serious issues down the road and those serious issues are extremely serious I mean the Obesity crisis is really a crisis of both body and brain metabolic challenge um that we can talk about so you know who sets the thresholds you know in other words why is it that in this country we have to wait until people start to get really sick and dying and really struggling before something is done in the direction of their health and I'm not blaming you I just want to understand because um good question the the wealthy people I know care a lot about their food sources and they pay a lot of attention to it and why aren't we allowing everyone the opportunity to make better choices so this is the right question and this is something I I think about a lot because I'm conscious about what I eat but I also talk to folks around the country and realize a lot of people don't have either the information uh or the resources to actually purchase healthy food right and to know like what's going to be good for them and for their families this is why you know I mentioned we have a list of issues that you know we would work on you know if we had more more more resources this is actually one of them because to me one of the most common questions people ask is what should I eat that's simple but it's it's vexing it's complicated it's incredibly confusing if you go online and just try to search for information and it's a classic example of where it's important to have an objective scientific Authority that can come and then speak on Broad principles around diet that can talk about what we know and don't know so here's important thing I think a lot of times people may see something as uh you know on the market they might read list of ingredients they don't recognize how of them because they're additives but they figure well if it's there then it must have been studied for 30 40 years and there must be no harmful consequences right but sometimes things are are put out there because we have short-term data that says that they're okay and there might be uh but there may be a need for more long-term data helping people understand what do we know what do we not know is important so that people can make decisions for themselves based on how much risk they want to take the other thing that that concerns me here Andrew is I look I I have I'll tell you I have a bias here and my bias is that I am worried about the you know additives and other products we have in food that don't have long-term data uh that's clear in terms of health risk and so because of that like my bias is generally to think how can we get people uh you know minimally or less processed foods and how can we get them more fruits and vegetables how can we make sure that they have that more available to them but we've got to not only make the information available but we have to make it accessible from a cost perspective if you don't have a grocery store in your community if vegetables and fruits cost 3x what other foods do that's going to be a problem right to change diet the other thing we have to keep in mind is that you know food companies you know a lot of them do a great job of actually trying to get healthy nutritious food out to people you know and kudos to them but I worry also that there's an incentive also to just try to sell more and more and more of your product and one of the ways to do that is to try to hack uh the body to kind of figure out okay well what kind of synthetic additives could I put together here or what kind of uh combination of nutrients could I put together that will get people coming back for more and more and more and we saw this in the nicotine industry you saw the Nick industry you also I would say another parallels you see it in social media as well where the business model of the social media platforms is built on volume of use right how much time am I spending on the platforms it's not quality of time it's quantity of time right so if that's the business model then you're going to design your platform to Max maximize how much time someone spends on them regardless of whether it's detracting from sleep detracting from inperson interaction detracting from anything else it's healthy regardless of whether that may be causing certain harms right like the business model dictates you know in many ways how these things are designed and that applies I think to food as well so which is why I think it's incumbent upon us to be particularly cautious uh with highly processed foods foods that foods that have additives and to understand how is this impacting our brain how is that impacting our satiety how is it um leading potentially to Greater ingestion that is healthy and leading to things like obesity which have a whole host of other medical conditions from cancer to arthritis to diabetes and heart disease associated with it those are the questions as a as a citizen as a father of two young kids who's trying to bring them up at with a healthy lifestyle those are the questions that I would want to know the answers to and it's one of the reasons I think these kind of objective reports are so important for the public I'm starting to see the the scope of the problem and the mechanics involved in trying to alleviate these issues are complex I I I I see that they are also one other thing that is important to do that so is you need to have authorities that can speak to these issues that are insulated from political retribution right so and to explain this like Amen to that yeah I mean listen as somebody forgive me for interrupting but somebody who from time to time will um make not recommendations but we'll offer information about potential actionable items you know things that people could do or not do according to a couple of studies that come have come out I mean have come under intense scrutiny from my colleagues um who are like wait that's not a randomized control trial how can you do that and yet I know from being in this field for a long time that for instance the emerging therapies for for PTSD and depression that are now based on federal funding for things like um and I'm not recommending this by the way for children or for everybody but for instance the um macro do psilocybin therapeutically supported uh legal use of psilocybin for for uh major depression the data there are they're not perfect but they're pretty darn good compared to the major ssris um but for years if if an academic said the the words I just said they'd lose their job almost instantaneously because they're Controlled Substances um that's a that's a Todo but then there are a number of things that we're talking about here that are just about making better choices about things to avoid right if people understood I think that um is sugar poison well some of my audience will say sugar is poison it's as addictive as cocaine look it is not as addictive as cocaine or heroin it is not however if a child or adult is eating very sweet or very Savory Foods of any kind consistently if those are not um healthy foods or if they are if they contain unhealthy additives over time the brain will rewire so that healthy foods don't taste is good they won't be the choices that people make and you're going to end up with a sick individual period And I don't think we need one more clinical trial funded by federal tax dollars to support that statement what I'm starting to gather is that you're a very rational grounded broad thinkinking individual I'm not just saying that because you're sitting here and you're trained in medicine and you understand the science uh but that you don't have the means at your disposal to put out a call that says hey folks having some sugar every once in a while treating the kids to ice cream great but if 80% or more of the diet it of our kids isn't made up of minimally or non-processed Foods their brains are going to be rewired in unhealthy ways and you can almost expect that they're going to have some Health Challenge in the future that may not be um you know autism or schizophrenia but is going to be a major Health Challenge of a and that is serious and Now's the Time to intervene by avoiding certain things and if you don't want to do it look it's a free country at that level you're welcome to do it but you'd be better off spending X number of dollars on these healthier foods yeah because there's also and we know this from my colleague Ali crum's laboratory at Stanford that even the mere knowledge that certain foods are nutritious can lead to more satiety from eating those Foods at the level of hormone release not just psychologically you're telling yourself the Orange is as tasty and and filling as a candy bar but the understanding of of the fact that it is nutritious actually leads to shifts in patterns of of you know grillin secretion Etc that that change so people can be feel better on a healthier slightly lower calorie nutrient enrich diet of healthy proteins and fruits and vegetables and it's not a mind trick it's it's physiology anyway I I I think um I I feel your pain frankly and I'll tell you look sometimes people "

            "text": "ask hey why don't you just go out and say a couple of statements that you just said would that be fine like why why is time needed to prep something like that why are resources needed Etc here's actually why like I know in today's day and age it's easy to just go and like rattle off off you know off the cff statements or shoot from the Welcome on my social media channels anytime and really to get the word out to millions of people I appreciate that and I may take you up on that but I'll tell you that one of the reason one of the things we always do recognizing that when we put out statements that people people one they they trust it's coming from a scientific Authority and that it's been vetted right so we put the effort and time into vetting this thoroughly we check sources we look at the data we talk to experts we think about how to communicate this in the right way that's the work the behind the scenes work sure uh that we do before we put out sort of reports and and initiatives because we want people to have confidence you know in in what they're hearing we also know that when we put out initiatives that other people build on them philanthropists you know and and foundations will then think about should I fund work in this area uh you know schools and workplaces will think about shifting some of their practice policy makers will also think about legislation uh that they may uh want to design based on that so we want to make sure it it's really solid but the point I was making when I said also that we have to make sure that not just our office but folks who are you know in public health and who are in medicine who are trying to speak to the public about their health that they're protected from retribution and taxes this is what I meant which is that saying things about diet saying things about tobacco these can be challenging for some folks because there are Industries built around these right which may not always like what you have to say uh if it hurts their business model or their bottom line and they may then lean on um political leaders elected leaders others to then try to silence you or or shut you up and I'll tell you I've experienced this in the past you know when I was Surgeon General during my first term I had issued two uh key reports one was on alcohol drugs and health about the addiction crisis uh and the other was about the ecigarette crisis among youth I will tell you that there were plenty of people who were very unhappy that I was issuing the First Federal report on ecigarettes um folks who felt that hey um this is going to make folks unhappy it's going to create political pressure uh it's going to create a lot of problems uh similarly with alcohol drugs and health there are many folks who said hey if you do this you're really going to upset the AL alol industry do you really need to have alcohol in the report why don't you just focus on other drugs um why don't you take alcohol out of the title you know all of these sort of you know concerns telling you this who so these are people who get paid by the alcohol industry no these are people in government who are reading the te leaves and who who are supportive of the work we're doing but are saying hey like you're going to really upset a lot of people in industry and you're also going to help a lot of people yeah well this is what it comes down to they say well and if you upset folks then they're going to try to fire you they're going to try to do all these things to which honestly like my my response to a lot of these and the reason we just put them out anyway was because I said well the worst thing that can happen is I get fired and that's okay you know if I if I go out knowing I did the right thing here then I'm fine with that I'm not looking to build a lifelong career in government I'm not doing this job to like you know get to the next thing on the ladder like this is about serving for the time I can I want to be able to go to sleep at night look myself in the mirror and know I did so with Integrity um so that was an easy decision for me but but my point is that like we have to be thoughtful that in these issues that there are going to be headwinds right I'm sure in your case for example you've probably gotten push back from folks about talking about certain things that may have rankled folks who may have had an interest in those issues and that's okay you keep talking about them as as you should and I'm grateful for that um but this is especially important at a time where I think public trust in our institutions more broadly and in science and in medicine medicine have taken a hit over the last few years and I think it's a time where we have to be even more Vigilant those of us in medicine and public health to make sure that what we do is based on data that we're transparent about why we're saying what we're saying that we're also clear about what we know and what we don't know so that if recommendations change over time people recognize that this isn't necessarily flip-flopping you should change your recommendations if the data changes uh if the circumstances change so uh anyway this is all part of the work that we've got to do but to me this is a really important part of the work the Integrity behind our work in public health is not just about the issue we're taking on today it's about the trust that we need to rebuild uh in the field more broadly so if I understand correctly if you were to for instance uh "

            "text": "initiatives in general um the question is about masks um early in the pandemic as I recall we were told that masks were not necessary then we were told they are necessary and I think for a lot of people that flip in messaging um landed like a parent telling their teenage kid to always wear a seat belt but then you look into the front seat and Mom and Dad aren't wearing seat belts and as anyone who's been around teenagers there has been one you make that mistake once you're not making it again and you may never recover from that particular example in other words the public felt like there was a switch of messaging but what I don't recall happening was a like a hey we got that one wrong so sorry on us MH you know what the new data say blank what I recall was a message of don't and then do but there wasn't a lot of um kind of acknowledgment of of how challenging the situation was it was just a lot of top down mandates and in my opinion and this is just my opinion I think that led to a pretty rapid distrust of subsequent messages from which we still haven't really recovered um and so why do you think it's so challenging for public facing officials to just say look doing the best we can at the moment screwed up before changing the message now may change again we're navigating this in in real time it's Dynamic yeah please stay with us because you know goes without saying there's been a huge Chasm around this and related issues yeah look this it's an important question and look I I'm always I want to be thoughtful about um you know how I comment on what was done in the first year of the pandemic I was I was a citizen I was outside government and I don't know what was happening inside government in terms of the the decisions that were made made there but I do know sometimes from my experience in Ebola and in zika during those uh experiences we had as a country that in the you know in the fog of War when everything's coming at you sometimes it's hard to make the right decision all the time right so I I want to give some of those folks who were there uh you know in the first year of the pandemic you know some benefit of the doubt but I do think that the important thing uh the principle I I certainly try to follow but one I think that uh and you know we can all do better I Can Do Better certainly too uh but I think an important principle for us in public health communication has to be that we're clear that we're transparent about what we know and what we don't know uh and that we explain the why to people so if we're telling someone to do something why is it because there's a lot of data behind it is it because it's a sort of expert agreement best practice because sometimes as you know in in medicine sometimes when we don't have enough data to guide us on on a therapeutic approach but when the problem is imminent then sometimes experts will get together and put together expert inform formed guidelines to say okay look based on our best judgment and the limited data we have here's what we would recommend and as the data evolves we will change you know and and modify those recommendations we do that with hypertension right you evolve and update recommendations we do that with lipids um here too I think that has to be like a key part of the approach I think one of the challenges that I saw many public health officials encounter was even when they went out with Comprehensive messages like that uh which are hard to fit into a sound bite or into simple posts on social media um often a lot of that wasn't covered what gets covered is the Top Line you know this is what's being recommended that's what's being required Etc all the explanation is lost it's missing right and I think we also are living in a time where people are reading headlines like they're living busy lives right they're not necessarily you know always hearing all of the Nuance you know that's being explained um but I think that that's a challenge right is like I know many public officials struggled with how do you deliver nuanced information uh at a time when there isn't a clear black and white answer to things but I think the last piece around this is um I think something I was taught early in medical school is to approach your patients with humility recognizing that even though you have more training than they do uh you don't aren't living their life you don't necessarily know what they're going through and you shouldn't assume um things about them right and so approaching with humility means that um you've got to recognize that not everyone's going to be able to follow your guidance and if they aren't able to that doesn't mean you criticize them it also means recognizing that people may have ideas or suggestions for you that may actually improve your recommendations or how you communicate and so I these are the principles I think that are important in public communication but I think that both the challenge of translating nuanced arguments into what's actually covered that was tough for many public health officials I think the other thing honestly just on a human level that became hard for many of them and I I'm thinking particularly about local and state public health officials who are on the front lines that I talked to a lot was they ended up getting attacked a lot and abused a lot during the pandemic and I don't just mean like attacked online I mean people showing up at their houses people harassing their children uh people threatening their safety um and and this was often people who were upset about some of the requirements that were being put down from local Departments of health and you can understand Co was as stressful a time as we've seen recently people lost their jobs people were losing loved ones I mean talk about a stressful time but I think at a human level Public Health officials who were exposed to that kind of abuse and who started to worry about their children's safety um many of them stepped out of the arena and said is this really worth it to put my family at risk um and that was hard because we lost a lot of good Public Health people in that respect so I think I think in addition to having sort of these core principles of public health communication in place I think what we also need to restore is an environment where we of frankly of humility and civility where where we don't attack people you know who maybe have different views or are coming out with recommendations that um you know are not palatable uh to us and uh and I think it's also incumbent upon our leaders in society to not Stoke that kind of resentment and violence as well CU that happened during the pandemic as Co got increasingly politicized and you know while that may have been at times done for political reasons here or there the people who suffered were both the public health leaders who were trying to do the right thing for their communities and the public themselves who weren't able to have a clear direct channel uh to and a dialogue with their Public Health officials uh because a lot of that ended up getting closed off yeah I feel like there was a lot of talking down to the dissenters in the general public yeah uh and I totally agree that um you know getting violent or harassing people with whom you disagree is is totally inappropriate Andrew the one thing just to say about the humility "

            "text": "piece and I'll give you an example here of where I think this could have and should have been done better is it an effort for example around masks uh to recommend that people wear masks and one important thing just to know is that when it comes to like schools requiring masks like those are decisions that are made on local levels right the federal government doesn't mandate masks in schools uh doesn't have the authority to do that so those are local local decisions but at the end of the day there were people who did not want their children to wear masks right for a variety of reasons uh some worried about their develop Social Development some worried that it was adding stress to their kids like people had met different reasons why they may or may not have wanted their children to wear masks and one of the things I think that was not helpful was that when there were parents who made the decision they didn't want their kids to wear masks um I think some of them received a lot of critic iism uh without people necessarily stopping to understand why they may have been making that decision because I'll say as a parent whose children were in school you know my kids are five and seven and um in the first year of the pandemic they were doing preschool virtually which was a nightmare it was incredibly hard for us even when they got back to school in the fall of 2021 um it was a really tough like adjustment for them and I could understand like some of the concerns that parents uh were having wondering about hey how are these precautions affecting my child's experience and Social Development so on the whole this the recommendation may still be uh Hey improve ventilation your classrooms recommend masking recommend testing Etc but those recommendations I think have to be made in a way that acknowledges like the humanity of people who are may have a different point of view or may make a different decision uh for their child and I know that when loc localities made the decision in many cases to require uh schools in their you know kids in their District to wear a mask that put some parents who didn't want that they put them in a hard place right and but I think that our failure to actually have an open honest respectful conversation about this where we didn't feel like we were uh each being attacked you know as parents for our decisions or as community members for the decisions we were making I think that not only hindered I think the response but I think it actually contributed to this division the sense of black and whiteness that hey it's us against them and then suddenly if I was against one measure then I was against all of them you know or if I was for one measure I was for all of them because we just started segregating into sites uh and this became a polarized uh you know experience at a time where really it should have been a crisis that brought us together as messy as it was um and that honestly Andrew is what I worry about most for the next pandemic right like I think we've learned a lot from this pandemic about uh how to manufacture vaccines and de and how to develop them quickly uh how to distribute them uh efficiently uh and you know we had one one was one of the I think most historic and and effective vaccine distribution efforts in this country even though certainly could have been better but it was historic by by all measures um we've learned a lot about how to do vaccines Therapeutics uh a lot of the nuts and bolts of a pandemic response well but I worry what we are still struggling with is how we build trust how we communicate with the public and how we stay together as a country in the face of adversity because if we're going to if we're divided the way we were during coid during the next pandemic or the next you know for a threat that may come from a foreign adversary that's a huge national security issue for us and so that that's what keeps me up at night when I think about the next pandemic that may come two questions relate to what you just "

            "text": "said first of all um as it relates to vaccines in my opinion um and I think the opinion of many people out there that the response to the next pandemic um will be heavily contingent on at least some sort of acknowledgment that there are people who at least feel that there have been vaccine injuries right to Simply say um okay the previous time round with coid went this way and now there's now virus X right let's hope not God forbid but sounds like it's coming at some point and people are going to think to the last time and they're going to immediately say well the last time we were told to you know uh take a vaccine some people had a good experience with that other people didn't and it in this empathy model of acknowledging and you know you know letting your moral compass guide and understanding the why behind what people are are are doing and how they're reacting it seems to me that now would be the time to at least try and understand where they're coming from even if one disagrees maybe even especially if one disagrees and try and get people aligned now before the next pandemic it and um so what efforts are being made if any to try and acknowledge um that some people really do feel as if they were harmed I'm not saying if they were or not but clearly there are people who feel that they were people they know were harmed is there an effort to present them with data to have discussions with them to try and get people aligned so that the next time around uh we can be more of a unified front whatever the necessary response happens to be yeah no it's a really important question and and to me I always go back to sort of first principles from practicing medicine right which is if there is a medicine you give a patient and even if it helps 99.99% of patients but this one particular patient happen to be harmed by it you go in you acknowledge it you talk about it and you together TR out a path for how you want to move forward and the path forward might be yes let's get rid of that medication but let's use an alternative let's try it or we can't use that medication anymore here are the risks you may sustain but we'll find other ways to protect you right so that's what we would do in medicine right that's what I've done with patients over the years I think here too similarly when I think when it comes to tracking Adverse Events from vaccines this is an area where the CDC and the FDA track and collaborate uh and tracking means not just not only collecting reports from the public and from clinicians when they see uh an effect that may be related to a vaccine but it also involves analyzing those to see were they correlated or were there's actual causation there right because um you know if I if today for example uh I felt unwell uh and I trace back what happened yesterday and it turns out hey I ate this burrito that was out in the the Sun for way too long um the question is am I feeling sick because the burrito or did the burrito just happen to be you know a you know something that happened but it's independent of how I'm feeling um maybe it turns out somebody was actually sick uh with a GI bug you know around me and that's the reason uh that I'm feeling the way I am today so the analysis that needs to be done on cases that are reported uh is important and it's something that the CDC and the FDA do together now that analysis I think is essential to communicate clearly to the public um and whenever I engage with folks in the public which we do often and people will talk to me about their experiences with vaccines I do think it's important to acknowledge what people have gone through um like some people for example like when I got uh vaccinated for Co for example I I felt like I had mild flu like symptoms for a couple of days you know it wasn't great I would have preferred I didn't you know have those feelings like you know and uh then I felt better a couple of days later and then I moved on but you know I acknowledge it didn't feel good you know to to feel that way there are other people who may have had U experiences where they felt that they had more serious uh you know side effects and there may be a question was that related to the vaccine or not so I think we have to both hear and acknowledge those I certainly try to do that I know I think it's important to keep doing that across all of government but I also think it's important for us to to help people understand the process that we have to go through to understand whether those are related or not if you go online and the cdc's uh site where they collect a lot of this information and you just purely look at reports that are given of potential adverse effects that you can't sort of take that and say ah those are all related to the vaccine look at this rate of harm it's extraordinarily High because we don't actually do that with any other vaccine or medicine right sure we we start there we do the analysis and we try to understand what's actually related or not so I think that's that's what we've got to do here too one last thing I'll say is that it's important I think also for us to to help put this in context of other vaccines and medicines and interventions that we use so for example just take Tylenol for example like most people think oh well Tylenol it's safe there's nothing bad happens if you take Tylenol Etc but people who track the data know that Tylenol by and large is a generally speaking a safe medication but there are people who experience adverse effects from Tylenol liver damage you know and and other adverse effects uh and you know that data is available but what has happened in the case of that medication is that the risks and benefits are both analyzed and then a recommendation is put forward about a generally safe way to use it and then there's data put out about the the side effects common or rare right but I think sometimes we also forget that a lot of the medicines that we have come to take and just see as normal part of our life just like any other vaccine like there's some rate of rare side effects that will happen I say that because what I worry about in the black and white environment that we're living in is sometimes people will take an anecdote about a potential adverse effect and we'll portray that as the rule right and we'll say well look I know somebody who had this side effect so nobody should take this because this is what's going to happen to you if we did that nobody would ever take Tylenol no one would ever take Ibuprofen no one would take NyQuil like no one would take any of the common medications that we pick up at the drugstore and that we commonly use so uh that's how I think we have to approach this with a combination of of clear communication empathic listening and and data and cont text um again that doesn't fit neatly in a in a in a social media post per se but I think part of what we're we need to do as a country is rebuild the relationship honestly between the medical and public health establishment and the public and I think it's starts with this kind of communication uh the other question I had about the next pandemic and the one "

            "text": "we just had is uh why not have Committees of people of diverse backgrounds socioeconomic diversity racial diversity uh every aspect of diversity rather than individuals standing there telling us what to do for several reasons one is um we are a country of many different people yeah I think we um there are dozens if not hundreds of scientific papers showing that patients follow the advice of doctors that look like them and sound like them or to whom they would aspire to be like yeah we know this and yet Public Health officials typically are unitary one person telling us do this don't do that this is a good idea that's a bad idea I I'm but one citizen but I'm putting up both hands both feet and all toes and saying that committees small but diverse committees that people can relate to and feel as if um the messages that they're getting are vetted through a common understanding yeah so it's a really good suggestion and and I could agree with you more that A diversity of voices is really important to to get a message out out and during Co actually that's one of the things that our office actually was was helping to build was something called the community core right where we actually we recognize so very clearly this is something I you know I came to see as a doctor sometimes I was the right person to message to a patient sometimes I wasn't right sometimes it was the nurse sometimes it was uh the medical student sometimes it was an administrator or the the social worker with different background different life experiences so part of this work is knowing when to step up when to step back right but the community Corp that we were building was a really diverse uh you know group of people um and a lot of them had Public Health backgrounds but a lot of them were Community leaders who understood Health even though they didn't have formal training um but they're people who knew their communities right and they had the trust of their communities and they understood what was going on they wanted to be helpful so we brought them together to say okay look here's what the science is telling us here the general recommendations um here's what we would provide uh you ask us any questions you have like if there's something we don't know we'll go back and look it up um but you're the leaders in your community they should be hearing from you you know about about these messages and then that those folks went out and actually we worked closely with them collaborated with them uh they would design the messages for their community based on what they thought made sense they weren't taking what we said word for word and we didn't want them to um but to me like that kind of diverse approach is what we need more of now you know I'll tell you what I would I would have liked I would have liked if more media networks put those folks on TV and got them on the radio right because it's important that many of them were showing up in their communities were knocking on doors were uh doing local you know podcasts Etc and that was great but I would have liked more of their faces I carried on TV right so that's a place where when when we talk to media and when I talk to folks in media one of the things I encourage them and push them to do also is to say look if you can take more of these diverse faces and voices and put them out there that's actually good for the community and it also helps people see that it's not like one or two people who are sort of pushing an agenda here this is like the Public Health Community is Big it's broad it's diverse it has a lot of voices and and as the more voices we can hear from as public I think the better off we are yeah here here I I you know again I genuinely hope and pray that we don't have another pandemic but if and when we do I hope there will be committees rather than individuals I know we you know this is a thing in this country we like the idea that one person's going to save the climate one person's going to save transportation one person you know the covers the person of the year type approach um but we but then we get frustrated when that person does things or makes decisions that we don't like in their public or personal life and then it all seems to fall into Division and I just feel like we not talking about groups of hundreds of people but small groups so I think we're aligned in that way yeah and and look there there's I think a notion that um I think sometimes we do want like the one person who can not only necessarily have all our trust and we can look to but also who we can hold accountable you know if something uh doesn't quite work out if we don't like something um and and while I get that sort of mentality I think that in this moment especially when we're trying to rebuild trust I think it's important for people to know that what they may be hearing in terms of medical or SC Public Health recommendations it's important for them to know how broad an audience that's coming from or broad a group of experts right and we there was a lot more broad agreement for example during coid and uh during Ebola during zika on Public Health recommendations but you wouldn't always know it if you turn on the TV because you were seeing the same couple of faces so I think we have to to certainly diversify that um one other thing I think I'll tell you that's important here is I think we have to also think about how we fund groups on the ground that are doing the the hard work of getting Public Health messages out because one of the things that those groups often would tell me and these are I might say the groups I'm I'm talking about the community organization that spent years in a neighborhood getting to know families where folks recognize them when they're walking down the street they're like oh yeah that's a person from organization X they understand us they get us they're looking out for us a lot of those organizations had spent their resources helping the community getting to know the community but they didn't have sophisticated mechanisms to apply for grants for example they didn't have grant writers who had done this a thousand times so historically those groups have a hard time getting support and funding so I'll tell you one interesting thing my my wife did which I certainly was very of is she was helping to to build an effort and to build a nonprofit organization with a couple of colleagues that organization of people who knew how to get money how to apply for Grants how to get Foundation support but who also had the wisdom to know that the most important they could do was to give portions of that money to groups on the ground so they saw themselves as an organization that channeled money to groups that had trust and they executed their their their mission that way and that was very effective and I think we need more of that when it comes to disseminating funding one thing I think many people may not uh may or may not appreciate is that when you it's actually hard from government to put out a lot of money uh at once and to do so quickly right um like when you've got a lot of funds that you need to get into communities what happens is the federal government often will give it to States states will then give it to local communities uh to like the local Department of Public Health part potentially and then they will look to distribute it to others that takes time but also means if you're not connected to that network if you don't know your local Department of Health or you're not connected to the State Department of Health sometimes it can be challenging to figure out how to get the money and so I think we need more operations like you know like what my wife and others have been building to try to get those funds directly to the folks who not you don't necessarily have the most fancy you know grant writing operation but they have their relationships because at the end of the day it's those relationships that create the trust it's a trust that allows in life-saving information to get to people and that's the link that's missing very interesting Pharma big Pharma I got a "

            "text": "lot of questions about whether or not big Pharma is on the take for every Public Health Initiative now as uh somebody who understands a bit about and certainly believes in the use of certain prescription medications I find most um questions about quote unquote big Pharma to overlook fact that there are thousands if not hundreds of thousands of medications that save lives and enrich people's lives that are prescription drugs um I also believe my audience knows I say it over and over again that Better Living Through Chemistry still requires Better Living we still have to get our sunlight get our sleep social connection good nutrition exercise and all those things there's just no pill that's going to replace those yeah okay but I think it's a valid question that people are asking is there a direct relationship between between big Pharma and public health initiatives in a way that should have us concerned about the messaging that we're getting and at times and the fact that the United States consumes the vast majority of drugs for mental health for instance as compared to other countries so that's one question and then um I want to dovetail into that question what are your thoughts on the fact that you know there's a history of say the tobacco industry being you know uh very uh interdigitated shall we say with um government policies in ways that had us basically injure if not kill millions of Americans and then eventually say you can't smoke on near a hospital you can't smoke anywhere there's very few places where you can consume tobacco products you know that that kind of um relationship and financial incentives and then a lot of backpedaling later um I think wore on people's um trust MH so how should we frame the relationship between the pharmaceutical industry government and public health initiatives in a way that is you know at least halfway functional it look I I understand where the concern and suspicion comes from right and look I I think it's important that public health initiatives and medical advice is independent of the influence of industries that may seek to profit uh from what's being recommended or from medications that are being prescribed and we look we have a history in medicine right of doctors who were you know given gifts and vacations and all kinds of fancy things by Pharma companies in an effort to influence what they prescribed that was really problematic and now we're seeing a lot less of that which is good a lot of rules are being put in place by medical societies and professional societies and by academic institutions to say this is an unacceptable way to practice and that's really important because I do think that human psychology is that sometimes we underestimate how much we're influenced by incentives we think ah yeah I'm getting that but I know how to make independent decisions but at the end of the day we're human and and we influenced or it's a great drug it could be wow this is a drug that's really helping my patients I'm happy to recommend it to them yeah so the this so I want to separate one thing though like taking money from Pharma companies as a physician I think is highly problematic right I think it's hard to say that it doesn't influence practice maybe it doesn't for some people but it's just it's really hard to know who those people are um I do think that separate from that you can be a physician who prescribes medications because you believe they work look as a doctor I have prescribed many antibiotics during cases of infection that have helped my patients and I would prescribe those again I am glad that those exist um in many cases they've saved the lives you know of patients I was caring for in the hospital so that's what what should drive us is is does the data show that they work and does our patient need them right that's what should drive our decisions when it comes to Public Health recommendations here too I think a similar principle holds which is that I don't think that Pharma money uh should be influencing our Public Health decisions which means that it shouldn't be funding our public health organizations that are making recommendations certainly I'll you know I know this is obvious to you but I'll say just to be clear for everyone who's listening like our office uh doesn't take any money from industry not just Pharma industry from any industry like our the money that we get is allocated by Congress at the end of the day it's taxpayer money and that's all we get and and that's important we don't want money from the you know from pharmaceutical companies um but that's important because people need to know that these decisions are not being made for for financial gain um with that being said I there's a broader concern I have Andrew which is I think that we have become a pill for every problem Society where we look for a quick fix of a medicine for every challenge uh that we may incur and sometimes yes I'm I'm a believer that if science you know helps us create uh medications that can help solve disease we should use them appropriately but I think we discount heavily the behavioral changes that we need to make the more broader societal and environmental changes that we need to make that influence our health like our food environment matters for our health our decisions about how Physically Active we are matter for our health whether or not we sleep matters for our health and all of these impact our mental health and well-being as well and so I I when when I think about the that bias that that to me is not always you know stemming from money that came from a pharmaceutical company although I think it the ads that we see all the time uh from Pharma companies I think try to convince us that hey just take this pill once a day and all your problems will go away but I think it's more complex than that and and I think that even for you know in the health care setting like if you're uh if you're seeing a patient who has pain uh who's having intense pain it feels easier sometimes to prescribe a medication for that pain rather than trying to to deal with non-medication based you know approaches or try to get the deeper origins of the pain I'm not saying that's what doctors do all the time but I'm saying that we're living in an environment and a broader culture where we I think increase ly reach for something that we see as a quick immediate fix uh and again don't blame people for that we rather take a quick fix over something that's going to take a long time but I think it is selling us I think sometimes a false hope which is that that's all we need to solve our problems and I think a lot of times you need more you need the behavioral changes you need the environmental changes um that's one of my big concerns in terms of how we communicate about health would a potential solution be "

            "text": "this idea of small committees so let's say uh somebody is experiencing chronic pain localized or general that they would go to their general practitioner but in the room would also be somebody who understands sematic medicine uh a trained clinical psychologists who understand sematics that the body and the brain are linked through the nervous system um and could also assess um you know possible psychological Roots uh of the issue and then somebody in the room who can make um Behavior nutritional um maybe even supplementation based safe supplementation based recommendations and then the physician who can say you know and in addition to that I think the person should have on hand you know a 5 milligram dosage of a prescription drug that if they need it they could take and I think it would provide a lot of protections against you know uh potential adverse effects of any one of those things in isolation um there are great Protections in having people meet in groups um for lots of reasons and the person would feel very well cared for um so again small Committees of people with diverse expertise pooling together to treat people from a for lack of a better word a more holistic perspective why not I mean you're describing the dream I think that's exactly what we need interdisciplinary teams that can provide integrative care recognizing that in this day and age there's not one person who has all the expertise to help us figure out how to best manage our health challenges um I think what we have not figured out are a couple of things number one who are all the right people who need to be in the room uh or the sort of virtual room if you will the second is how do we create a a structure a Health Care System where that can actually happen with efficiency where it can be reimbursed appropriately but that's what we should be doing and then the Third Leg of that is the the group experience for patients right and there's increasingly in more clinics and healthc Care Systems around the country that are working on creating group experiences where patients who all let's say are working on diabet on their diabetes uh come together let's say once a week and they meet uh with the healthcare practitioner that might be an addition to their individual appointments but there is so much power in groups coming together uh groups of patients who can find Community who can help each other learn from each other's experiences uh that's highly underutilized right now in medicine um but to really do this well Andrew I think means that we have to we have to pull back from the model we have had for years in medicine which has been a very a highly individual type model which says okay you go to your doctor you see your doctor oneon-one you get everything you need maybe you need to go see a specialist okay then you wait a few weeks get another appointment Drive 30 miles go see somebody else maybe they're connected to the electronic health system maybe they're not maybe they know what was discussed maybe they they don't maybe they'll call and talk to their primary care doctor but maybe they won't because they're too busy and then you as a patient are stuck trying to piece all this together while often in pain well yeah in in physical and emotional anguish I'm not referring to my own experience although I've had you know mild examples compared to what other people have dealt with but you know people with chronic pain are irritable for understandable reasons I mean it it it's or maybe somebody's close veering towards suicidal depression then there's the interpersonal effects I mean I feel like the the crisis is is one of a lack of efficiency and thoroughness and um and again I'm not throwing stones at the medical profession I I like you believe that it's a collection of mostly um well-meaning people trying to do their best but the specialist model and the referral model is incredibly cumbersome it really is cumbersome and and like you look I having worked with many medical professions over the years like these are colleagues who I deeply admire I mean like they're there for the right reasons they want to help people alleviate suffering but they too are feeling burned out and frustrated by the inefficiencies of the system because I'll tell you one of the greatest contributors to burnout for doctors and nurses is a lack of self-efficacy it's seeing a patient who has a problem in front of you and feeling like you can't get them the help uh that they need that is a the greatest paper cut if you will uh to the sort of spirit of clinicians and many find themselves in that circumstance where they either find that they know what's needed but the system is throwing up prior authorizations or other insurance hurdles and prev their patient from getting that care or they are kind of at the edge of their expertise right this happens to pediatricians and primary care doctors more broadly all the time with mental health right most of the mental health care that's delivered in this country is delivered in primary care offices right now Primary Care offers didn't necessarily train specifically and only in mental health yet they find themselves having to manage a lot of that including increasingly complex substance use disorders uh and you treatment resistant depression and they need help figuring that out but if you don't have a lot of resources to get that referral to collaborate with the mental health professionals then you're stuck on your own figuring that out and so you look I think the pain is being experienced mostly by patients and but also very much so by clinicians and that's why that overhaul is needed and I I think look a lot of this is you know I'm not a healthcare Economist per se but I will say that a lot of this I think is tied into the business model that we built around medicine uh the notion that um you know we're paying individual people for IND idual services and individual procedures that are done uh while that has some Merit in some cases what we really care about is that the person is getting efficient integrated multi-disciplinary care overall and so when health systems for example come together and say okay rather than um sort of focusing on the amount I'm getting reimbursed for every procedure we're going to take more of a value based approach here where we say okay we've got a certain amount of money to care for certain people what's the most efficient way for us to provide them care recognizing if we don't do that it's not only bad for them but our costs in the long term will go up because we're not getting reimbursed for every procedure we're getting reimbursed for the the care overall care that we're taking for a patient so there are more of these value-based models that are are being adopted uh certainly in 2010 when the Affordable Care Act was passed and when uh other measures were taken in the Obama Administration in Medicare like that really pushed value based payment models forward um and again they're not perfect they've got they need their own tweaks but I don't think that the existing Financial structure that we had in medicine was serving Us in terms of delivering the kind of multi-disciplinary integrated efficient care that we increasingly need tough problem but through recognition of tough problems comes good Solutions that's my belief I'm an optimist at the end of the day you mentioned mental health uh lately you've been increasingly vocal "

            "text": "about the crisis of isolation just one second Andrew before we go there just one thing I about the tough problems right you're exactly right and the problem is the longer we take to acknowledge and address these tough problems the more entrenched the interests become that profit from the status quo right so if you look at um the private insurance industry uh right now there are so many challenges we have right now with patients and clinicians saying that they know what care is needed but it gets denied they know what care is needed but prior authorizations you know get grown up there and required uh even for a medicine that clearly your patient needs urgently you know I've had the experience myself of having a family member who's needed a medication for an urgent situation and then being told that the pharmacy will not fill it because it requires a prior authorization but that can't be processed uh until the weekend is over because no one's in the office to approve the prior authorization and you're thinking to yourself does this make any sense like this is an urgent situation my family member needs his medication I've also had the experience as a doctor of fighting for my patients who have been denied Care by an insurance company being on the phone saying I'm sitting here in front of my patient I know that they are sick I know they can't go home I know they need to be in rehab there's nobody literally to help them at home but then not having like the the rehab bed approved by somebody who's not even there right and there's also just a a practice that we've seen time and time again where insurance companies will also just burden clinicians with more and more requests for information before they will agree to reimburse for services that have already been delivered for a patient who needs them which is just creating more and more barriers hoping that if you're a small time doc out there who's got you know your shingle that you put up you don't have a lot of resources how are you going to keep fighting all of this and sending more and more paperwork and So eventually you'll just give up um we have a lot of problems right there in an industry that should be delivering care often is doing good things but too often I think is allowing barriers to be put up uh to the care that's needed and this is particularly true with mental health I know we're going to talk about that but Mental Health Care is just been such a difficult thing for people to get in our country and part of the reason there are many reasons but one of them is that insurance companies historically did not reimburse adequately or in the same level for mental health care as they did for physical healthare or if they did they would only reimbursed for a limited number of sessions that you could have uh but how if if you're a mom out there who sees her child struggling uh with depression you're really worried um you don't want to be told you know what uh you can only get three sessions that's it what are you supposed to do after three sessions right uh and so what has happened is that even though in 2008 there was a law p called the addiction uh equity and mental health parity law even though that was passed to try to close that Gap there were many ways that insurance companies were skirting it right so one the law wasn't even being adequately were enforced for many years but two insurance companies sometimes would say okay you know we're reimbursing adequately but when you look in the network they had very few provider so you really couldn't access somebody right so that was a problem for patients and then the other challenge is that they would say okay you can see somebody but you've got to complete this prior authorization have that completed by your primary care doctor Etc again throwing up more and more barriers so very recently in fact just a few weeks ago um President Biden just announced that we are from as an Administration putting out a proposed rule to actually strengthen uh the mental health parody law to prevent some of these what I think of as abusive practices because they're preventing people who need care from getting it and if you've ever been as I know many people have been who are listening to this if you've ever been in a situation where you or somebody you love has struggled with a mental health concern what you need in that circum cumstance is help you don't need to be filling out paperwork you don't need to be waiting 3 months to actually get care you don't need to show up and be told only you only have two more appointments you need to know that help is there when you need it and a lot of these uh denials are are being issued to people who have done their their part of the bargain they' paid their premiums they've held up their end of the bargain and Care should be there for them when they need it so anyway this is something that upsets me a lot because I just I have seen too many patients over the years struggle without the care that they deserve and should get because the barriers that are being thrown up uh by industry but I say all that just to say that when you take on big problems you will run up against entrenched interests and that's a fight we have to take on we can't shy away from it we can't say you know this is politically too difficult like one of the things I'm very proud of is that we're finally negotiating on drug prices through the Medicare program something that should have been done decades ago but it's finally happening now um you know the administration just decided this has got to happen it was passed by Congress this is good uh and it just it makes no sense that we would pay more than we need to and pass the cost on to taxpayers uh when we can negotiate and we got to get look you got to if you're collecting taxes as Government you should be doing your best to make sure every one of those dollars is being spent well right cuz somebody took money out of their paycheck uh didn't use it for their family didn't use it for their kids and they gave to the government for good reason because that supports First Responders police officers a whole bunch of services that we need but the responsibil in government is to make sure that money is being used well and to pay more for medications than we should makes no sense at all especially for patients and taxpayers so clearly some steps in the right direction are occurring while on the topic of mental health um let's talk "

            "text": "about the isolation crisis um what is the isolation crisis what aspects of mental and physical health is is it impacting and then um perhaps most importantly what can we each and all do about it mhm well this is one of those issues that I if you had told me Andrew 10 years ago hey you and I are going to be sitting here talking about loneliness and isolation I would have said I don't think so but I was really educated by people I met across the country about the fact that this was a real problem and the truth is it was familiar to me because of my own personal experiences you know as as a child I struggled a lot with a sense of loneliness and isolation I was really shy as a kid I was pretty introverted and I wanted to to make friends and hang out with other kids but it took me a while to actually build those relationships so um I spent a lot of time feeling left out you know there were times when I I I I would like when in elementary school and there were days where I pretended I had a stomach ache and so that my mom wouldn't make me go to school and it wasn't cuz I was scared of a test or a teacher cuz I didn't want to like walk into the cafeteria one more time and be scared that there was nobody to sit next to or that no one would want me to uh to be at their bench um I as I know what it feels like and I also know what the shame is like because I never told my parents about this well I never told anyone about that um because even though I knew my parents loved me I just felt like hey if I'm feeling this lonely it means something's wrong with me I'm not likable I'm not lovable I'm something's got to be it's got to be my fault in some way it was only years later Andrew when I talked to friends from grade school that I realized that a lot of them were feeling the same thing we were all struggling by ourselves uh no one really knew it and I came to see a lot of this as a doctor when I was taking care of patients and I never took a class on loneliness in medical school it wasn't part of our residency curriculum yet when I showed up in the hospital I found that the patient who had come in with a diabetic wound infection or who had come in um you know because they had had a heart attack when I sat down and talked to them often in the background they would talk about how lonely they were sometimes I would ask them hey you know I need to have a difficult conversation about uh your diagnosis is there somebody you'd want me to call to be with you during this time and too often the answer was you know I wish there was but there's nobody I'll just have the conversation by myself so but it was when I was Surgeon General I realized that those experiences weren't limited to me and my patients but they were incredibly common and two things I learned when I dug into the data Andrew was number one that loneliness is exceedingly common with one in two adults in America reporting measurable levels of loneliness but the numbers are actually even higher among young adults and adolescents the numbers and among uh youth actually depending on the surveys you look at are between 70 to 80% uh who say that they are struggling with loneliness so that's the first thing that I learned but the second thing was how consequential loneliness was I used to think loneliness was just a bad feeling what I came to see in digging into the scientific lit literature was that feeling socially disconnected being lonely and isolated was actually associated with increased risk of depression anxiety suicide but also an increased risk of cardiovascular disease of dementia and these are not small risks we're talking about 29% increase in the risk of coronary heart disease 31% risk and the increased risk of stroke 50% increased risk of dementia among older people increased risk of premature death and the mortality impact of of loneliness by the way and loneliness and isolation uh is comparable uh you know to the mortality impact of many other illnesses in fact it's even greater than the mortality impact we see associated with obesity which is something we clearly recognize as a public health issue so you put all this together and for me one of the key takeaways is that loneliness and isolation are critical public health challenges that are hiding behind the curtain behind this wall of stigma and shame and unless we talk about it and address it unless we reconcile what's been happening to us over the last 50 years where fewer and fewer people are participating in community organizations where more and more people are feeling isolated then we're not going to be able to repair the fraying foundations of society which are grounded fundamentally in our connection to one another you mentioned Community organizations um could you elaborate on "

            "text": "uh you know growing up in the 70s and 80s I was exposed to like Community soccer teams swim team there was a community pool these were all public uh things uh there were um churches synagogues and mosques are we not seeing as much participation in those those types of organizations anymore and what other types of organizations are are out there that um you know come to mind when you think about the isolation crisis yeah so there there are several factors that have led to us being as isolated as we are one of them as you mentioned is the decline in participation in community organizations and this isn't a recent phenomenon this has been happening over the last half century in America we've seen lower participation in faith organizations in recreational leagues in service organizations and other community groups that used to bring us together and I think you know we can talk about the reasons why that has been the case U but one of the key consequences of that is that people don't have places where they can come together and get to know one another especially across differences so we actually associate more and more with people who are like us but this has also been fueled by a few other factors uh that are going on at the same time one is that just from a cultural perspective as modernity has arrived not just in the US but in other other countries we've seen that people are more mobile right they move around more we don't always stay in the community that we grew up in uh we tend to even if we move somewhere else for a school we may go somewhere else for a job we may change jobs and move somewhere else we are leaving behind communities that we grew up with that we went to school with that we worked with and I'm not saying that's all a bad thing right we're having more opportunities and that's a really good thing but I think one thing that we have not accounted for is the cost of these changes right if we know what the costs are of certain actions we may still take those actions but we may find ways to mitigate the the costs we may in this case invest more in our relationships be more conscious about reaching out to other people going to visit at them uh but that has been a a quiet but but devastating Consequence the other piece with modernity is that we have more convenience in our life which means that we also don't need to see other people to get certain things done like buying groceries or mailing an item out or getting something from the store I can sit in the comfort of my home and have everything just come to me now on the one hand that's incredibly efficient right but I think efficiency is an interesting thing because it's only one factor we should be considering in our lives there too we have to ask the cost and one interesting thing about Co is many people in the first year of Co when we were all separated from one another you know when we finally came back together again I had so many people who said to me you know what I expected to miss my parents and my siblings and my friends not being able to see them what I didn't expect was missing the strangers that I saw at the coffee shop or the folks who I ran into the grocery store or seeing neighbors as I walked down the street like I actually missed that more than I thought I would so we have lost out on some of those interactions and those loose ties but the final thing to keep in mind also is about what is happening with how we are using social media technology which I think is fundamentally transformed how we interact with one another and how we see ourselves and each other and this is particularly true for young people uh who are growing up as digital natives but what has happened there I worry is that and and it's not that social media is all bad just to be clear you know technology look I'm I'm a believer that in technology broadly speaking you know I'm a user of technology I spent seven years building a tech company I'm a Believer in Tech but I think whether technology helps or hurts us is about how it's designed and ultimately about how it ends up being used and what we've seen with social media as well is that uh for many people it ended up leading to in-person connections being replaced with online connections um we came to somehow value and um almost seek out more and more followers and friends on social media feeling like somehow that made us more connected but the nature of dialogue also changed like as human beings we evolved over thousands of years to not just understand the words someone is saying but to hear the tone of their voice to see their facial expression like you and I are sitting across and and we're both processing like our body language right and I'm seeing you nod your head and I'm seeing your eyes focused like all of that matters to how we communicate um but also like you and I are less likely to say something hurtful right now to one another because we can see each other if I said something to hurtful to you like i' probably see the the pain or consternation on your face and that might give me pause right when you're communicating online with other people without any of that information or with any of the uh sort of barriers if you will that make you pause before you hurt someone it leads to a very different kind of communication uh one that can be quite hurtful at times and I also think that one thing people many people don't recognize is that to communicate with somebody else and reach out and build a relationship with someone it actually takes a certain amount of self-esteem to do that you have to believe the other person's going to want to hang out with you they're going to see something valuable in you and for many young people what has happened uh and I think frankly for many older people too is their experience on social media has shredded their self-esteem as they constantly comparing themselves to other people like when you and I were growing up uh you know in the ' 80s we we compared ourselves to other people too right people have from Millennia but what's fundamentally different now is that in a given day you can compare yourself to thousands of images that you see online that's actually literally what people young people tell me I do roundtables with college students and high school students all the time around the country and the three things they tell me most consistently about their experience of social media is it makes them feel worse about themselves worse about their friendships but they can't get off it because the platforms are designed to maximize the amount of time they spend on them so you put all of this together and I think what has happened is that we're talking more but we understand each other less we have a lot of information but we're lacking in the wisdom that comes from Human Relationships uh and I think that that's really hurt us you know we see it certainly in the data that tells us about mental and physical health outcomes but there's also the human suffering component Andrew like it's really heartbreaking for me to travel around the country to hear hear from people of all ages often in quiet whispers about their struggles with isolation about how they feel like they just don't matter at all about how they feel like they just don't have a place where they belong and it's these are people on the outside look perfectly fine right they're posting happy things online to Folks at work they're seeming like everything's going great this is why I always tell people like you loneliness is a great masquerader it can look like withdrawal and sadness it can look like anger and irritability it can look like aloofness as well and so it's only when we stop to ask someone how they're doing when we take pause for a moment to maybe reflect on what's happening in their life that we realize that wow the majority of people in our country are actually struggling with loneliness yeah I'm a firm believer that "

            "text": "our nervous system evolved under conditions of close interpersonal and direct connection and um to suddenly throw a technology in front of ourselves that deprives our nervous system of its normal development is it's clearly going to lead bad places it's also um clear to me as based on what you just described that you know when we go on social media we see something but they don't really see us you know hence perhaps why people get um aggressive in the comment section um you know they they want to be heard yeah um we want to be seen I think all of us want to be seen and see other people yeah and uh social media doesn't allow for it so easily um I also so know that a lot of young people will congregate with their friends to play video games online but that's different you're you're essentially showing up as an avatar MH and when you when we were kids we also played different characters in our in our games um but oh so different now um do you think that there will be a youth Rebellion movement against um these kinds of Technologies I mean there's a long history of of young people rebelling against the the stuff that's been put in front of them and they're like nope no more we're going to Rebel in fact that was the way that youth overcame the um the nicotine e epidemic if you recall it was the advertising pitching them against or pitting them excuse me against um wealthy cackling older men in chair in rooms counting their money that was what actually was successful in getting kids to not smoke because kids have a rebellious streak as opposed to when they were told hey smoking is terrible for you your lungs are going to fill with cancer kids didn't stop smoking teens stop smoking it was you know Rebellion has been um baked into our nervous system uh in the Adolescent and teen years so do you see a rebellion against this um social isolation our kids going to start putting away their phones and hanging out together again and that's going to rescue us and that's a way of saying what can we do for them what can they do for themselves and what can we do as adults because there are a lot of um the silent suffering is the thing I also really worry about yeah so it's a good question and I think there is already uh a movement that's building among young people to create distance between them themselves and their devices and particularly social media and it it's it's cropping up in different ways I'm meeting more and more some of these are organized efforts but I'm also meeting more uh families uh where the parents and kids together have decided that they're going to delay using social media and you know till past middle school or in some cases even later or where they're deciding that they're going to draw boundaries around social media use or they're going to replace their smartphone with a dumb phone that allows them to do things like text and make phone calls and use maps and and all that stuff but doesn't necessarily have social media apps on it now this is still a small minority and and we're dealing with a bit of a network effect here right because if you're the only one who's not on social media uh in your middle school class then you might feel left out which is why it's so important for parents to and and kids actually do this together but I do think that to use your analogy with smoking that one thing that I I think many young people bristle against is this notion of being manipulated and used for the profit you know of a social media platform and the reality is that the again we've talked about how the fundamental business model is for most social media platforms is built on how much time you spend on those platforms that translates to ad revenue and that translates to the bottom line whereas what I care about as a parent as search in general is about how well that time is being spent is it actually contributing to the health and well-being of a young person or or is it not is it actually harming them and this is where I think when I go out and talk to young people about this number one I'm so impressed by a lot of young people because they they already have a lot of these insights they're the ones living it right they're not thinking that this is all you know perfect and and it's all a pure benefit here they're the ones telling me that it makes them feel worse about themselves and and their friendships but they also having a hard time getting off of it uh because again of how these platforms are designed so about a third of adolescence are saying that they're staying up till midnight or later on week nights using their devices and a lot of that is social media use and this takes away from sleep which we know and you know better than anyone is so critical to the mental health and well-being of all of us but of young people in particular who are at a critical phase uh you know of development um the other thing that is very concerning to me is nearly half of adolescents say that using social media has made them feel worse about their body image as they're constantly comparing themselves to others online and we used to think that this is just girls who are experiencing this and yes it is uh a lot of young girls who are experiencing these body image issues but now it's increasingly uh boys as well so this is happening across the board but the other piece I think that concerns me thinking about mental health symptoms is that you look at how much time uh kids are using social media on average adolescent are using it for three and a half hours a day on average so just social media just social media and that means many you're using it for far more than that and what you're finding though is that for adolescence who use it 3 hours or more in a given day their risk of anxiety or depression symptoms double right so and if they average uses three and a half days that means that millions of kids all across our country the majority of our kids are are at risk here and so you know you put all this together and and it paints a very concerning picture whatever benefits there may be for some kids of using social media and there's some and we lay out some of this in our advisory on social media some kids find social media is a great way to express themselves to reach other people to find support especially if they're from a community that doesn't have a lot of folks who like them around uh it can be really reassuring to connect with others but we can't say that just you know that to get those benefits we have to subject our children to all of these other harms right like kids are experiencing exposure to harmful content to harassment and bullying online six out of 10 uh adolescent girls are saying they've been approached by strangers on social media and ways that made them feel very uncomfortable um our kids are also finding that Health promoting activities in their lives are being cannibalized by their use of social media that it's detracting from time for Sleep inperson interaction physical activity and the erosion of self-esteem really concerns me as well because you know you need that not just for social interaction but like look as a as a father I want my children to grow up being confident about who they are being confident enough to be authentic as they up in the world to not feel like they need to create some brand that's different from who they fundamentally are just to sell that to the world I want them to know who they are and to be comfortable being who they are and to encourage other people to do the same to support them in their efforts to be authentic that's what I want my kids to do that's not what's happening to a lot of kids on social media so I think we not only need more kids to understand this and to support them in their efforts to create space and sacred spaces away from social media but we need to support parents here too cuz Andrew my big concern with parents is look we've taken this technology which is rapidly evolving which we didn't grow up with as kids and we've told parents you manage it all on your own we put the entire burden on parents and kids to manage this um you know when we were growing up you remember the motor vehicle fatalities were really high uh in America and we didn't say okay you know what that's just the price of Modern Life we just have to accept it and keep moving on with our lives we said hold on we don't have to go back to horses and Buggies but we also don't need to accept this death rate we need to make this experience safer and so we put in place with the advocacy and support of incredible groups like Matt and others across the country that me Mothers Against Drunk Driving ultimately the government put in place safety standards that got us seat belts airbags crash testing to make sure the frame of cars were robust in the setting of an accident and that help helped us reduce motor vehicle accidents and deaths and that's what we need here too like we need to have the backs of parents and kids and that means from a policy perspective putting in place safety standards to protect kids from exposure to harmful content from from the experience of bullying and harassment and that also protect them from features that would seek to manipulate them into excessive use uh which is happening far too often right now we also need a policy that requires data transparency from the company you know researchers tell us all the time that they these are independent researchers they tell us they are having a hard time getting full access to the data from the social media platforms about the full impact of the platforms on the mental health of kids and as a parent look I I don't when we bought car seats for my children when when they were born we looked up the safety data like many parents we wanted to make sure the car seats were safe but if you had told me that hey you know the manufacturers of these car seats are actually not disclosing some of the the data on the impact on children uh but go ahead and buy it anyway you know I'm sure other people are buying these car seats you should be fine I would have been very disturbed by that right no parent wants to feel that information is being hidden from them about the health impact of products on their kids that's what we have right now so this is a place where I think while yes uh and we we'll we should we'll talk about some steps parents can take because I want to get to practical steps of people who are here as parents or people have kids in their lives can take but we we we need policy makers to step up and step into the void here and to fill the Gap because this is too much again to just ask parents to manage entirely on their own and this isn't again about telling parents what to do and restricting them this is about giving them the support they need so they have confidence uh when they see uh you know a technology out there a device out there a product out there for kids that they know it's been tested that it's been studied and that it's actually safe for their children my understanding is that in uh countries like China there "

            "text": "are limit as to how many hours kids can be on screens period And when I was a kid we were allowed to watch TV for a certain number of I think it was a half an hour or an hour my mom was constantly kicking us out of the house like literally you got to leave the house you got to go down the street and play un fortunately I liked outdoor activities um nowadays we also have the issue that a lot of parents are on their phones at soccer games and at kids events and so the kids are modeling their parents yeah um parents are distracted as well so there's a lack of social connection people even an immediate family people are screened in um you know TV there's laptops there's multiple phones iPads people are you more engaged in the screen portals than often than their own portals you go to a concert and people are watching the concert through their screen so that they can send the same image that everyone around them is sending out to the world if you think about it's kind of crazy um but I guess they want to capture that unique experience but uh it's not unique at all that's the that's the myth that's the illusion there's nothing unique about the your post of something that you went to go see what would be truly unique is to just experience that in real time right it's so wild to think about like what we think of as our unique portal is actually not unique at all it's what we do with it learn on my my stance is glean and learn information online then go use it in real life come back from time to time you know maybe an hour a day maximum or so can I just underscore the two words you said real life because that I think is a really important key here which is that all of real life isn't happening on social media there's a whole world out there which I think is real life which is happening offline and what's happening online too often is distorted right it's giving us like like even just take um you know just take the images that that we see of people their uh you know their summer beach images their like great vacation images that's not representative of their entire life of how they're living their life but we see that we see people's anger we and their vital and we come to believe over time that that's how people feel that's what people are dealing with and experiencing their life and and we've just got to get you your mom I love what your mom did getting you guys outside um my parents did the same thing too like we I was very blessed to have two parents who didn't come you know they didn't have a lot of resources growing up they didn't come to this country with a lot of resources but the one of the greatest gifts they G gave us is that they loved us uncondition Al the other great gift that they gave us is they pushed us to just explore to meet people to learn about the world uh they wanted us outside playing you know experimenting just discovering the world you know riding our bike around the neighborhood and and that's what we did but right now two critical things that kids need for their mental health and development or two important forces I should say that are impacting their mental health and development one is social media but the second also is the lack of unstructured plate time uh that kids have like unstructured playtime is time when we as kids learn how to negotiate situations with other kids how to resolve conflict how to recognize what's going on in someone else's you know eyes before they say something we learn how to collaborate and play with other kids this a lot you learn on the playground as it turns out but I worry that right now that we've almost somehow made that kind of unstructured time seem inefficient you know we've set these standards uh for our kids that they need to be uh you know getting fancy jobs and into fancy colleges and making an x amount of money and the path to doing that is you know to be enrolled in X number of activities after school and to do all this stuff in school and their lives are so hyper structured um that I worry that the time to just play to be creative to reflect and think to just have unstructured time with other kids has evaporated and I think that that also is hurting the mental health and wellbeing of our children I love the idea that that unstructured play time could be framed in the accurate context of the nervous system developing the way it was supposed to develop I mean I would argue that um success is going to be easiest for children that engage in the real world more in fact there's great risk to posting everything that you do online we've seen some examples of that preventing people from getting into or staying in college based on things they said or did previously that they shouldn't have said or done um that's those are kind of you know negative highlighted cases but in general um we know that the the nervous system thrives on diversity of types of interactions and social interactions in particular I'm just restating what you just said so if ever there was a call for kids to get out into non-screen life let's call it um and engage uh their nervous system that way it without question is going to benefit them in terms of their ability to learn and retain information perform well in school which is not everything life's about but let's face it we still live in a society where hitting those milestones on a consistent basis are the best is the best predictor of people being able to you know live self-sustained lives build families and that sort of thing so um you mentioned a few actionable M uh "

            "text": "items for parents as it relates to kids maybe well not maybe limits their screen time force them outside in the safe weather and safe conditions of course but uh what about adults as well I what what can we all do um should we be restricting our screen time to X number of hours per today I mean you're the Surgeon General if you had a magic wand which I realize you don't um and you could make a uh a highly informed recommendation about what the thresholds for too much uh time on social media are um what would it be two hours three hours yeah it's it's a good question and let me actually go through some of these things that parents can can do for kids and that we can all do for ourselves with kids in particular um what I would do specifically with social media is and this is this is frankly what I'm planning to do with my wife for our kids as they grow up number one I would seek to delay the use of social media past Middle School uh at at minimum and I know that that is hard to do at a time where all kids are on social media and you don't want your child to be the only one left out and to be lonely as a result so that means no account of their own means no account of their own okay and I would make see to the best of your ability see if there are other parents that you can partner with to do this because it's hard to do alone as a parent but it's also if there are other parents you're partnering with that means there other kids who are also delaying you so that means your child is not alone and I think if you start the conversation with other parents you'll realize a lot of them are worried about the same things you are they may have thought about delaying you but they also don't want their kid to be the only one so this becomes a numbers challenge but partnership can help us if your child's already on social media what I'd recommend is to create sacred spaces in their lives that are technology free and specifically I would think about the hour before bedtime and throughout the night as time that you want to protect because kids are losing not just sleep because they're going to sleep later because they're on their devices but they're also waking up in the middle of the night maybe to use a bathroom maybe to get some water and then they get back on their devices again so the quality of their sleep is being significantly impacted by access to those devices during the night so I would protect that time hour before bed throughout the night I would also create make sure meal times uh were Tech free zone so that people actually that you talk to one another you see one another and time with friends and family members when you're out you know at a birthday party Etc make that Tech free time let them focus on their time with other people those three Tech free zones can do a world of good uh to help your child and then the last thing I'd recommend here the many things I think parents could do is to start a dialogue with your child about their use of social media um we don't always know how social media is making our kids feel uh from the and we may realize when we talk to them that they actually have their own concerns they might say yeah it's not making me feel really good but it's just like hard not to be on it everyone's like texting on this or everyone is uh you know everyone's you know sharing information and posting pictures on it I feel like I need to be on it you can only help them start to manage that if you know that that's a challenge that they're having so opening a conversation so your child knows that you're not judging them but you're trying to understand their experience is important also so you can help them understand what is not acceptable for them to experience on social media if they're being harassed or bullied by strangers uh that is a problem you want your child to to tell you about that to report that um if they see something posted online that's really concerning to them let's say they see a friend post that they're thinking of taking their own life or harming themsel in another way you want them to know that that's important to flag and to get help you know that they shouldn't just you know scroll past that so that conversation is really important and finally as parents we can lead by example right and this is hard because the truth is we've been talking about social media and youth and that's what the subject of my search and General's advisory was on but I have concerns about adults too I said as somebody who's had challenges in my own use you know of social media finding sometimes it bleeds you know past my bedtime and I'm realized you know I think m&a checked something for 5 minutes an hour later I'm still there you know scrolling through something uh and sometimes I you know you know I find myself over the years I found myself comparing myself also to posts I see online and unhealthy ways sometimes I find myself um sort of pulled into uh content uh that uh you know ends up being angry and vitriolic and leaves me feeling worse you know at the end so I've experienced this as well and I think as parents one of the hardest things to do is to follow this advice we're giving our kids to draw those boundaries as well and to put our devices away when we're around our kids uh one experience I had which sort of I still feel bad about but which really helped kind of knock some sense into me was after my my son was born uh my older child I was actually I was search in general at that time you know I had you know it was lot going on it was busy job Etc but I wanted to make sure that I protected bed times uh and meal times for us to be together as a family yet one day when I came home you know after dinner when we were doing the bathtime and bedtime routine getting my son ready uh for the night uh my wife was changing ing his diaper and instead of helping I was just standing at the side scrolling through my inbox and my wife who has infinite patience and is like one of the most well adjusted people that I know just paused and she turned to me and Alice said do you really need to be doing that right now and she said just very quietly but I felt this like such a sense of Shame when she did that because I was like what am I doing like this is my infant child you know and the rare few hours I have with them during the day and I'm just scrolling through my inbox in my phone like like this is terrible and look I know that all of us do this it maybe in different contexts but it was a wake up moment for me because I realized like one like as you know well as a neuroscientist we can't really multitask right we're rapidly task switching right and that was time in my when I head was in my inbox and my head wasn't with him you know and my heart wasn't with him right and I was just distracted and so as parents if we can honor those sacred times you know when we're with our children to keep our devices away meal times sleep time as well it's not easy to do but it really sets a good example for our kids um all Behavior change that we're talking about here the kind of behavior change I've worked with with patients over the years are physical activity and diet all of this is harder to do when we're doing it by ourself it's a lot easier to do do when we're we have a couple of friends or family members who we agree to do this with we hold each other accountable we encourage and support each other um it's how I've been able to make the most successful Behavior changes I've made in my life have come about because I have two good buddies uh Dave and sunny who are my my part of my brotherhood and the three of us as brothers talk about health we talk about our finances we talk about our family and our friendships and our failings and we help keep each other accountable and so I would just encourage parents like is this sounds daunting or overwhelming you don't have to do this alone think about one or two people other parents who you might want to do this with and I guarantee you there a lot of us are struggling with the same stuff and they would probably welcome an opportunity to do this in collaboration with another parent such spectacular advice that I hope everyone will follow not just for their kids but for themselves I think that whether or not social media is addictive in the in the true sense of the word is is kind of meaningless debate at this point it's at the very least a compulsive behavior for many of us and as you described it in example you gave it becomes reflexive yes we're just you know we're not necessarily seeking pleasure or looking to to engage in online battles it's just it's become reflexive sort of like finding yourself with your hand in the refrigerator just you even think about it you're just doing it so becoming more conscious of the use uh and thereby more conscious of the value of putting away the screens and social media for extended periods of time each day and certainly in the middle of the night folks neuroplasticity brain rewiring happens in the middle of the night while you're asleep and I this when you mentioned kids awake in the middle of the night looking at their phone I just I saw you Flinch oh my goodness it pains me and I've looked at my phone in the middle of the night I try not to but um but I'm certainly not in the window of Maximum plasticity either it's terrible for everybody but especially terrible for kids um what you just provided is an incredible "

            "text": "let's just call it a I'll call it a mandate you didn't say it but a suggestion of of teaming up with people um to become more like-minded around these issues and to really promote health I along those lines I I really want to thank you um first of all for the conversation today you're incredibly busy you're responsible for uh an entire country is worth of um people so to take time to sit down with me and to discuss these topics for our audience is it incredible appreciated by me and and and by them I I feel comfortable extending their gratitude here and uh it's also clear based on today's conversation that you face an enormous number of challenges at the level of budgetary challenges by the way I'm going to work on that um it's hard to shut me up um as well as the the huge array of of issues that you confront and um and it's clear that it's a challenge that you've embraced for many years now under difficult conditions and that you're clearly willing to get out and talk to people and hear their criticism hear their concerns hear um and learn from them and so it's been of great benefit to us to hear and learn from you and I hope this won't be the the last of our conversations there's many more topics to cover but I just really want to thank you thanks ever so much for the the the intellectual power uh and the emotional power that you put into what you do cuz that is very clear you're a physician first and you care about your patients and your patients are all of us so thank you so much Andrew that's for me just incredibly kind of you I thank you I appreciate that and I've loved our conversation and you know for me what what I hope most of all for my kids for our country more broadly is that is that we can go deeper like beneath this these surface issues I I worry that we find ourselves disagreeing about and fighting about online and recognize that there is a deeper challenge that we are facing that I think underlies a lot of uh these the anger and the vitrio and this issue around how disconnected we become from one another I think is at the heart of that I don't think that there's any policy or program we can Implement that's going to ultimately fix what Al Society without fundamentally realizing that a lot of this is a manifestation of a society that has become more disconnected and More disinvested in one another like over time and that's just not who we are it's not how we evolved over thousands of years it's not how we're going to thrive in the future so I know that sometimes when you look at these big intractable problems uh like widespread loneliness in the United States that it can seem like hard to address these but I do want to encourage everyone to to recognize that when it comes to human connection that it is small steps that can make a big difference because we are hardwired to connect as human beings and if you if you just pause for a moment and if you just think for a moment in your own life about someone who has been there for you during a time of great need somebody who has stood up for you and you couldn't stand up for yourself someone who's helped to remind you of why you're still a good person why you still have worth and value to add to the world even when you had lost faith in yourself you think about their faith in you about their support for you about their love for you think about how healing that was that's the power that we have to help each other heal we are going through an identity crisis in many ways as a country where I think we need to ask ourselves who are we like what defines who we are what are the set of values that we want to guide us in our life to guide our country and I know that it feels like We're a nation of people who are mean who only care about ourselves who are throwing blame and anger at each other all the time who are pessimistic about the future but I actually don't think that's really who we are I think at our heart we are hopeful and optimistic people I think in our true nature we are kind and generous to one another um in our hearts we we we're interdependent creatures who recognize that if someone else is suffering we want to be out there to support them uh and who want to want people to be there to support us as well that's who who we really are but we have to to make a Clear Choice here about our identity you know as as individuals and as a country and recognize that that choice has real implications for everything else that we're talking about here that's the foundation and when I think about my own kids growing up like like many parents I worry about the world uh that that they're coming into um I I worry that they're going to use the wrong word even though their intentions are right and people are going to blame them or cast them out you know I worry that they're going to stumble and fall down and people are just going to keep walking by not caring you know because everyone's living their own life I worried that they might become someone who does the same thing to other people right none of which I want but I want for all of our kids is for them to grow up in a society where we care about one another we have each other's backs we recognize as that old African proverb goes that we can go fast if we go alone but if we really want to go far we go together and that's what I want for my kids in our country but that's what we each have the power to create in our own lives it starts with the decisions we make but how we treat one another do we for example reach out for 5 minutes a day to someone that we care about do we pick up the phone and call them to say hey I'm thinking about you we can all do that today do we give people the benefit of our full attention recognizing that while time is scarce our attention has the ability to stretch time it can make five minutes feel like half an hour but it's a hard thing for people to get because they're distracted by their devices but do we give people the benefit of our full attention and do we look for ways to serve one another recognizing that it's through our acts of service that we actually Forge powerful con actions but we also remind ourselves how much value we have to bring to the world and this is important in a time when the self-esteem of so many of us and our young people in particular is being eroded uh particularly by their use of social media so these are the steps that we can take to build Connection in our life but the core values I believe that have to be at the heart of our identity these values around kindness and generosity around courage and service these also have to animate the decision decisions that we make in our life about programs we advocate for the policies we support the leaders we choose they should all be reflections of the values that we want to see in our children and in society more broadly because I'll tell you that 90% plus of the decisions leaders make they make behind closed doors and what's guiding them in those moments are their values that's true whether you're the leader of a company uh or a nonprofit organization uh or a leader in government so those values matter and I want us as a country to speak more about the values that we choose about the identity uh that we want to Anchor ourselves to um that's the way in which I feel like America can be an even greater Beacon uh of Hope for the world because the world is struggling with this too we're not the only ones who are dealing with loneliness and isolation who are seeing anger uh and resentment and vitri all bubble up uh at extraordinary levels we're seeing mistrust in institutions soore U many countries are experiencing this I would love America to lead the way in some ways in showing what it's like to embrace a more human identity that's centered around kindness and service and friendship uh and generosity like to me all of these values ultimately Andrew stem from love right love is our greatest source of power it's our greatest source of healing uh I say that as a Doctor Who's prescribed many medicines over the years but there few things more powerful uh then love and its ability to help us through difficult times and help mend the wounds seen and unseen uh that we all carry with us and I think if we recognize that we recognize that you know we don't have to have an MD after our name uh or have gone to nursing school to be healers we all have the power to help each other heal like Andrew we are not fundamentally a nation of bystanders who just stand by while other people suffer like We're a nation of of healers and hop makers who can restore hope that the future can be better who can create a better life for ourselves and the people around us right now it's what we're capable of it's what we're built for that's the identity that I think we now more than ever need to embrace amen and thank you for that um I agree love is definitely the verb that can get us where we need to go thank you so much for your words for your um incredible efforts to support public health and uh hopefully to continue to support Public Health uh I know you've been at this a long time um and we've all benefited and um and thanks for your open-mindedness uh especially around some of the questions that invoke some Challenge and again for your taking the time to come talk with us today and uh I really also enjoyed it it's it's been a real pleasure and there was a lot of learning for me and um like I said before uh I hope it won't be the last time I hope not either no I look forward to the next time to staying in touch and uh just love this conversation thank you for what you've done for being this beautiful channel of information for the public but it's most more thank you for who you are you know like who you're Andrew like comes across very clearly uh you know when I meet you you just you have a good heart and you have good intentions you're man and we need more people like you in the world thank you right back at you thank you for joining me for today's discussion with "
