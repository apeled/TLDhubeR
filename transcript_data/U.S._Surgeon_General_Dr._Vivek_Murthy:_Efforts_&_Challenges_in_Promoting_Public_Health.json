            "text": "in government this was not part of some5 10 30 year plan uh when I was a a kidI was interested in medicine but Ialways thought I was going to practicemedicine you know like my dad did andlike my like the clinic my mom ran youknow set up put up a shing sing Le seepatients and uh be a primary care doctorand and feel good about the work I wasdoing but what happened to me along theway is uh you know I I trained inmedicine I got interested in technologyspent seven years building a technologycompany uh that was focused on health Igot I was I became increasingly worriedabout the way we were deliveringHealthcare and it felt like ourhealthare system was broken people whoneeded care couldn't get it it was oftentoo expensive to get care we werefocusing on treatment solely and notenough on prevention so I startedgetting involved in in advocating for aBetter Health Care system with doctorsaround the country when despite all thatI still never thought I would work ingovernment but in 2013 uh is whenPresident Obama's team had reached outto me and asked if I'd be interested inconsidering the position of SurgeonGeneral and what was interesting to meabout this position is it's actuallyvery different from most positions uhthat are appointed by President andgovernment and that it's supposed to bean independent position so my agenda theissues I choose to take on are notdetermined by a president or a partythey're determined by science and thepublic interest uh and that's what'swhat guides me you know and that's whatthat's what guided me in that first termwhen I served and when President Bidenasked me to come back and serve asSurgeon General a second time that'swhat's guided me here too um so Biden umis not sending you notes saying heycould you put some effort into uh youknow getting messages out about you knowCo or could you put more effort into umgetting your team over to Maui to dealwith the you know the you know thetragedy there and which is a long Arctragedy right we get the news in a in ain a blast of this happened and then thenext blast comes in about something elseand we forget that there are physicaland mental health crises that areongoing um and and then I have toimagine then start to overlap with oneanother or is it so is it your decisionum where and how to deploy the financialand and Human Resources like okay we'regoing to put 10 people on Maui yeahwe're going to um put uh you know fivepeople in the Central States you knowgoing around talking to um majororganizations about what they need to doto prepare for this winter is that howit works or are you getting memos and umin other words who's your boss everyonehas a boss at some level mine are is arethe listeners of of this podcast at somelevel I work for them it used to also bemy bulldogum but my my boss my wife and my twokids who are five and seven they I dowhat they tell me to got it got it so umbut how we make our decisions in theoffice actually it's a bit different uhwith those two roles so on with with thesecond one with overseeing thecommission Corp our 6,000 officers theythe the decisions about how and when wedeploy officers are collaborative rightso I you know we work with othercolleagues throughout the Department ofHealth and Human Services we work withpeople in FEMA across the administrationbut we also work with States sosometimes states often often States willput in a request and say hey we needsupport here uh can you help so we'llwork with colleagues across ourdepartment to say okay well we canmobilize our commission core officerswhat assets can you mobilize and thencollectively we will send a team outthere so for example we have officershelping in Maui right now uhparticularly with mental health needs uhwhich are I worry only going to continueto grow over the weeks and months aheadon the other side of the house when whenit comes to deciding which issues weengage with the public on like in thiscase mental health has been a big Focusuh area for me on on that front well wecertainly you know are open tosuggestions from the public members ofCongress sometimes say hey can you helpthe public understand about this issueyou know a lot of people have ideas andopinions but the decision about whichissues to focus on those are our officesuh and to me that's important becausepart of the reason over time I believethe public came to have some degree offaith and trust in the office office isbecause they hope that the office wasfunctioning the way you hope your doctoris functioning which is being anindependent source of information foryou uh and a source that has your bestinterest at heart that's not beingpulled aside by political interests orby other agendas but the primary agendais how can I help your health and so forme like we have to make an independentassessment there and say okay where isthe need uh the greatest tier where canwe make the biggest difference sometimeswe may not build an initiative on anissue and that doesn't mean that thatISU is not important or that it's notaffecting a lot of people but we have tomake hard decisions about where to putlimited resources and so when I was aSurgeon General the the first time oneof the big areas I focused on was theopioid crisis uh that we were dealingwith as well as the E ecigarette useamong youth because we were seeing adramatic increase uh among kids inecigarette use that was can I just askyou sorry to interrupt but I think it'srelevant here um has that increasecontinued or ecigarette use AKA vapingyeah yeah so we still see unfortunatelythere there's been some improvements butwe still see way too many kids who areusing uh vaping devices early on andpart of what we did from our office isrecognizing that we actually issued thefirst Federal report on ecigarettes andyouth uh we call the country's attentionto the fact that this is a crisis weworked with members of Congress uh totalk about the kind of action we neededuh from a legislative and Regulatoryperspective and worked with colleaguesat the FDA and in government as well butthere are two things that are reallymost important in guiding our choiceabout priorities uh one is data we lookat what the numbers actually tell usabout the impact these issues are havingon the population as well as thetrajectory of Rise if something'sgetting dramatically worse and peopledon't realize it might be an area for usto focus but the other critical factoris what I hear from people on the roadso I try to spend as much time as I canvisiting communities across the countrydoing Town Halls meeting with uhcommunity members and just trying tofrankly just listen to what's on theirmind and that's where I actually get alot of information as well that telllike that's actually how I came to focuson the issue of loneliness and isolationit wasn't because it popped up in areport uh as being uh the the leadingpublic health issue in the country itwas because everywhere I was going in20142015 whether I was talking to collegestudents talking to retired Americanstalking to parents in rural areas andurban areas I kept hearing these storiesabout people who felt like they were ontheir own or they felt invisible or theyfelt if they disappeared tomorrow no onewould even care or they felt like theyjust didn't belong and it'sheartbreaking to hear that from anyoneit's particularly heartbreaking to hearit from kids uh who you hope areentering life and looking forward towhat comes uh but many kids weren'tfeeling thatway that is very useful context and wewill get back to the isolation um crisis"

            "text": "um such an important initiative thatthat um I just will thank you now forhaving put out the the message on socialmedia and elsewhere um about that umbecause I think one of the questions Ihave in light of what you just said isit's clear that you got your ear to theground you're talking to differentpeople um it's also critically importantthat people hear from you and know umnot just what's happening but that youperhaps want to know what uh you knowwhere the issues lie and what the umwhat the actionable steps are thatpeople can take right and I think thatwe now live in a hyperconnected world umso you know in fact I'll just say thatone of the reasons I launched thispodcast is in 2020 I was going onpodcast talking about things likemaintaining sleep and circadian rhythmand stuff from my lab related to tryingto um adjust anxiety under underconditions where I think everyone wasanxious and sleep rhythms were disruptedEtc um and I was somewhat surprised thatthat I didn't get a warning on my phonehey make sure you're getting morningsunlight you know like I I'll get aflood warning uh you know I'll get awarning that I might get a warning butit's only a test warning I'll get threeof those yesterday living here near thecoast but um I don't think once duringthe pandemic did I get a email or apublic service announcement saying heyyou know if you are going to be indoorsa lot you're going to have to be mindfulof maintaining your circadian rhythmbecause if you're not I we know based onhundreds of studies now that drifts andcircadian rhythmicity are a precursor tomental health issues I mean in factthere's a new idea that many not allsuicides um are preceded by a period ofdisrupted sleep which is you know kindof makes sense in in um and it's not uhcausal of course but how come during thepandemic we each and all as US citizensdid not getan email or a text message saying heythese are five things that you need todo every day to try and stay as stableas possible in this very uncertainlandscape that we're in well it's areally good question and and I thinkit's a it's areasonable and a very good suggestion tosay that hey look there should be aclear and comprehensive way that we canget messages out to everyone um like ifwe were working in a hospital system andthere was a safety issue that came upthere would be an email sent to all thehospital staff members saying hey thisis something you need to be aware ofright so I think it's a reasonableexpectation uh practically if you goback though over the last 20 30 yearsfor on a on health issues there hasn'tbeen sort of an agency or an entity thathas sent emails out to everyone first ofall how to send an email out to everyonein America is not a simple propositioneither technically it's challengingthere's some legal issues you'd have todeal with as well but you could do anight where you go CNN Fox NBC ABC NewYork Times Wall Street like you couldhit the right the the right wi the leftwing and everything yeah that's a reallyinteresting suggest like one but one onevideo just where they all agree like heythis is important information so aapolitical like no yeah so I would saythat that kind of messaging I would saythrough traditional media certainly hashappened you know and it happened duringcoid uh it happened for example when umyou know during the first year of coid Iwas a private citizen you know in theprivate private Administration but I youknow I watched both then and at thebeginning of the the BidenAdministration um many officials wouldgo out in front of cameras and say hereare three things you need to do to keepyourself safe uh you know from from coidas and that was a big question peoplehad how do I keep myself safe okay hereare three things you can do a couple ofchallenges I would say here is thatnumber one even if you hit all the majorNetwork and cable news showsyou're still not reaching everyone rightbecause we're living in a in a societywhere increasingly people are notwatching TV right they're getting theirnews from other sources um the otherthing uh that's important to know isthat attention shifts quickly you knowin traditional media also from issue toissue and so you might get a clip youknow out at a certain uh day or youmight get on all the Sunday shows forexample but the next day you know thatmessage isn't necessarily there you knowit's it's gone and people's attentionhas also switched off too so there wereI mean I can count and you know we'velogged probably thousands of interviewsat this point that we've done withmainstream media with sort of you knowconcise messages about three things youcan do to protect yourself Etc and youknow I'm glad we did those we got to dothem but I think one of the things wethey don't we don't have right now inthe country and this is an I think a bitof an Health infrastructure challenge iswe actually don't have a quick efficientway to reach everyone in the countrywith a health message just like what youyou said you know what if you wanted toget that message about three things toprotect yourself from let's say coid orthree things to do to you know supportyour health and well-being during a timeof Crisis or during a time of Health Imean again like not just the floodwarning but the the the daily because II do think that most of mental andphysical health is the result of dailypractices that are you know that buildon themselves sort of like compoundingcompounded Investments and then ofcourse there are acute challenges andchronic challenges that people face butthings of that sort too I I I thinkthose kind of messages in time of Healthare are absolutely important as well anduh you know I think I think in the sortof I think fast-paced crisis-drivenenvironment that we live in uhunfortunately people are often less arepaying less attention to thosemaintenance and Improvement messagesthan they are to managing the crisismessages but I think that they'reequally as important but I do think thatwhat you're pointing out is aninfrastructure piece that that needs tobe built which is a way for uh you knowHealth authorities to reach people youknow with information quickly andcomprehensively uh I'll just tell youthat in the 1980s when C ever coup wasSurgeon General one thing that he haddone done which was interesting is hehad actually sent a letter a physicalletter uh to all households in Americaabout HIV a physical letter a physicalletter some of our listeners won't knowwhat that is yeah so thing you readabout in the history books or somethingshows up in your mailbox and you open itand um hopefully something you want toread this Cas this case he was worriedabout HIV about the fact that peopledidn't know about it so he workedthroughan with as I understand it with a memberof Congress found you know a way to dothis from a funding perspective but itwas a very unusual move uh and one thatwas never replicated since and there wasnever infrastructure or funding to dothat again um when I was Surge Generallast time you know you know some yearsago and then this time around one of thethings I did do is I was able ble tosend a physical letter to the medicalcommunity uh the first time it was aboutthe opioid use crisis and about changingour prescribing practices in medicine sothat we expose fewer patients to theharm of opioids while making sure peoplewho needed them actually got them andthe second time it was about coidTherapeutics it was about making surethat when we had data about medicinesthat actually work like paid that we mayactually offered them to patients madethem available to patients because wewere realizing that many people weren'tgetting offered life-saving mediciations even though they were in highrisk groups um so we were able to findyou know and we had to again there twohad to sort of creatively Cobbletogether resources funding this is allsort of you know sort of behind thescenes government stuff but the thebottom line is in in what you want in anemergency uh and what you want I thinkin the long term is a simple clearcomprehensive way that public healthmessages can get out to people and tothis day what we still have to rely onare one traditional channels like youknow traditional media to cover theinitiatives we put out whether it's onsocial media and youth mental health oron loneliness or on youth mental healthmore broadly uh we will have to rely ononline channels uh which which we do aswell or we have to look to creativePartnerships that we build with peoplewho reach different audiences and thentogether uh we try to get out messagesour office does all three uh of thesebut uh it's a patchwork uh and and youknow and it's not always ideal but it'swhat we do now I think part of what thisreflects is a broader challenge like in"

ofneuroplasticity that drives increasedappetite and changes the response tohealthier food so that they don't tasteas as satiating okay that's sort of aduh to a lot of people but I think itwas an important set of findings becauseit said the brain actually changes inresponse to the um the very uh Richflavorful foods that are associated withwith highly processed or even moderatelyprocessed foods okay I meanum that's just a couple of studies umthere was nothing in those studies thatsaid if you eat these Foods you're goingto develop cancer but you know at somepoint one has to as a citizen ataxpaying citizen speaking on behalf ofmany other taxpaying citizens I have tosort of take a step back and say howlong do we wait right do we have to geta randomized clinical trial about theyou know the you know the five 100,000sick kids that grow into sickadults um and then run a trial wherethey go on a an Elimination Diet wherethey're eating only unprocessed vegan orunprocessed meat and vegetable orunprocessed you know starch andvegetable but I mean I mean then we'retalking about a 30-year Health crisisbefore we intervene why not I mean if Iwere in charge which I'm not and clearlyI wouldn't survive in a governmentorganization because um well I've gotthe uniform down um I always wear thesame thing but um a uniform but Iwouldn't because I would want to saywait you know why not a on the side ofcaution why not send out this AIgenerated text message that tellseverybody in all the languages thatAmericans speak and can understand heyyou get to make choices about what youeat but you should be aware that ummaking your diet comprised of more than15 to 20% of these Foods is potentiallygoing to lead to serious issues down theroad and those serious issues areextremely serious I mean the Obesitycrisis is really a crisis of both bodyand brain metabolic challenge um that wecan talk about so you know who sets thethresholds you know in other words whyis it that in this country we have towait until people start to get reallysick and dying and really strugglingbefore something is done in thedirection of their health and I'm notblaming you I just want to understandbecause um good question the the wealthypeople I know care a lot about theirfood sources and they pay a lot ofattention to it and why aren't weallowing everyone the opportunity tomake better choices so this is the rightquestion and this is something I I thinkabout a lot because I'm conscious aboutwhat I eat but I also talk to folksaround the country and realize a lot ofpeople don't have either the informationuh or the resources to actually purchasehealthy food right and to know likewhat's going to be good for them and fortheir families this is why you know Imentioned we have a list of issues thatyou know we would work on you know if wehad more more more resources this isactually one of them because to me oneof the most common questions people askis what should I eatthat's simple but it's it's vexing it'scomplicated it's incredibly confusing ifyou go online and just try to search forinformation and it's a classic exampleof where it's important to have anobjectivescientific Authority that can come andthen speak on Broad principles arounddiet that can talk about what we knowand don't know so here's important thingI think a lot of times people may seesomething as uh you know on the marketthey might read list of ingredients theydon't recognize how of them becausethey're additives but they figure wellif it's there then it must have beenstudied for 30 40 years and there mustbe no harmful consequences right butsometimes things are are put out therebecause we have short-term data thatsays that they're okay and there mightbe uh but there may be a need for morelong-term data helping people understandwhat do we know what do we not know isimportant so that people can makedecisions for themselves based on howmuch risk they want to take the otherthing that that concerns me here Andrewis I look I I have I'll tell you I havea bias here and my bias is that I amworried about the you know additives andother products we have in food thatdon't have long-term data uh that'sclear in terms of health risk and sobecause of that like my bias isgenerally to think how can we get peopleuh you know minimally or less processedfoods and how can we get them morefruits and vegetables how can we makesure that they have that more availableto them but we've got to not only makethe information available but we have tomake it accessible from a costperspective if you don't have a grocerystore in your community if vegetablesand fruits cost 3x what other foods dothat's going to be a problem right tochange diet the other thing we have tokeep in mind is that you know foodcompanies you know a lot of them do agreat job of actually trying to gethealthy nutritious food out to peopleyou know and kudos to them but I worryalso that there's an incentive also tojust try to sell more and more and moreof your product and one of the ways todo that is to try to hack uh the body tokind of figure out okay well what kindof synthetic additives could I puttogether here or what kind of uhcombination of nutrients could I puttogether that will get people comingback for more and more and more and wesaw this in the nicotine industry yousaw the Nick industry you also I wouldsay another parallels you see it insocial media as well where the businessmodel of the social media platforms isbuilt on volume of use right how muchtime am I spending on the platforms it'snot quality of time it's quantity oftime right so if that's the businessmodel then you're going to design yourplatform to Max maximize how much timesomeone spends on them regardless ofwhether it's detracting from sleepdetracting from inperson interactiondetracting from anything else it'shealthy regardless of whether that maybe causing certain harms right like thebusiness model dictates you know in manyways how these things are designed andthat applies I think to food as well sowhich is why I think it's incumbent uponus to be particularly cautious uh withhighly processed foods foods that foodsthat have additives and to understandhow is this impacting our brain how isthat impacting our satietyhow is it um leading potentially toGreater ingestion that is healthy andleading to things like obesity whichhave a whole host of other medicalconditions from cancer to arthritis todiabetes and heart disease associatedwith it those are the questions as a asa citizen as a father of two young kidswho's trying to bring them up at with ahealthy lifestyle those are thequestions that I would want to know theanswers to and it's one of the reasons Ithink these kind of objective reportsare so important for thepublic I'm starting to see the the scopeof the problem and the mechanicsinvolved in trying to alleviate theseissues are complex I I I I see that theyare also one other thing that isimportant to do that so is you need tohaveauthorities that can speak to theseissues that are insulated from politicalretribution right so and to explain thislike Amen to that yeah I mean listen assomebody forgive me for interrupting butsomebody who from time to time will ummake not recommendations but we'll offerinformation about potential actionableitems you know things that people coulddo or not do according to a couple ofstudies that come have come out I meanhave come under intense scrutiny from mycolleagues um who are like wait that'snot a randomized control trial how canyou do that and yet I know from being inthis field for a long time that forinstance the emerging therapies for forPTSD and depression that are now basedon federal funding for things like umand I'm not recommending this by the wayfor children or for everybody but forinstance the um macro do psilocybintherapeutically supported uh legal useof psilocybin for for uh majordepression the data there are they'renot perfect but they're pretty darn goodcompared to the majorssris um but for years if if an academicsaid the the words I just said they'dlose their job almost instantaneouslybecause they're Controlled Substances umthat's a that's a Todo but then thereare a number of things that we'retalking about here that are just aboutmaking better choices about things toavoid right if people understood I thinkthat um is sugar poison well some of myaudience will say sugar is poison it'sas addictive as cocaine look it is notas addictive as cocaine or heroin it isnot however if a child or adult iseating very sweet or very Savory Foodsof any kind consistently if those arenot um healthy foods or if they are ifthey contain unhealthy additives overtime the brain will rewire so thathealthy foods don't taste is good theywon't be the choices that people makeand you're going to end up with a sickindividual period And I don't think weneed one more clinical trial funded byfederal tax dollars to support thatstatement what I'm starting to gather isthat you're a very rational groundedbroad thinkinking individual I'm notjust saying that because you're sittinghere and you're trained in medicine andyou understand the science uh but thatyou don't have the means at yourdisposal to put out a call that says heyfolks having some sugar every once in awhile treating the kids to ice creamgreat but if 80% or more of the diet itof our kids isn't made up of minimallyor non-processed Foods their brains aregoing to be rewired in unhealthy waysand you can almost expect that they'regoing to have some Health Challenge inthe future that may not be um you knowautism or schizophrenia but is going tobe a major Health Challenge of a andthat is serious and Now's the Time tointervene by avoiding certain things andif you don't want to do it look it's afree country at that level you'rewelcome to do it but you'd be better offspending X number of dollars on thesehealthier foods yeah because there'salso and we know this from my colleagueAli crum's laboratory at Stanford thateven the mere knowledge that certainfoods are nutritious can lead to moresatiety from eating those Foods at thelevel of hormone release not justpsychologically you're telling yourselfthe Orange is as tasty and and fillingas a candy bar but the understanding ofof the fact that it is nutritiousactually leads to shifts in patterns ofof you know grillin secretion Etc thatthat change so people can be feel betteron a healthier slightly lower calorienutrient enrich diet of healthy proteinsand fruits and vegetables and it's not amind trick it's it's physiology anyway II I think um I I feel your pain franklyand I'll tell you look sometimes people"

Etc here'sactually why like I know in today's dayand age it's easy to just go and likerattle off off you know off the cffstatements or shoot from the Welcome onmy social media channels anytime andreally to get the word out to millionsof people I appreciate that and I maytake you up on that but I'll tell youthat one of the reason one of the thingswe always do recognizing that when weput out statements that people peopleone they they trust it's coming from ascientific Authority and that it's beenvetted right so we put the effort andtime into vetting this thoroughly wecheck sources we look at the data wetalk to experts we think about how tocommunicate this in the right way that'sthe work the behind the scenes work sureuh that we do before we put out sort ofreports and and initiatives because wewant people to have confidence you knowin in what they're hearing we also knowthat when we put out initiatives thatother people build on themphilanthropists you know and andfoundations will then think about shouldI fund work in this area uh you knowschools and workplaces will think aboutshifting some of their practice policymakers will also think about legislationuh that they may uh want to design basedon that so we want to make sure it it'sreally solid but the point I was makingwhen I said also that we have to makesure that not just our office but folkswho are you know in public health andwho are in medicine who are trying tospeak to the public about their healththat they're protected from retributionand taxes this is what I meant which isthat saying things about diet sayingthings abouttobacco these can be challenging forsome folks because there are Industriesbuilt around these right which may notalways like what you have to say uh ifit hurts their business model or theirbottom line and they may then lean on umpolitical leaders elected leaders othersto then try to silence you or or shutyou up and I'll tell you I'veexperienced this in the past you knowwhen I was Surgeon General during myfirst term I had issued two uh keyreports one was on alcohol drugs andhealth about the addiction crisis uh andthe other was about the ecigarettecrisis among youth I will tell you thatthere were plenty of people who werevery unhappy that I was issuing theFirst Federal report on ecigarettes umfolks who felt that hey um this is goingto make folks unhappy it's going tocreate political pressure uh it's goingto create a lot of problems uh similarlywith alcohol drugs and health there aremany folks who said hey if you do thisyou're really going to upset the AL alolindustry do you really need to havealcohol in the report why don't you justfocus on other drugs um why don't youtake alcohol out of the title you knowall of these sort of you know concernstelling you this who so these are peoplewho get paid by the alcohol industry nothese are people in government who arereading the te leaves and who who aresupportive of the work we're doing butare saying hey like you're going toreally upset a lot of people in industryand you're also going to help a lot ofpeople yeah well this is what it comesdown to they say well and if you upsetfolks then they're going to try to fireyou they're going to try to do all thesethings to which honestly like my myresponse to a lot of these and thereason we just put them out anyway wasbecause I said well the worst thing thatcan happen is I get fired and that'sokay you know if I if I go out knowing Idid the right thing here then I'm finewith that I'm not looking to build alifelong career in government I'm notdoing this job to like you know get tothe next thing on the ladder like thisis about serving for the time I can Iwant to be able to go to sleep at nightlook myself in the mirror and know I didso with Integrity um so that was an easydecision for me but but my point is thatlike we have to be thoughtful that inthese issues that there are going to beheadwinds right I'm sure in your casefor example you've probably gotten pushback from folks about talking aboutcertain things that may have rankledfolks who may have had an interest inthose issues and that's okay you keeptalking about them as as you should andI'm grateful for that um but this isespecially important at a time where Ithink public trust in our institutionsmore broadly and in science and inmedicine medicine have taken a hit overthe last few years and I think it's atime where we have to be even moreVigilant those of us in medicine andpublic health to make sure that what wedo is based on data that we'retransparent about why we're saying whatwe're saying that we're also clear aboutwhat we know and what we don't know sothat if recommendations change over timepeople recognize that this isn'tnecessarily flip-flopping you shouldchange your recommendations if the datachanges uh if the circumstances changeso uh anyway this is all part of thework that we've got to do but to me thisis a really important part of the workthe Integrity behind our work in publichealth is not just about the issue we'retaking on today it's about the trustthat we need to rebuild uh in the fieldmorebroadly so if I understandcorrectly if you were to for instance uh"

as anyonewho's been around teenagers there hasbeen one you make that mistake onceyou're not making it again and you maynever recover from that particularexample in other words the public feltlike

do but there wasn't a lotof um kind of acknowledgment of of howchallenging the situation was it wasjust a lot of top downmandates and in my opinion and this isjust my opinion I think that led to apretty rapid distrust of subsequentmessages from which we still haven'treally recovered um andso why do you think it's so challengingfor public facing officials to just saylook doing the best we can at the momentscrewed upbefore changing the message now maychange again we're navigating this in inreal time it's Dynamic yeah please staywith us because you know goes withoutsaying there's been a huge Chasm aroundthis and related issues yeah look thisit's an important question and look II'm always I want to be thoughtful aboutum you know how I comment on what wasdone in the first year of the pandemic Iwas I was a citizen I was outsidegovernment and I don't know what washappening inside government in terms ofthe the decisions that were made madethere but I do know sometimes from myexperience in Ebola and in zika duringthose uh experiences we had as a countrythat in the you know in the fog of Warwhen everything's coming at yousometimes it's hard to make the rightdecision all the time right so I I wantto give some of those folks who werethere uh you know in the first year ofthe pandemic you know some benefit ofthe doubt but I do think that theimportant thing uh the principle I Icertainly try to follow but one I thinkthat uh and you know we can all dobetter I Can Do Better certainly too uhbut I think an important principle forus in public health communication has tobe that we'reclear that we're transparent about whatwe know and what we don't know uh andthat we explain the why to people so ifwe're telling someone to do somethingwhy is it because there's a lot of databehind it is it because it's a sort ofexpert agreement best practice becausesometimes as you know in in medicinesometimes when we don't have enough datato guide us on on a therapeutic approachbut when the problem is imminent thensometimes experts will get together andput together expert inform formedguidelines to say okay look based on ourbest judgment and the limited data wehave here's what we would recommend andas the data evolves we will change youknow and and modify thoserecommendations we do that withhypertension right you evolve and updaterecommendations we do that with lipidsum here too I think that has to be likea key part of the approach I think oneof the challenges that I saw many publichealth officials encounter was even whenthey went out with Comprehensivemessages like that uh which are hard tofit into a sound bite or into simpleposts on social media um often a lot ofthat wasn't covered what gets covered isthe Top Line you know this is what'sbeing recommended that's what's beingrequired Etc all the explanation is lostit's missing right and I think we alsoare living in a time where people arereading headlines like they're livingbusy lives right they're notnecessarily you know always hearing allof the Nuance you know that's beingexplained um but I think that that's achallenge right is like I know manypublic officials struggled with how doyou deliver nuanced information uh at atime when there isn't a clear black andwhite answer to things but I think thelast piece around this is um I thinksomething I was taught early in medicalschool is to approach your patients withhumility recognizing that even thoughyou have more training than they do uhyou don't aren't living their life youdon't necessarily know what they'regoing through and you shouldn't assumeum things about them right and soapproaching with humility means that umyou've got to recognize that noteveryone's going to be able to followyour guidance and if they aren't able tothat doesn't mean you criticize them italso means recognizing that people mayhave ideas or suggestions for you thatmay actually improve yourrecommendations or how you communicateand so I these are the principles Ithink that are important in publiccommunication but I think that both thechallenge of translating nuancedarguments into what's actually coveredthat was tough for many public healthofficials I think the other thinghonestly just on a human level thatbecame hard for many of them and I I'mthinking particularly about local andstate public health officials who are onthe front lines that I talked to a lotwas they ended up getting attacked a lotand abused a lot during the pandemic andI don't just mean like attacked online Imean people showing up at their housespeople harassing their children uhpeople threatening their safety um andand this was often people who were upsetabout some of the requirements that werebeing put down from local Departments ofhealth and you can understand Co was asstressful a time as we've seen recentlypeople lost their jobs people werelosing loved ones I mean talk about astressful time but I think at a humanlevel Public Health officials who wereexposed to that kind of abuse and whostarted to worry about their children'ssafety um many of them stepped out ofthe arena and said is this really worthit to put my family at risk um and thatwas hard because we lost a lot of goodPublic Health people in that respect soI think I think in addition to havingsort of these core principles of publichealth communication in place I thinkwhat we also need to restore is anenvironment where we of frankly ofhumility and civility where where wedon't attack people you know who maybehave different views or are coming outwith recommendations that um you knoware not palatable uh to us and uh and Ithink it's also incumbent upon ourleaders in society to not Stoke thatkind of resentment and violence as wellCU that happened during the pandemic asCo got increasingly politicized and youknow while that may have been at timesdone for political reasons here or therethe people who suffered were both thepublic health leaders who were trying todo the right thing for their communitiesand the public themselves who weren'table to have a clear direct channel uhto and a dialogue with their PublicHealth officials uh because a lot ofthat ended up getting closed off yeah Ifeel like there was a lot of talkingdown to the dissenters in the generalpublic yeah uh and I totally agree thatum you know getting violent or harassingpeople with whom you disagree is istotally inappropriate Andrew the onething just to say about the humility"

at least some sort of acknowledgmentthat there are people who at least feelthat there have been vaccine injuriesright to Simply say um okay the previoustime round with coid went this way andnow there's now virus X right let's hopenot God forbid but sounds like it'scoming at some point and people aregoing to think to the last time andthey're goingto immediately say well the last time wewere told to you know uh take a vaccinesome people had a good experience withthat other people didn't and it in thisempathy model of acknowledging and youknow you know letting your moral compassguide and understanding the why behindwhat people are are are doing and howthey're reacting it seems to me that nowwould be the time to at least try andunderstand where they're coming fromeven if one disagrees maybe evenespecially if one disagrees and try andget people aligned now before the nextpandemic it and um so what efforts arebeing made if any to try and acknowledgeum that some people really do feel as ifthey were harmed I'm not saying if theywere or not but clearly there are peoplewho feel that they were people they knowwere harmed is there an effort topresent them with data to havediscussions with them to try and getpeople aligned so that the next timearound uh we can be more of a unifiedfront whatever the necessary responsehappens to be yeah no it's a reallyimportant question and and to me Ialways go back to sort of firstprinciples from practicing medicineright which is if there is a medicineyou give a patient and even if it helps99.99% of patients but this oneparticular patient happen to be harmedby it you go in you acknowledge it youtalk about it and you together TR out apath for how you want to move forwardand the path forward might be yes let'sget rid of that medication but let's usean alternative let's try it or we can'tuse that medication anymore here are therisks you may sustain but we'll findother ways to protect you right sothat's what we would do in medicineright that's what I've done withpatients over the years I think here toosimilarly when I think when it comes totracking Adverse Events from vaccinesthis is an area where the CDC and theFDA track and collaborate uh andtracking means not just not onlycollecting reports from the public andfrom clinicians when they see uh aneffect that may be related to a vaccinebut it also involves analyzing those tosee were they correlated or were there'sactual causation there right because umyou know if I if today for example uh Ifelt unwell uh and I trace back whathappened yesterday and it turns out heyI ate this burrito that was out in thethe Sun for way too long um the questionis am I feeling sick because the burritoor did the burrito just happen to be youknow a you know something that happenedbut it's independent of how I'm feelingum maybe it turns out somebody wasactually sick uh with a GI bug you knowaround me and that's the reason uh thatI'm feeling the way I am today so theanalysis that needs to be done on casesthat are reported uh is important andit's something that the CDC and the FDAdo together now that analysis I think isessential to communicate clearly to thepublic um and whenever I engage withfolks in the public which we do oftenand people will talk to me about theirexperiences with vaccines I do thinkit's important to acknowledge whatpeople have gone through um like somepeople for example like when I got uhvaccinated for Co for example I I feltlike I had mild flu like symptoms for acouple of days you know it wasn't greatI would have preferred I didn't you knowhave those feelings like you know and uhthen I felt better a couple of dayslater and then I moved on but you know Iacknowledge it didn't feel good you knowto to feel that way there are otherpeople who may have had U experienceswhere they felt that they had moreserious uh you know side effects andthere may be a question was that relatedto the vaccine or not so I think we haveto both hear and acknowledge those Icertainly try to do that I know I thinkit's important to keep doing that acrossall of government but I also think it'simportant for us to to help peopleunderstand the process that we have togo through to understand whether thoseare related or not if you go online andthe cdc's uh site where they collect alot of this information and you justpurely look at reports that are given ofpotential adverse effectsthat you can't sort of take that and sayah those are all related to the vaccinelook at this rate of harm it'sextraordinarily High because we don'tactually do that with any other vaccineor medicine right sure we we start therewe do the analysis and we try tounderstand what's actually related ornot so I think that's that's what we'vegot to do here too one last thing I'llsay is that it's important I think alsofor us to to help put this in context ofother vaccines and medicines andinterventions that we use so for examplejust take Tylenol for example like mostpeople think oh well Tylenol it's safethere's nothing bad happens if you takeTylenol Etc but people who track thedata know that Tylenol by and large is agenerally speaking a safe medication butthere are people who experience adverseeffects from Tylenol liver damage youknow and and other adverse effects uhand you know that data is available butwhat has happened in the case of thatmedication is that the risks andbenefits are both analyzed and then arecommendation is put forward about agenerally safe way to use it and thenthere's data put out about the the sideeffects common or rare right but I thinksometimes we also forget that a lot ofthe medicines that we have come to takeand just see as normal part of our lifejust like any other vaccine like there'ssome rate of rare side effects that willhappen I say that because what I worryabout in the black and white environmentthat we're living in is sometimes peoplewill take an anecdote about a potentialadverse effect and we'll portray that asthe rule right and we'll say well look Iknow somebody who had this side effectso nobody should take this because thisis what's going to happen to you if wedid that nobody would ever take Tylenolno one would ever take Ibuprofen no onewould take NyQuil like no one would takeany of the common medications that wepick up at the drugstore and that wecommonly use so uh that's how I think wehave to approach this with a combinationof of clear communication empathiclistening and and data and cont text umagain that doesn't fit neatly in a in ain a social media post per se but Ithink part of what we're we need to doas a country is rebuild the relationshiphonestly between the medical and publichealth establishment and the public andI think it's starts with this kind ofcommunication uh the other question Ihad about the next pandemic and the one"

telling uswhat to do for several reasons one is umwe are a country of many differentpeople yeah I think we um there aredozens if not hundreds of scientificpapers showing that patients follow theadvice of doctors that look like themand sound like them or to whom theywould aspire to be like yeah we knowthis and yet Public Health officialstypically are unitary one person tellingus do this don't do that this is a goodidea that's a bad idea I I'm but onecitizen but I'm putting up both handsboth feet and all toes and saying thatcommittees small but diverse committeesthat people can relate to and feel as ifum the messages that they're getting arevetted through a common understandingyeah so it's a really good suggestionand and I could agree with you more thatA diversity of voices is reallyimportant to to get a message out outand during Co actually that's one of thethings that our office actually was washelping to build was something calledthe community core right where weactually we recognize so very clearlythis is something I you know I came tosee as a doctor sometimes I was theright person to message to a patientsometimes I wasn't right sometimes itwas the nurse sometimes it was uh themedical student sometimes it was anadministrator or the the social workerwith different background different lifeexperiences so part of this work isknowing when to step up when to stepback right but the community Corp thatwe were building was a really diverse uhyou know group of people um and a lot ofthem had Public Health backgrounds but alot of them were Community leaders whounderstood Health even though theydidn't have formal training um butthey're people who knew theircommunities right and they had the trustof their communities and they understoodwhat was going on they wanted to behelpful so we brought them together tosay okay look here's what the science istelling us here the generalrecommendations um here's what we wouldprovide uh you ask us any questions youhave like if there's something we don'tknow we'll go back and look it up um butyou're the leaders in your communitythey should be hearing from you you knowabout about these messages and then thatthose folks went out and actually weworked closely with them collaboratedwith them uh they would design themessages for their community based onwhat they thought made sense theyweren't taking what we said word forword and we didn't want them to um butto me like that kind of diverse approachis what we need more of now you knowI'll tell you what I would I would haveliked I would have liked if more medianetworks put those folks on TV and gotthem on the radio right because it'simportant that many of them were showingup in their communities were knocking ondoors were uh doing local you knowpodcasts Etc and that was great but Iwould have liked more of their faces Icarried on TV right so that's a placewhere when when we talk to media andwhen I talk to folks in media one of thethings I encourage them and push them todo also is to say look if you can takemore of these diverse faces and voicesand put them out there that's actuallygood for the community and it also helpspeople see that it's not like one or twopeople who are sort of pushing an agendahere this is like the Public HealthCommunity is Big it's broad it's diverseit has a lot of voices and and as themore voices we can hear from as public Ithink the better off we are yeah herehere I I you know again Igenuinely hope and pray that we don'thave another pandemic but if and when wedo I hope there will be committeesrather than individuals I know we youknow this is a thing in this country welike the idea that one person's going tosave the climate one person's going tosave transportation one person you knowthe covers the person of the year typeapproach um but we but then we getfrustrated when that person does thingsor makes decisions that we don't like intheir public or personal life and thenit all seems to fall into Division and Ijust feel like we not talking aboutgroups of hundreds of people but smallgroups so I think we're aligned in thatway yeah and and look there there's Ithink a notion that um I think sometimeswe do want like the one person who cannot only necessarily have all our trustand we can look to but also who we canhold accountable you know if somethinguh doesn't quite work out if we don'tlike something um and and while I getthat sort of mentality I think that inthis moment especially when we're tryingto rebuild trust I think it's importantfor people to know that what they may behearing in terms of medical or SC PublicHealth recommendations it's importantfor them to know how broad an audiencethat's coming from or broad a group ofexperts right and we there was a lotmore broad agreement for example duringcoid and uh during Ebola during zika onPublic Health recommendations but youwouldn't always know it if you turn onthe TV because you were seeing the samecouple of faces so I think we have to tocertainly diversify that um one otherthing I think I'll tell you that'simportant here is I think we have toalso think about how we fund groups onthe ground that are doing the the hardwork of getting Public Health messagesout because one of the things that thosegroups often would tell me and these areI might say the groups I'm I'm talkingabout the community organization thatspent years in a neighborhood getting toknow families where folks recognize themwhen they're walking down the streetthey're like oh yeah that's a personfrom organization X they understand usthey get us they're looking out for us alot of those organizations had spenttheir resources helping the communitygetting to know the community but theydidn't have sophisticated mechanisms toapply for grants for example they didn'thave grant writers who had done this athousand times sohistorically those groups have a hardtime getting support and funding so I'lltell you one interesting thing my mywife did which I certainly was very ofis she was helping to to build an effortand to build a nonprofit organizationwith a couple of colleagues thatorganization of people who knew how toget money how to apply for Grants how toget Foundation support but who also hadthe wisdom to know that the mostimportant they could do was to giveportions of that money to groups on theground so they saw themselves as anorganization that channeled money togroups that had trust and they executedtheir their their mission that way andthat was very effective and I think weneed more of that when it comes todisseminating funding one thing I thinkmany people may not uh may or may notappreciate is that when you it'sactually hard from government to put outa lot of money uh at once and to do soquickly right um like when you've got alot of funds that you need to get intocommunities what happens is the federalgovernment often will give it to Statesstates will then give it to localcommunities uh to like the localDepartment of Public Health partpotentially and then they will look todistribute it to others that takes timebut also means if you're not connectedto that network if you don't know yourlocal Department of Health or you're notconnected to the State Department ofHealth sometimes it can be challengingto figure out how to get the money andso I think we need more operations likeyou know like what my wife and othershave been building to try to get thosefunds directly to the folks who not youdon't necessarily have the most fancyyou know grant writing operation butthey have their relationships because atthe end of the day it's thoserelationships that create the trust it'sa trust that allows in life-savinginformationto get to people and that's the linkthat's missing

            "text": "lot of questionsabout whether or not big Pharma is onthe take for every Public HealthInitiative now as uh somebodywho understands a bit about andcertainly believes in the use of certainprescription medications I find most umquestions about quote unquote big Pharmato overlook fact that there arethousands if not hundreds of thousandsof medications that save lives andenrich people's lives that areprescription drugs um I also believe myaudience knows I say it over and overagain that Better Living ThroughChemistry still requires Better Livingwe still have to get our sunlight getour sleep social connection goodnutrition exercise and all those thingsthere's just no pill that's going toreplace those yeah okay but I think it'sa valid question that people areasking is there a direct relationshipbetween between big Pharma and publichealth initiatives in a way that shouldhave us concerned about the messagingthat we're getting and at times and thefact that the United States consumes thevast majority of drugs for mental healthfor instance as compared to othercountries so that's one question andthen um I want to dovetail into thatquestion what are your thoughts on thefact that you know there's a history ofsay the tobacco industry being you knowuh very uh interdigitated shall we saywith um government policies in ways thathad us basically injure if not killmillions of Americans and theneventually say you can't smoke on near ahospital you can't smoke anywherethere's very few places where you canconsume tobacco products you know thatthat kind of um relationship andfinancial incentives and then a lot ofbackpedaling later um I think wore onpeople's um trust MH so how should weframe the relationshipbetween the pharmaceutical industrygovernment and public health initiativesin a way that is you know at leasthalfway functional it look I Iunderstand where the concern andsuspicion comes from right and look I Ithink it's important that public healthinitiatives and medical advice isindependent of the influence ofindustries that may seek to profit uhfrom what's being recommended or frommedications that are being prescribedand we look we have a history inmedicine right of doctors who were youknow given gifts and vacations and allkinds of fancy things by Pharmacompanies in an effort to influence whatthey prescribed that was reallyproblematic and now we're seeing a lotless of that which is good a lot ofrules are being put in place by medicalsocieties and professional societies andby academic institutions to say this isan unacceptable way to practice andthat's really important because I dothink that human psychology is thatsometimes we underestimate how muchwe're influenced by incentives we thinkah yeah I'm getting that but I know howto make independent decisions but at theend of the day we're human and and weinfluenced or it's a great drug it couldbe wow this is a drug that's reallyhelping my patients I'm happy torecommend it to them yeah so the this soI want to separate one thing though liketaking money from Pharma companies as aphysician I think is highly problematicright I think it's hard to say that itdoesn't influence practice maybe itdoesn't for some people but it's justit's really hard to know who thosepeople are um I do think that separatefrom that you can be a physician whoprescribes medications because youbelieve they work look as a doctor Ihave prescribed many antibiotics duringcases of infection that have helped mypatients and I would prescribe thoseagain I am glad that those exist um inmany cases they've saved the lives youknow of patients I was caring for in thehospital so that's what what shoulddrive us is is does the data show thatthey work and does our patient need themright that's what should drive ourdecisions when it comes to Public Healthrecommendations here too I think asimilar principle holds which is that Idon't think that Pharma money uh shouldbe influencing our Public Healthdecisions which means that it shouldn'tbe funding our public healthorganizations that are makingrecommendations certainly I'll you knowI know this is obvious to you but I'llsay just to be clear for everyone who'slistening like our office uh doesn'ttake any money from industry not justPharma industry from any industry likeour the money that we get is allocatedby Congress at the end of the day it'staxpayer money and that's all we get andand that's important we don't want moneyfrom the you know from pharmaceuticalcompanies um but that's importantbecause people need to know that thesedecisions are not being made for forfinancial gain um with that being said Ithere's a broader concern I have Andrewwhich is I think that we have become apill for every problem Society where welook for a quick fix of a medicine forevery challenge uh that we may incur andsometimes yes I'm I'm a believer that ifscience you know helps us create uhmedications that can help solve diseasewe should use them appropriately but Ithink we discount heavily the behavioralchanges that we need to make the morebroader societal and environmentalchanges that we need to make thatinfluence our health like our foodenvironment matters for our health ourdecisions abouthow Physically Active we are matter forour health whether or not we sleepmatters for our health and all of theseimpact our mental health and well-beingas well and so I I when when I thinkabout the that bias that that to me isnot always you know stemming from moneythat came from a pharmaceutical companyalthough I think it the ads that we seeall the time uh from Pharma companies Ithink try to convince us that hey justtake this pill once a day and all yourproblems will go away but I think it'smore complex than that and and I thinkthat even for you know in the healthcare setting like if you're uh if you'reseeing a patient who has pain uh who'shaving intense pain it feels easiersometimes to prescribe a medication forthat pain rather than trying to to dealwith non-medication based you knowapproaches or try to get the deeperorigins of the pain I'm not sayingthat's what doctors do all the time butI'm saying that we're living in anenvironment and a broader culture wherewe I think increase ly reach forsomething that we see as a quickimmediate fix uh and again don't blamepeople for that we rather take a quickfix over something that's going to takea long time but I think it is selling usI think sometimes a false hope which isthat that's all we need to solve ourproblems and I think a lot of times youneed more you need the behavioralchanges you need the environmentalchanges um that's one of my big concernsin terms of how we communicate abouthealth would a potential solution be"

theperson would feel very well cared for umso again small Committees of people withdiverse expertise pooling together totreat people from a for lack of a betterword a more holistic perspective why notI mean you're describing the dream Ithink that's exactly what we needinterdisciplinary teams that can provideintegrative care recognizing that inthis day and age there's not one personwho has all the expertise to help usfigure out how to best manage our healthchallengesum I think what we have not figured outare a couple of things number one whoare all the right people who need to bein the room uh or the sort of virtualroom if you will the second is how do wecreate a a structure a Health CareSystem where that can actually happenwith efficiency where it can bereimbursed appropriately but that's whatwe should be doing and then the ThirdLeg of that is the the group experiencefor patients right and there'sincreasingly in more clinics and healthcCare Systems around the country that areworking on creating group experienceswhere patients who all let's say areworking on diabet on their diabetes uhcome together let's say once a week andthey meet uh with the healthcarepractitioner that might be an additionto their individual appointments butthere is so much power in groups comingtogether uh groups of patients who canfind Community who can help each otherlearn from each other's experiences uhthat's highly underutilized right now inmedicine um but to really do this wellAndrew I think means that we have to wehave to pull back from the model we havehad for years in medicine which has beena very a highly individual type modelwhich says okay you go to your doctoryou see your doctor oneon-one you geteverything you need maybe you need to gosee a specialist okay then you wait afew weeks get another appointment Drive30 miles go see somebody else maybethey're connected to the electronichealth system maybe they're not maybethey know what was discussed maybe theythey don't maybe they'll call and talkto their primary care doctor but maybethey won't because they're too busy andthen you as a patient are stuck tryingto piece all this together while oftenin pain well yeah in in physical andemotional anguish I'm not referring tomy own experience although I've had youknow mild examples compared to whatother people have dealt with but youknow people with chronic pain areirritable for understandable reasons Imean it it it's or maybe somebody'sclose veering towards suicidaldepression then there's theinterpersonal effects I mean I feel likethe the crisis is is one of a lack ofefficiency and thoroughness and um andagain I'm not throwing stones at themedical profession I I like you believethat it's a collection of mostly umwell-meaning people trying to do theirbest but the specialist model and thereferral model is incredibly cumbersomeit really is cumbersome and and like youlook I having worked with many medicalprofessions over the years like theseare colleagues who I deeply admire Imean like they're there for the rightreasons they want to help peoplealleviate suffering but they too arefeeling burned out and frustrated by theinefficiencies of the system becauseI'll tell you one of the greatestcontributors to burnout for doctors andnurses is a lack of self-efficacy it'sseeing a patient who has a problem infront of you and feeling like you can'tget them the help uh that they need thatis a the greatest paper cut if you willuh to the sort of spirit of cliniciansand many find themselves in thatcircumstance where they either find thatthey know what's needed but the systemis throwing up prior authorizations orother insurance hurdles and prev theirpatient from getting that care or theyare kind of at the edge of theirexpertise right this happens topediatricians and primary care doctorsmore broadly all the time with mentalhealth right most of the mental healthcare that's delivered in this country isdelivered in primary care offices rightnow Primary Care offers didn'tnecessarily train specifically and onlyin mental health yet they findthemselves having to manage a lot ofthat including increasingly complexsubstance use disorders uh and youtreatment resistant depression and theyneed help figuring that out but if youdon't have a lot of resources to getthat referral to collaborate with themental health professionals then you'restuck on your own figuring that out andso you look I think the pain is beingexperienced mostly by patients and butalso very much so by clinicians andthat's why that overhaul is needed and II think look a lot of this is you knowI'm not a healthcare Economist per sebut I will say that a lot of this Ithink is tied into the business modelthat we built around medicine uh thenotion that um you know we're payingindividual people for IND idual servicesand individual procedures that are doneuh while that has some Merit in somecases what we really care about is thatthe person is getting efficientintegrated multi-disciplinary careoverall and so when health systems forexample come together and say okayrather than um sort of focusing on theamount I'm getting reimbursed for everyprocedure we're going to take more of avalue based approach here where we sayokay we've got a certain amount of moneyto care for certain people what's themost efficient way for us to providethem carerecognizing if we don't do that it's notonly bad for them but our costs in thelong term will go up because we're notgetting reimbursed for every procedurewe're getting reimbursed for the thecare overall care that we're taking fora patient so there are more of thesevalue-based models that are are beingadopted uh certainly in 2010 when theAffordable Care Act was passed and whenuh other measures were taken in theObama Administration in Medicare likethat really pushed value based paymentmodels forward um and again they're notperfect they've got they need their owntweaks but I don't think that theexisting Financial structure that we hadin medicine was serving Us in terms ofdelivering the kind ofmulti-disciplinary integrated efficientcare that we increasingly need toughproblem but through recognition of toughproblems comes good Solutions that's mybelief I'm an optimist at the end of theday you mentioned mental health uhlately you've been increasingly vocal"

toacknowledge and address these toughproblems the more entrenched theinterests become that profit from thestatus quo right so if you look at umthe private insurance industry uh rightnow there are so many challenges we haveright now with patients and clinicianssaying that they know what care isneeded but it gets denied they know whatcare is needed but prior authorizationsyou know get grown up there and requireduh even for a medicine that clearly yourpatient needs urgently you know I've hadthe experiencemyself of having a family member who'sneeded a medication for an urgentsituation and then being told that thepharmacy will not fill it because itrequires a prior authorization but thatcan't be processed uh until the weekendis over because no one's in the officeto approve the prior

patientswho have been denied Care by aninsurance company being on the phonesaying I'm sitting here in front of mypatient I know that they are sick I knowthey can't go home I know they need tobe in rehab there's nobody literally tohelp them at home but then not havinglike the the rehab bed approved bysomebody who's not even there right andthere's also just a a practice thatwe've seen time and time again whereinsurance companies will also justburden clinicians with more and morerequests for information before theywill agree to reimburse for servicesthat have already been delivered for apatient who needs them which is justcreating more and more barriers hopingthat if you're a small time doc outthere who's got you know your shinglethat you put up you don't have a lot ofresources how are you going to keepfighting all of this and sending moreand more paperwork and So eventuallyyou'll just give up um we have a lot ofproblems right there in an industry thatshould be deliveringcare often is doing good things but toooften I think is allowing barriers to beput up uh to the care that's needed andthis is particularly true with mentalhealth I know we're going to talk aboutthat but Mental Health Care is just beensuch a difficult thing for people to getin our country and part of the reasonthere are many reasons but one of themis that insurance companies historicallydid not reimburse adequately or in thesame level for mental health care asthey did for physical healthare or ifthey did they would only reimbursed fora limited number of sessions that youcould have uh but how if if you're a momout there who sees her child strugglinguh with depression you're really worriedum you don't want to be told you knowwhat uh you can only get three sessionsthat's it what are you supposed to doafter three sessions right uh and sowhat has happened is that even though in2008 there was a law p called theaddiction uh equity and mental healthparity law even though that was passedto try to close that Gap there were manyways that insurance companies wereskirting it right so one the law wasn'teven being adequately were enforced formany years but two insurance companiessometimes would say okay you know we'rereimbursing adequately but when you lookin the network they had very fewprovider so you really couldn't accesssomebody right so that was a problem forpatients and then the other challenge isthat they would say okay you can seesomebody but you've got to complete thisprior authorization have that completedby your primary care doctor Etc againthrowing up more and more barriers sovery recently in fact just a few weeksago um President Biden just announcedthat we are from as an Administrationputting out a proposed rule to actuallystrengthen uh the mental health parodylaw to prevent some of these what Ithink of as abusive practices becausethey're preventing people who need carefrom getting it and if you've ever beenas I know many people have been who arelistening to this if you've ever been ina situation where you or somebody youlove has struggled with a mental healthconcern what you need in that circumcumstance is help you don't need to befilling out paperwork you don't need tobe waiting 3 months to actually get careyou don't need to show up and be toldonly you only have two more appointmentsyou need to know that help is there whenyou need it and a lot of these uhdenials are are being issued to peoplewho have done their their part of thebargain they' paid their premiumsthey've held up their end of the bargainand Care should be there for them whenthey need it so anyway this is somethingthat upsets me a lot because I just Ihave seen too many patients over theyears struggle without the care thatthey deserve and should get because thebarriers that are being thrown up uh byindustry but I say all that just to saythat when you take on big problems youwill run up against entrenched interestsand that's a fight we have to take on wecan't shy away from it we can't say youknow this is politically too difficultlike one of the things I'm very proud ofis that we're finally negotiating ondrug prices through the Medicare programsomething that should have been donedecades ago but it's finally happeningnow um you know the administration justdecided this has got to happen it waspassed by Congress this is good uhand it just it makes no sense that wewould pay more than we need to and passthe cost on to taxpayers uh when we cannegotiate and we got to get look you gotto if you're collecting taxes asGovernment you should be doing your bestto make sure every one of those dollarsis being spent well right cuz somebodytook money out of their paycheck uhdidn't use it for their family didn'tuse it for their kids and they gave tothe government for good reason becausethat supports First Responders policeofficers a whole bunch of services thatwe need but the responsibil ingovernment is to make sure that money isbeing used well and to pay more formedications than we should makes nosense at all especially for patients andtaxpayers so clearly some steps in theright direction are occurring while onthe topic of mental health um let's talk"

synagogues andmosques are we not seeing as muchparticipation in those those types oforganizations anymore and what othertypes of organizations are are out therethat um you know come to mind when youthink about the isolation crisis yeah sothere there are several factors thathave led to us being as isolated as weare one of them as you mentioned is thedecline in participation in communityorganizations and this isn't a recentphenomenon this has been happening overthe last half century in America we'veseen lower participation in faithorganizations in recreational leagues inservice organizations and othercommunity groups that used to bring ustogether and I think you know we cantalk about the reasons why that has beenthe case U but one of the keyconsequences of that is thatpeople don't have places where they cancome together and get to know oneanother especially across differences sowe actually associate more and more withpeople who are like us but this has alsobeen fueled by a few other factors uhthat are going on at the same time oneis that just from a cultural perspectiveas modernity has arrived not just in theUS but in other other countries we'veseen that people are more mobile rightthey move around more we don't alwaysstay in the community that we grew up inuh we tend to even if we move somewhereelse for a school we may go somewhereelse for a job we may change jobs andmove somewhere else we are leavingbehind communities that we grew up withthat we went to school with that weworked with and I'm not saying that'sall a bad thing right we're having moreopportunities and that's a really goodthing but I think one thing that we havenot accounted for is the cost of thesechanges right if we know what the costsare of certain actions we may still takethose actions but we may find ways tomitigate the the costs we may in thiscase invest more in our relationships bemore conscious about reaching out toother people going to visit at them uhbut that has been a a quiet but butdevastating Consequence the other piecewith modernity is that we have moreconvenience in our life which means thatwe also don't need to see other peopleto get certain things done like buyinggroceries or mailing an item out orgetting something from the store I cansit in the comfort of my home and haveeverything just come to me now on theone hand that's incredibly efficientright but I think efficiency is aninteresting thing because it's only onefactor we should be considering in ourlives there too we have to ask the costand one interesting thing about Co ismany people in the first year of Co whenwe were all separated from one anotheryou know when we finally came backtogether again I had so many people whosaid to me you know what I expected tomiss my parents and my siblings and myfriends not being able to see them whatI didn'texpect was missing the strangers that Isaw at the coffee shop or the folks whoI ran into the grocery store or seeingneighbors as I walked down the streetlike I actually missed that more than Ithought I would so we have lost out onsome of those interactions and thoseloose ties but the final thing to keepin mind also is about what is happeningwith how we are using social mediatechnology which I think isfundamentally transformed how weinteract with one another and how we seeourselves and each other and this isparticularly true for young people uhwho are growing up as digital nativesbut what has happened there I worry isthat and and it's not that social mediais all bad just to be clear you knowtechnology look I'm I'm a believer thatin technology broadly speaking you knowI'm a user of technology I spent sevenyears building a tech company I'm aBeliever in Tech but I think whethertechnology helps or hurts us is abouthow it's designed and ultimately abouthow it ends up being used and what we'veseen with social media as well is thatuh for many people it ended up leadingto in-person connections being replacedwith online connections um we came tosomehow value andum almost seek out more and morefollowers and friends on social mediafeeling like somehow that made us moreconnected but the nature of dialoguealso changed like as human beings weevolved over thousands of years to notjust understand the words someone issaying but to hear the tone of theirvoice to see their facial expressionlike you and I are sitting across andand we're both processing like our bodylanguage right and I'm seeing you nodyour head and I'm seeing your eyesfocused like all of that matters to howwe communicate um but also like you andI are less likely to say somethinghurtful right now to one another becausewe can see each other if I saidsomething to hurtful to you like i'probably see the the pain orconsternation on your face and thatmight give me pause right when you'recommunicating online with other peoplewithout any of that information or withany of the uh sort of barriers if youwill that make you pause before you hurtsomeone it leads to a very differentkind of communication uh one that can bequite hurtful at times and I also thinkthat one thing people many people don'trecognize is that to communicate withsomebody else and reach out and build arelationship with someone it actuallytakes a certain amount of self-esteem todo that you have to believe the otherperson's going to want to hang out withyou they're going to see somethingvaluable in you and for many youngpeople what has happened uh and I thinkfrankly for many older people too istheir experience on social media hasshredded their self-esteem as theyconstantly comparing themselves to otherpeople like when you and I were growingup uh you know in the ' 80s we wecompared ourselves to other people tooright people have from Millennia butwhat's fundamentally different now isthat in a given day you can compareyourself to thousands of images that yousee online that's actually literallywhat people young people tell me I doroundtables with college students andhigh school students all the time aroundthe country and the three things theytell me most consistently about theirexperience of social media is it makesthem feel worse about themselves worseabout their friendships but they can'tget off it because the platforms aredesigned to maximize the amount of timethey spend on them so you put all ofthis together and I think what hashappened is that we're talking more butwe understand each other less we have alot ofinformation but we're lacking in thewisdom that comes from HumanRelationships uh and I think that that'sreally hurt us you know we see itcertainly in the data that tells usabout mental and physical healthoutcomes but there's also the humansuffering component Andrew like it'sreally heartbreaking for me to travelaround the country to hear hear frompeople of all ages often in quietwhispers about their struggles withisolation about how they feel like theyjust don't matter at all about how theyfeel like they just don't have a placewhere they belong and it's these arepeople on the outside look perfectlyfine right they're posting happy thingsonline to Folks at work they're seeminglike everything's going great this iswhy I always tell people like youloneliness is a great masquerader it canlook like withdrawal and sadness it canlook like anger and irritabilityit can look like aloofness as well andso it's only when we stop to ask someonehow they're doing when we take pause fora moment to maybe reflect on what'shappening in their life that we realizethat wow the majority of people in ourcountry are actually struggling withloneliness yeah I'm a firm believer that"

Rebellion movementagainst um these kinds of Technologies Imean there's a long history of of youngpeople rebelling against the the stuffthat's been put in front of them andthey're like nope no more we're going toRebel in fact that was the way thatyouth overcame the um the nicotine eepidemic if you recall it was theadvertising pitching them against orpitting them excuse me against umwealthy cackling older men in chair inrooms counting their money that was whatactually was successful in getting kidsto not smoke because kids have arebellious streak as opposed to whenthey were told hey smoking is terriblefor you your lungs are going to fillwith cancer kids didn't stop smokingteens stop smoking it was you knowRebellion has been um baked into ournervous system uh in the Adolescent andteen years so do you see a rebellionagainst this um social isolation ourkids going to start putting away theirphones and hanging out together againand that's going to rescue us and that'sa way of saying what can we do for themwhat can they do for themselves and whatcan we do as adults because there are alot of um the silent suffering is thething I also really worry about yeah soit's a good question and I think thereis already uh a movement that's buildingamong young peopleto create distance between themthemselves and their devices andparticularly social media and it it'sit's cropping up in different ways I'mmeeting more and more some of these areorganized efforts but I'm also meetingmore uh families uh where the parentsand kids together have decided thatthey're going to delay using socialmedia and you know till past middleschool or in some cases even later orwhere they're deciding that they'regoing to draw boundaries around socialmedia use or they're going to replacetheir smartphone with a dumb phone thatallows them to do things like text andmake phone calls and use maps and andall that stuff but doesn't necessarilyhave social media apps on it now this isstill a small minority and and we'redealing with a bit of a network effecthere right because if you're the onlyone who's not on social media uh in yourmiddle school class then you might feelleft out which is why it's so importantfor parents to and and kids actually dothis together but I do think that to useyour analogy with smokingthat one thing that I I think many youngpeople bristle against is this notion ofbeing manipulated and used for theprofit you know of a social mediaplatform and the reality is that theagain we've talked about how thefundamental business model is for mostsocial media platforms is built on howmuch time you spend on those platformsthat translates to ad revenue and thattranslates to the bottom line whereaswhat I care about as a parent as searchin general is about how well that timeis being spent is it actuallycontributing to the health andwell-being of a young person or or is itnot is it actually harming them and thisis where I think when I go out and talkto young people about this number oneI'm so impressed by a lot of youngpeople because they they already have alot of these insights they're the onesliving it right they're not thinkingthat this is all you know perfect andand it's all a pure benefit here they'rethe ones telling me that it makes themfeel worse about themselves and andtheir friendships but they also having ahard time getting off of it uh becauseagain of how these platforms aredesigned so about a third of adolescenceare saying that they're staying up tillmidnight or later on week nights usingtheir devices and a lot of that issocial media use and this takes awayfrom sleep which we know and you knowbetter than anyone is so critical to themental health and well-being of all ofus but of young people in particular whoare at a critical phase uh you know ofdevelopment um the other thing that isvery concerning to me is nearly half ofadolescents say that using social mediahas made them feel worse about theirbody image as they're constantlycomparing themselves to others onlineand we used to think that this is justgirls who are experiencing this and yesit is uh a lot of young girls who areexperiencing these body image issues butnow it's increasingly uh boys as well sothis is happening across the board butthe other piece I think that concerns methinking about mental health symptoms isthat you look at how much time uh kidsare using social media on averageadolescent are using it for three and ahalf hours a day on average so justsocial media just social media and thatmeans many you're using it for far morethan that and what you're finding thoughis that for adolescence who use it 3hours or more in a given day their riskof anxiety or depression symptoms doubleright so and if they average uses threeand a half days that means that millionsof kids all across our country themajority of our kids are are at riskhere and so you know you put all thistogether and and it paints a veryconcerning picture whatever benefitsthere may be for some kids of usingsocial media and there's some and we layout some of this in our advisory onsocial media some kids find social mediais a great way to express themselves toreach other people to find supportespecially if they're from a communitythat doesn't have a lot of folks wholike them around uh it can be reallyreassuring to connect with others but wecan't say that just you know that to getthose benefits we have to subject ourchildren to all of these other harmsright like kids are experiencingexposure to harmful content toharassment and bullying online six outof 10 uh adolescent girls are sayingthey've been approached by strangers onsocial media and ways that made themfeel very uncomfortable um our kids arealso finding that Health promotingactivities in their lives are beingcannibalized by their use of socialmedia that it's detracting from time forSleep inperson interaction physicalactivity and the erosion of self-esteemreally concerns me as well because youknow you need that not just for socialinteraction but like look as a as afather I want my children to grow upbeing confident about who they are beingconfident enough to be authentic as theyup in the world to not feel like theyneed to create some brand that'sdifferent from who they fundamentallyare just to sell that to the world Iwant them to know who they are and to becomfortable being who they are and toencourage other people to do the same tosupport them in their efforts to beauthentic that's what I want my kids todo that's not what's happening to a lotof kids on social media so I think wenot only need more kids to understandthis and to support them in theirefforts to create space and sacredspaces away from social media but weneed to support parents here too cuzAndrew my big concern with parents islook we've taken this technology whichis rapidlyevolving which we didn't grow up with askids and we've told parents you manageit all on your own we put the entireburden on parents and kids to managethis um you know when we were growing upyou remember the motor vehiclefatalities were really high uh inAmerica and we didn't say okay you knowwhat that's just the price of ModernLife we just have to accept it and keepmoving on with our lives we said hold onwe don't have to go back to horses andBuggies but we also don't need to acceptthis death rate we need to make thisexperience safer and so we put in placewith the advocacy and support ofincredible groups like Matt and othersacross the country that me MothersAgainst Drunk Driving ultimately thegovernment put in place safety standardsthat got us seat belts airbags crashtesting to make sure the frame of carswere robust in the setting of anaccident and that help helped us reducemotor vehicle accidents and deaths andthat's what we need here too like weneed to have the backs of parents andkids and that means from a policyperspective putting in place safetystandards to protect kids from exposureto harmful content from from theexperience of bullying and harassmentand that also protect them from featuresthat would seek to manipulate them intoexcessive use uh which is happening fartoo often right now we also need apolicy that requires data transparencyfrom the company you know researcherstell us all the time that they these areindependent researchers they tell usthey are having a hard time getting fullaccess to the data from the social mediaplatforms about the full impact of theplatforms on the mental health of kidsand as a parent look I I don't when webought car seats for my children whenwhen they were born we looked up thesafety data like many parents we wantedto make sure the car seats were safe butif you had told me that hey you know themanufacturers of these car seats areactually not disclosing some of the thedata on the impact on children uh but goahead and buy it anyway you know I'msure other people are buying these carseats you should be fine I would havebeen very disturbed by that right noparent wants to feel that information isbeing hidden from them about the healthimpact of products on their kids that'swhat we have right now so this is aplace where I think while yes uh and wewe'll we should we'll talk about somesteps parents can take because I want toget to practical steps of people who arehere as parents or people have kids intheir lives cantake but we we we need policy makers tostep up and step into the void here andto fill the Gap because this is too muchagain to just ask parents to manageentirely on their own and this isn'tagain about telling parents what to doand restricting them this is aboutgiving them the support they need sothey have confidence uh when they see uhyou know a technology out there a deviceout there a product out there for kidsthat they know it's been tested thatit's been studied and that it's actuallysafe for their children my understandingis that in uh countries like China there"

on my my stance isglean and learn information online thengo use it in real life come back fromtime to time you know maybe an hour aday maximum or so can I just underscorethe two words you said real life becausethat I think is a really important keyhere which is that all of real lifeisn't happening on social media there'sa whole world out there which I think isreal life which is happening offline andwhat's happening online too often isdistorted right it's giving us like likeeven just takeum you know just take the images thatthat we see of people their uh you knowtheir summer beach images their likegreat vacation images that's notrepresentative of their entire life ofhow they're living their life but we seethat we see people's anger we and theirvital and we come to believe over timethat that's how people feel that's whatpeople are dealing with and experiencingtheir life and and we've just got to getyou your mom I love what your mom didgetting you guys outside um my parentsdid the same thing too like we I wasvery blessed to have two parents whodidn't come you know they didn't have alot of resources growing up they didn'tcome to this country with a lot ofresources but the one of the greatestgifts they G gave us is that they lovedus uncondition Al the other great giftthat they gave us is they pushed us tojust explore to meet people to learnabout the world uh they wanted usoutside playing you know experimentingjust discovering the world you knowriding our bike around the neighborhoodand and that's what we did but right nowtwo critical things that kids need fortheir mental health and development ortwo important forces I should say thatare impacting their mental health anddevelopment one is social media but thesecond also is the lack of unstructuredplate time uh that kids have likeunstructured playtime is time when we askids learn how to negotiate situationswith other kids how to resolve conflicthow to recognize what's going on insomeone else's you know eyes before theysay something we learn how tocollaborate and play with other kidsthis a lot you learn on the playgroundas it turns out but I worry that rightnow that we've almost somehow made thatkind of unstructured time seeminefficient you know we've set thesestandards uh for our kids that they needto be uh you know getting fancy jobs andinto fancy colleges and making an xamount of money and the path to doingthat is you know to be enrolled in Xnumber of activities after school and todo all this stuff in school and theirlives are so hyper structured um that Iworry that the time to just play to becreative to reflect and think to justhave unstructured time with other kidshas evaporated and I think that thatalso is hurting the mental health andwellbeing of our children I love theidea that that unstructured play timecould be framed in the accurate contextof the nervous system developing the wayit was supposed to develop I mean Iwould argue that um success is going tobe easiest for children that engage inthe real world more in fact there'sgreat risk to posting everything thatyou do online we've seen some examplesof that preventing people from gettinginto or staying in college based onthings they said or did previously thatthey shouldn't have said or done umthat's those are kind of you knownegative highlighted cases but ingeneral um we know that the the nervoussystem thrives on diversity of types ofinteractions and social interactions inparticular I'm just restating what youjust said so if ever there was a callfor kids to get out into non-screen lifelet's call it um and engage uh theirnervous system that way it withoutquestion is going to benefit them interms of their ability to learn andretain information perform well inschool which is not everything life'sabout but let's face it we still live ina society where hitting those milestoneson a consistent basis are the best isthe best predictor of people being ableto you know live self-sustained livesbuild families

well I whatwhat can we all do um should we berestricting our screen time to X numberof hours per today I mean you're theSurgeon General if you had a magic wandwhich I realize you don't um and youcould make a uh a highly informedrecommendation about what the thresholdsfor too much uh time on social media areum what would it be two hours threehours yeah it's it's a good question andlet me actually go through some of thesethings that parents can can do for kidsand that we can all do for ourselveswith kids in particular um what I woulddo specifically with social media is andthis is this is frankly what I'mplanning to do with my wife for our kidsas they grow up number one I would seekto delay the use of social media pastMiddle School uh at at minimum and Iknow that that is hard to do at a timewhere all kids are on social media andyou don't want your child to be the onlyone left out and to be lonely as aresult so that means no account of theirown means no account of their own okayand I would make see to the best of yourability see if there are other parentsthat you can partner with to do thisbecause it's hard to do alone as aparent but it's also if there are otherparents you're partnering with thatmeans there other kids who are alsodelaying you so that means your child isnot alone and I think if you start theconversation with other parents you'llrealize a lot of them are worried aboutthe same things you are they may havethought about delaying you but they alsodon't want their kid to be the only oneso this becomes a numbers challenge butpartnership can help us if your child'salready on social media what I'drecommend is to create sacred spaces intheir lives that are technology free andspecifically I would think about thehour before bedtime and throughout thenight as time that you want to protectbecause kids are losing not just sleepbecause they're going to sleep laterbecause they're on their devices butthey're also waking up in the middle ofthe night maybe to use a bathroom maybeto get some water and then they get backon their devices again so the quality oftheir sleep is being significantlyimpacted by access to those devicesduring the night so I would protect thattime hour before bed throughout thenight I would also create make sure mealtimes uh were Tech free zone so thatpeople actually that you talk to oneanother you see one another and timewith friends and family members whenyou're out you know at a birthday partyEtc make that Tech free time let themfocus on their time with other peoplethose three Tech free zones can do aworld of good uh to help your child andthen the last thing I'd recommend herethe many things I think parents could dois to start a dialogue with your childabout their use of social media um wedon't always know how social media ismaking our kids feel uh from the and wemay realize when we talk to them thatthey actually have their own concernsthey might say yeah it's not making mefeel really good but it's just like hardnot to be on it everyone's like textingon this or everyone is uh you knoweveryone's you know sharing informationand posting pictures on it I feel like Ineed to be on it you can only help themstart to manage that if you know thatthat's a challenge that they're havingso opening a conversation so your childknows that you're not judging them butyou're trying to understand theirexperience is important also so you canhelp them understand what is notacceptable for them to experience onsocial media if they're being harassedor bullied by strangers uh that is aproblem you want your child to to tellyou about that to report that um if theysee something posted online that'sreally concerning to them let's say theysee a friend post that they're thinkingof taking their own life or harmingthemsel in another way you want them toknow that that's important to flag andto get help you know that they shouldn'tjust you know scroll past that so thatconversation is really important andfinally as parents we can lead byexample right and this is hard becausethe truth is we've been talking aboutsocial media and youth and that's whatthe subject of my search and General'sadvisory was on but I have concernsabout adults too I said as somebodywho's had challenges in my own use youknow of social media finding sometimesit bleeds you know past my bedtime andI'm realized you know I think m&achecked something for 5 minutes an hourlater I'm still there you know scrollingthrough something uh and sometimes I youknow you know I find myself over theyears I found myself comparing myselfalso to posts I see online and unhealthyways sometimes I find myself um sort ofpulled into uh content uh that uh youknow ends up being angry and vitriolicand leaves me feeling worse you know atthe end so I've experienced this as welland I think as parents one of thehardest things to do is to follow thisadvice we're giving our kids to drawthose boundaries as well and to put ourdevices away when we're around our kidsuh one experience I had which sort of Istill feel bad about but which reallyhelped kind of knock some sense into mewas after my my son was born uh my olderchild I was actually I was search ingeneral at that time you know I had youknow it was lot going on it was busy jobEtc but I wanted to make sure that Iprotected bed times uh and meal timesfor us to be together as a family yetone day when I came home you know afterdinner when we were doing the bathtimeand bedtime routine getting my son readyuh for the night uh my wife was changinging his diaper and instead of helping Iwas just standing at the side scrollingthrough my inbox and my wife who hasinfinite patience and is like one of themost well adjusted people that I knowjust paused and she turned to me andAlice said do you really need to bedoing that rightnow and she said just very quietly but Ifelt this like such a sense of Shamewhen she did that because I was likewhat am I doing like this is my infantchild you know and the rare few hours Ihave with them during the day and I'mjust scrolling through my inbox in myphone like like this is terrible andlook I know that all of us do this itmaybe in different contexts but it was awake up moment for me because I realizedlike one like as you know well as aneuroscientist we can't really multitaskright we're rapidly task switching rightand that was time in my when I head wasin my inbox and my head wasn't with himyou know and my heart wasn't with himright and I was just distracted and soas parents if we can honor those sacredtimes you know when we're with ourchildren to keep our devices away mealtimes sleep time as well it's not easyto do but it really sets a good examplefor our kids um all Behavior change thatwe're talking about here the kind ofbehavior change I've worked with withpatients over the years are physicalactivity and diet all of this is harderto do when we're doing it by ourselfit's a lot easier to do do when we're wehave a couple of friends or familymembers who we agree to do this with wehold each other accountable we encourageand support each other um it's how I'vebeen able to make the most successfulBehavior changes I've made in my lifehave come about because I have two goodbuddies uh Dave and sunny who are my mypart of my brotherhood and the three ofus as brothers talk about health we talkabout our finances we talk about ourfamily and our friendships and ourfailings and we help keep each otheraccountable and so I would justencourage parents like is this soundsdaunting or overwhelming you don't haveto do this alone think about one or twopeople other parents who you might wantto do this with and I guarantee youthere a lot of us are struggling withthe same stuff and they would probablywelcome an opportunity to do this incollaboration with another parent suchspectacular advice that I hope everyonewill follow not just for their kids butfor themselves I think that whether ornot social media is addictive in the inthe true sense of the word is is kind ofmeaningless debate at this point it's atthe very least a compulsive behavior formany of us and as you described it inexample you gave it becomes reflexiveyes we're just you know we're notnecessarily seeking pleasure or lookingto to engage in online battles it's justit's become reflexive sort of likefinding yourself with your hand in therefrigerator just you even think aboutit you're just doing it so becoming moreconscious of the use uh and thereby moreconscious of the value of putting awaythe screens and social media forextended periods of time each day andcertainly in the middle of the nightfolks neuroplasticity brain rewiringhappens in the middle of the night whileyou're asleep and I this when youmentioned kids awake in the middle ofthe night looking at their phone I justI saw you Flinch oh my goodness it painsme and I've looked at my phone in themiddle of the night I try not to but umbut I'm certainly not in the window ofMaximum plasticity either it's terriblefor everybody but especially terriblefor kids um what you just provided is anincredible"

promotehealth I along those lines I I reallywant to thank you um first of all forthe conversation today you're incrediblybusy you're responsible for uh an entirecountry is worth of um people so to taketime to sit down with me and to discussthese topics for our audience is itincredibleappreciated by me and and and by them II feel comfortable extending theirgratitude here and uh it's also clearbased on today's conversation that youface an enormous number of challenges atthe level of budgetary challenges by theway I'm going to work on that um it'shard to shut me up um as well as the thehuge array of of issues that youconfront and um and it's clear that it'sa challenge that you've embraced formany years now under difficultconditions and that you're clearlywilling to get out and talk to peopleand hear their criticism hear theirconcerns hear um and learn from them andso it's been of great benefit to us tohear and learn from you and I hope thiswon't be the the last of ourconversations there's many more topicsto cover but I just really want to thankyou thanks ever so much for the the theintellectual power uh and the emotionalpower that you put into what you do cuzthat is very clear you're a physicianfirst and you care about your patientsand your patients are all of us so thankyou so much Andrew that's for me justincredibly kind of you I thank you Iappreciate that and I've loved ourconversation and you know for me whatwhat I hope most of allfor my kids for our country more broadlyisthat is that we can go deeper likebeneath this these surface issues I Iworry that we findourselves disagreeing about and fightingabout online and recognize that there isa deeper challenge that we are facingthat I think underlies a lot of uhthese the anger and the vitrio and thisissue around how disconnected we becomefrom one another I think is at the heartof that I don't think that there's anypolicy or program we can Implementthat's going to ultimately fix what AlSociety without fundamentally realizingthat a lot of this is amanifestation of a society that hasbecome more disconnected and Moredisinvested in one another like overtime and that's just not who we are it'snot how we evolved over thousands ofyears it's not how we're going to thrivein the future so I know that sometimeswhen you look at these big intractableproblems uh like widespread lonelinessin the United States that it can seemlike hard to address these but I do wantto encourage everyone to to recognizethat when it comes to human connectionthat it is small steps that can make abig difference because we are hardwiredto connect as human beings and if you ifyou just pause for a moment and if youjust think for a moment in your own lifeabout someone who has been there for youduring a time of great need somebody whohas stood up for you and you couldn'tstand up for yourself someone who'shelped to remind you of why you're stilla good person why you still have worthand value to add to the world even whenyou had lost faith inyourself you think about their faith inyou about their support for you abouttheir love for you think about howhealing thatwas that's the power that we have tohelp each otherheal we are going through an identitycrisis in many ways as a country where Ithink we need to ask ourselves who arewe like what defines who we are what arethe set of values that we want to guideus in our life to guide ourcountry and I know that it feels likeWe're a nation of people who are meanwho only care about ourselves who arethrowing blame and anger at each otherall the time who are pessimistic aboutthe future but I actually don't thinkthat's really who we are I think at ourheart we are hopeful and optimisticpeople I think in our true nature we arekind and generous to one anotherum in our hearts we we we'reinterdependent creatures who recognizethat if someone else is suffering wewant to be out there to support them uhand who want to want people to be thereto support us as well that's who who wereally are but we have to to make aClear Choice here about our identity youknow as as individuals and as a countryand recognize that that choice has realimplications for everything else thatwe're talking about here that's thefoundation and when I think about my ownkids growing up like like many parents Iworry about the world uh that thatthey're coming into um I I worry thatthey're going to use the wrong word eventhough their intentions are right andpeople are going to blame them or castthem out you know I worry that they'regoing to stumble and fall down andpeople are just going to keep walking bynot caring you know because everyone'sliving their own life I worried thatthey might become someone who does thesame thing to other people right none ofwhich I want but I want for all of ourkids is for them to grow up in a societywhere we care about one another we haveeach other's backs we recognize as thatold African proverb goes that we can gofast if we go alone but if we reallywant to go far we go together and that'swhat I want for my kids in our countrybut that's what we each have the powerto create in our own lives it startswith the decisions we make but how wetreat one another do we for examplereach out for 5 minutes a day to someonethat we care about do we pick up thephone and call them to say hey I'mthinking about you we can all do thattoday do we give people the benefit ofour full attention recognizing thatwhile time is scarce our attention hasthe ability to stretch time it can makefive minutes feel like half an hour butit's a hard thing for people to getbecause they're distracted by theirdevices but do we give people thebenefit of our full attention and do welook for ways to serve one anotherrecognizing that it's through our actsof service that we actually Forgepowerful con actions but we also remindourselves how much value we have tobring to the world and this is importantin a time when the self-esteem of somany of us and our young people inparticular is being eroded uhparticularly by their use of socialmedia so these are the steps that we cantake to build Connection in our life butthe core values I believe that have tobe at the heart of our identity thesevalues around kindness and generosityaround courage andservice these also have to animate thedecision decisions that we make in ourlife about programs we advocate for thepolicies we support the leaders wechoose they should all be reflections ofthe values that we want to see in ourchildren and in society more broadlybecause I'll tell you that 90% plus ofthe decisions leaders make they makebehind closed doors and what's guidingthem in those moments are their valuesthat's true whether you're the leader ofa company uh or a nonprofit organizationuh or a leader in government so thosevalues matter and I want us as a countryto speak more about the values that wechoose about the identity uh that wewant to Anchor ourselves to um that'sthe way in which I feel like America canbe an even greater Beacon uh of Hope forthe world because the world isstruggling with this too we're not theonly ones who are dealing withloneliness and isolation who are seeinganger uh and resentment and vitri allbubble up uh at extraordinary levelswe're seeing mistrust in institutionssooreU many countries are experiencing this Iwould love America to lead the way insome ways in showing what it's like toembrace a more human identity that'scentered around kindness and service andfriendship uh and generosity like to meall of these values ultimately Andrewstem from love right love is ourgreatest source of power it's ourgreatest source of healing uh I say thatas a Doctor Who's prescribed manymedicines over the years but there fewthings more powerfuluh then love and its ability to help usthrough difficult times and help mendthe wounds seen and unseen uh that weall carry with us and I think if werecognize that we recognize that youknow we don't have to have an MD afterour name uh or have gone to nursingschool to be healers we all have thepower to help each other heal likeAndrew we are not fundamentally a nationof bystanders who just stand by whileother people suffer like We're a nationof of healers and hop makers who canrestore hope that the future can bebetter who can create a better life forourselves and the people around us rightnow it's what we're capable of it's whatwe're built for that's the identity thatI think we now more than ever need toembraceamen and thank you for that um I agreelove is definitely the verb that can getus where we need to go thank you so muchfor your words for your um incredibleefforts to support public health and uhhopefully to continue to support PublicHealth uh I know you've been at this along time um and we've all benefited andum and thanks for your open-mindednessuh especially around some of thequestions that invoke some Challenge andagain for your taking the time to cometalk with us today and uh I really alsoenjoyed it it's it's been a realpleasure and there was a lot of learningfor me and um like I said before uh Ihope it won't be the last time I hopenot either no I look forward to the nexttime to staying in touch and uh justlove this conversation thank you forwhat you've done for being thisbeautiful channel of information for thepublic but it's most more thank you forwho you are you know like who you'reAndrew like comes across veryclearly uh you know when I meet you youjust you have a good heart and you havegood intentions
