            "text": "today I cannot tell you the cure for thecommon cold because indeed there isn'tone one interesting question however iswhy don't we have a cur for the commoncold and the reason is that the coldvirus as it's referred to is actually abunch of different viruses some coldsare caused by one what's called serotypeof the virus other colds are caused by adifferent serotype of the virus thereare over 160 different types of whatpeople call the cold virus now coldviruses fall under an umbrella of ageneral category of viruses called Rhinoviruses you can remember that easilybecause rhino sounds like Rhino horn therhinoceros horn which is of course inthe center of the Rhino's face which iswhere your nose is and the cold almostalways causes some degree of nasalsymptoms in humans it's either runnynose or sneezing or stuffed up nose orsometimes unfortunately all three nowthe reason we don't have a cure for thecommon cold is that all of thosedifferent serotypes of the cold virusmean that the virus itself has adifferent shape on its outside and as aconsequence even if you've been exposedto a cold and you've developedantibodies against that cold virus thenext cold that comes along very likelyhas a different shape and therefore yourbody's antibodies to the cold virus itcombed successfully before can't latchonto and defeat that next differentserotype of the cold virus now a littlelater I'll talk about the immune systemand how those different antibodies aregenerated but for the time beingunderstanding that there are a lot ofdifferent types of cold viruses explainsfirst of all why we don't have a curefor the common cold but also why you canget multiple colds within a given yearor even within a given season becauseeven if you develop antibodies againstone serotype of the cold virus adifferent serotype can come along andyou can get sick again with that newserotype of the cold virus so how do youcatch a cold now one of the problemswith the cold virus being called thecold virus and the fact that indeedthere are more cold viruses present andtransmitted between humans in the coldwinter months of the year is that peoplegenerally assume that it is the coldtemperatures outside that actually giveyou a cold virus and that is simply nottrue however what you heard as a kid ifyour mom most likely but maybe your dadsaid hey don't go outside without asweater or jacket on you're going tocatch a cold or you're going to catchcold you know has ated this uh this myththat the cold temperatures themselvesare the cause of catching a cold virusand that's simply not true the virusthat we call the cold virus is spread bybreathing or by sneezing or by peoplesneezing or coughing or breathing ontotheir hands and then touching surfacesand then other people touching thosesurfaces and then touching most likelytheir eyes in order to self- infect nowwe're going to get into the details ofhow far the virus can spread with asneeze how long it can survive on thehands Etc but for the time being knowthis the cold virus is a pretty stablevirus in that it can survive on surfacesnonhuman or human surfaces meaning skinor on a table or on a glass or on a doorhandle for up to 24 hours so for all youhypochondriacs out there I probably justgave you a little spike in cortisol andfor you non- hypochondriacs I hope whatI just said cues you to the fact thatjust avoiding people who are sneezingand coughing is not sufficient to avoidgetting colds and flu However the factthat a cold virus is Alive and Well on agiven surface let's say on a door handledoes not mean that if you touch thatdoor handle that you will necessarily beinfected with that cold virus and that'sbecause your skin actually provides anexcellent barrier against most virusesand bacteria your skin also includes alot of antiviral substances on it evenif you haven't put any of that you knowalcohol stuff or the hand sanitizerstuff on your skin is a very importantbarrier component of your immune systemwe're going to talk about that a littlebit later but if somebody has a cold andthey happen to perhaps you know wipetheir nose or sneeze into a tissuehopefully into a tissue and then discardthattissue the cold virus particles areextremely small how small well most ofus are familiar with thinking aboutcentimeters or inches if you think abouta millimeter being 1/ 100th of a cmetwell you can take a millimeter and youcan divide that up into a bunch oflittle slices also such that you get theMicron the Micron is 11,000th of a centimeter and if you wantto get a sense of how thick or thin thatis the side of a credit card the littlethin side of a credit card is about 200microns thick so if you set your creditcard flat on a table and then you lookat it from the side that tiny tiny thinlittle Edge that's about 200 microns thecold virus is made up of particles thatare probably in the range of about fivemicrons or so so it's extremely small Imean the cold virus therefore with agood sneeze or even a light sneeze canspread really far now the good news isthose particles are relatively heavythey don't tend to mist about in the airfor very long they tend to fall downonto the ground or onto surfaces but asI mentioned before they can survive fora very long time on those surfaces soshould you touch your hand to a doorhandle or table or shake the hand ofsomebody that has cold virus on theirhands either because they themselveshave a cold or they contacted somebodyelse had cold virus and it somehowlanded on their hands just cu the otherperson sneeze all these scenarios areveryrealistic that cold virus will notinfect you unless it can get inside ofyour body and one of the primary entrypoints of it getting inside your body isvia the Eyes by wiping that cold viruson your eyes now you may think okay I'mjust not going to touch my eyes but alittle bit later we're going to talkabout a study that shows that almostalways indeed almost always when youmeet somebody new you touch your eyesand the frequency of people touchingtheir face that is the region of theface around the eyes and their eyesthroughout the day is extremely high sothis is one of the primary routes bywhich the cold virus is transmitted fromone person to the next but of coursethere's also the route that we're allfamiliar with which is the person thatis sneezing or coughing or blowing theirnose into tissues and then throwing themin the trash and not washing their handsafter each and every time they do thatso an important aspect of today'sdiscussion that we will get into once Ialso present to you what a flu is andhow it differs from the cold is thatwe're going to need to talk about whatstage of infection people are actuallycontagious with the colder flu andthere's actually a lot of Mythologyabout this in fact there's a lot of justlying about this people will be coughingor sneezing and they'll say oh yeah I'mnot contagious any longer or people makeup these things like oh you know if youhad the flu for 2 days then you're nolonger contagious or that you can't becontagious until you have symptoms sowe're going to go through all theaspects of contagion and how coughing orsneezing or how long you've had a coldor flu actually relates to whether ornot you're contagious in a little bitbut for the time being know that thecold virus is very very small it can betransmitted through the air it can betransmitted via contact from skin to-skinin contact and it can survive onsurfaces for up to 24 hours and when youtouch those surfaces or a person withthe cold virus most often the way it'sgoing to get into your body and infectyou such that you get a cold is bytouching your eye region althoughtouching other regions of your body canalso pass the cold virus into you forinstance the mouth and lips but that'sactually far less common so we'll getinto that in just a little bit nowdifferent serotypes that is differenttypes of cold virus tend to create adifferent array of overall symptoms suchthat you know one cold might be a really"

            "text": "is as I mentioned a virus and just likewith the cold there are differentserotypes of the flu virus there arealso different General categories of fluvirus so you've got your a type fluviruses your B type type flu viruses andyour C type flu viruses and by the wayI'm saying flu viruses but of course I'mreferring to influenza but it's justkind of Common Place nowadays to referto influenza as the flu similar to coldviruses the different types of fluviruses exist based on the differenttypes of proteins that they express ontheir surface in fact in the news overthe last few years there have been anumber of different flu virus strainsthat have been described according totheir surface protein character isticsthings like the H1N1 virus what is H1N1H1N1 describes the different types ofproteins that are expressed on thesurface of that particular flu virus nowthe most common type of flu viruses arein that a category of flu this is thetype of flu that caused the Spanish flunow the Spanish Flu which by the way didnot originate in Spain people think itprobably originated in New York orperhaps elsewhere but certainly not inSpain killed anywhere from 17 to 50million people depending on whichliterature you read that's an enormousnumber of people and it occurred in fourdifferent waves of infection thatoccurred between the years 1918 and 1920the Spanish Flu was a type A H1N1 virusand actually it's worth noting that thiswinter season there have been some casesof H1N1 already reported in the UnitedStates and elsewhere now of course thegoal is always to contain thepropagation of those flu viruses andthat is done through a number ofdifferent approaches the best and mostreliable approach of course is to notcome into contact with somebody that iscarrying the H1N1 or any other type offlu virus however based on the way thatthe flu virus infects the body the waythat the symptoms emerge and the waysthat viruses propagate that can't alwaysbe avoided one thing to know and Iconsider this a fortunate aspect of fluvirus biology is that the flu virusunlike the cold virus can only exist onsurfaces for for about 2 hours afterabout 2 hours it tends to die off so theflu virus is most typically passed byhuman human contact or coming intocontact that is walking into a cloud ofsomebody's sneeze that contains fluvirus or somebody's cough that containsflu virus and yes it is possible thatshaking someone's hand could actuallyintroduce flu virus to your hand andthen if you wipe your eyes or I'll talkabout a few other portals of entry forthe flu virus and cold virus in a fewminutes can get into your body andinfect you and yet you can pick up theflu virus from surfaces however that isfar less common than the flu viruspassing from human human contact nowthere aren't as many different types offlu virus as there are types of coldvirus and that's why there have beenattempts at making flu vaccines orso-called flu shots I think most peopleare familiar with the signs andadvertisements online and in theworkplace and school saying you know getyour flu shot this season the reasonthat flu shots can exist at all isbecause there are limited enough typesof flu virus present in a given yearthat specific vaccines that is flu shotscan be generated against that particularstrain of the flu virus so how effectiveis the flu shot and I want to be veryspecific here when we say the flu shotsingular it sort of implies that there'sone flu shot that can combat all thedifferent types of flu and as you justlearned that is not the case so weprobably should be saying the flu shotsbut just for sake of Simplicity when Isay the flu shot I mean the flu shotthat's given in a given flu season thatis directed at specific strains of theflu because researchers have determinedthat that particular strain of flu orstrains of flu are the ones that aremost abundant for that particular fluseason Studies have shown that gettingthe flu shot reduces one's risk ofContracting the particular flu that ismost abundant That season by about 40 to60% but of course the flu shot iscompletely ineffective at combating anyother forms of the flu virus and ofcourse colds or other types of upperrespiratory infections Studies have alsoshown that taking the flu shot canreduce the severity of one's symptoms ifthey in fact get the flu anyway nowpersonally I don't typically get the flushot and the reason for that is that Idon't tend to go into environments whereI am particularly susceptible to gettingthe flu I don't work in a hospital orclinic I don't tend to interact withlarge numbers of people on a daily basisso for me I've opted not to get the flushot now that doesn't mean that I'venever contracted the flu as I mentionedearlier I tend to get sick with a coldor flu about once every 18 to 24 monthsand the severity of that cold or flu hasranged from you know at one point a veryhigh fever in one case but typically amoderate fever and the usual symptoms ofmalaise that we've been discussing andI've managed to get over those withouthaving taken the flu shop pretty easilynow of course we also don't know thatthose were actually flu despite thedistinct differences between thesymptoms of Cold and Flu most peopledon't really know whether or not theyhave a cold or flu so this is anotherthing to think about when consideringwhether or not to get the flu shotultimately because at least to myknowledge most workplaces do not mandatethat people get the flu shot I could bewrong about certain workplaces but myexperience is that most workplaces donot mandate that people get the flu shotwhen you take the flu shot you're reallyhedging a bet you're hedging a betagainst the fact that you will be or notbe exposed to that particular strain offlu virus that's most abundant Thatseason or strains of flu virus that aremost abundant That season and that theflu shot that you're taking is directedat those particular strains so again inmy case I don't tend to take the flushot but of course you need to make thedecision that's right for you forinstance if you have family members thatare immune compromised or you work in aschool or you think that you are exposedto a lot of flu or you're concernedabout transmitting flu to any oneindividual or group of individuals thoseare all things that need to be takeninto consideration and of course speakto your

only is it not specificto a particular serotype of the cold ora different type of flu virus but it'snot even discriminating between cold orflu virus this thing we call the innateimmune system is a

organs and there's anemergency and the Adaptive immune systemgoes in and in a very targeted wayfigures out what sorts of proteins itneeds to produce that is antibodies tocombat that specific serotype of virusokay so the immune system has a physicalbarrier component and it's not just skinsome other things as well you've gotyour innate immune system which is thisgeneralized response system and thenthere's the Adaptive immune system let'stalk about the physical barriercomponent first and this is actually agood opportunity for us to just take abrief step back and realize that anytimewe're talking about our physiologythere's going to be a mechanical set offeatures and there's going to be achemical set of features so right nowwe're talking about the immune systemand the mechanical feature or thephysical feature of the immune system isthis barrier between the organs of ourbody and the outside world and the mostobvious of those is the skin you arecontained in this bag of stuff that wecall skin the skin isn't just forputting clothing on and for adorningwith jewelry or tattoos if that's yourthing watches Etc your skin is a livingorgan in and of itself I think we'remost accustomed to think about the heartand the lungs and the liver and theBrain as organs of the body but the skinis an organ of the body as well it has abunch of different layers of cells fromthe outside to the inside actually theskin cells themselves are made in thedeeper layers of the skin and theymigrate out towards the surface of theskin and at the surface of the skin ontop of those cells and made by thosecells are different types of chemicalsthat actually serve as antibacterial andantiviral agents meaning if a cold virusor flu virus or other type of viruslands on the skin it can neutralize andkill that virus so your skin is a veryimportant physical barrier againstviruses such as the cold or flu virusgetting into your body and infectingother cells and tissues now your skin isnot contigous meaning there are holes init so let's think about those holes fora second as we go from head to foot it'spretty obvious that your eyes have thesetwo openings and those are openings inyour skin right as you open your eyelidsbeneath there are your corneas the shinypart of your eyes and a little bitfurther back at the back inner lining ofyour eyeball you have a very thin threecell layer thick piece of tissue that wecall the neural retina and I say thisbecause the neural retina is actually apiece of your brain so you have twopieces of brain that line the back ofyour eyes and that's the light sensingtissue in the back of your eyes now Isay this because what this means is thatit's a very short distance between theopening of your skin that we call youreyelids and your brain now most of thebrain of course is contained in thecranial Vault within what most peoplecall the skull but your brain isn't faraway from those openings that we callyour eyelids so as a consequence on thesurface of your eyes those corneas theshiny part of your eyes on the outsidethere are a bunch of different chemicalfeatures there are tears that are madeby your lacrimal glands but there also alot of antibacterial agents thatactively kill off stuff that couldpotentially infect your body could makeit into your body maybe even into yourbrain if you've ever woken up in themorning and you have some crust on youreyes and you look at that crust thatkind of yellowy stuff sometimes it'syellow I know this is kind of grossthat's actually dead bacteria that youreyes have successfully defeated duringyour night's sleep so when you wipethose away you're taking the casualtiesof a war that you won during yournight's sleep and you're whisking thoseaway now as we descend a little bitfurther down the face they're of coursethe nostril openings and the nostrilopenings tend to be kind of sticky rightthey're moist sticky and warm right youdon't have to put your fingers up themright now you just know they're moiststicky and warm get your fingers out ofyour nose please the mucosal lining ofyour nose is actually a very importantsubstance that is sticky in order totrap viruses such as colds and fluviruses and then chemical componentswithin the mucosa lining can neutralizethem that's the best case scenario thereare of course scenarios in which thecold or flu virus takes residence inyour mucosal lining and can make its wayback into your sinus passages and canthen infect other cells and tissues ofyour body because the virus replicatesand spreads throughout the body and thengoing a a little bit further down Irealize this is obvious you have yourmouth and what's really interesting isthat your mouth also has mucosal liningwhich is sticky and it has chemicalcomponents to neutralize incomingviruses but we know that the type ofmucus and the type of bacteria that livein your nose and mouth that by the wayare very healthy for you and encouragehealthy immune system function that isact as ways to neutralize viruses withinyour nose and mouth are very differentso your nose and your mouth may seemsimilar at the level of okay well it'swarm and sticky in there there's mucusbut they are very very different tissuesin fact if you think about your mouthit's this incredible structure that notonly lets you eat and breathe in and outthrough although I suggest most peoplebe nasal breathers for most of the timeof their day and night if you can ofcourse sometimes you have to mouthbreathe but keep this in mind that youhave this big opening in the front ofyour face and bacteria are getting inthere all day long viruses are gettingin there all day long and in most casesyou are successfully combating thoseviruses and bacteria because the mucosallining of your mouth and your nose forthat matter and the microbiota thoselittle micro organisms that have takenresonance in your nose and mouth arehelping to contribute to fight offbacteria and viruses provided themicrobiota there are diverse and are ofthe type you want which we'll talk alittle bit more about later and thendescending further down the body ofcourse there are other openings IntoYour Skin Barrier namely the urethra ofthe penis or vagina and of course thevaginal Canal so the genitals of coursehave their own mucosal lining and as youcan imagine it is distinct in terms ofits physical makeup and its chemicalmakeup from the mucosal lining of yournasal passages and mouth and then ofcourse we have the rectum and anus whichis the outflow pathway of yourintestines which arepost-design and frankly there need to bemore data in order to really resolvethis but it seems like the primary entrysite for viruses to get into the bodytends to be the eyes or the mouth and wecan get into some of the reasons whythat would be so but if you think backto our conversation about the way thatcolds and flu exist in the world eitheras aerosols or on surfaces of objects oron surfaces of skin well then what I'mabout to tell you next will make it ohso obvious why the eyes and the mouthare the primary sites of for colds andflu and if you keep that in mind there'sa good chance you can avoid a lot ofcolds or flu that you would otherwisecatch okay so before I talk about the"

very oftenin fact you tend to touch your eyes mostoften after you shook somebody else'shand now why am I picking on you well infact I'm not I'm picking on all of youand I'm picking on myself includedbecause there have been several studiesnow primarily from Noam soel Lab at Thewhitesman Institute showing that whenpeople encounter another person and theyshake their hand they either touch theireyes or touch another region of theirface very close to the eyes or that theytouched their hand to their mouth nowthere are a bunch of theories as to whypeople do this there's the idea thatpeople are actually sniffing their ownhandsand in particular sniffing their ownhand more often after they Shake someoneelse's hand as a way to detect whatchemo signals exist on the other personnot necessarily conscious smelling ofthe other person's smell but rather somesort of unconscious mechanism by whichwe take the chemicals of the person wecome into contact with and we bring themto our nose our eyes or in some casesour upper lip and that our olfactorysystem that is the neurons that existjust behind the back of our nose areprocessing that information and gettingall sorts of important information abouthow stressed the other person is theirhormones uh whether or not we recognizethem the fact that they are differentfrom us that's right we are alsosmelling ourselves all day long noom'slab has shown this that people are kindof walking around in their own odorCloud we tend to touch our armpits wetend to touch different aspects of ourbody yes and smell ourselves multipletimes throughout the day this is allbeing done unconsciously I suppose somepeople are doing it consciously and thatthere's a lot of information about ourphysiology and health and when we dothis after shaking somebody's hand thatthere's a lot of information about theother person's physiology and healththat our nervous system our factorysystem and deep parts of our brain thatare involved in primitive type behaviorsbut also some pretty sophisticatedbehaviors are taking into account nowNoom soel was a guest on the hubin Labpodcast I encourage you to check outthat episode if you have time it's afascinating Voyage into the olfactorysystem and not just conscious smellingor sniffing of things so we go oh thatsmells good or that smells bad or thatperson you know is somebody I want tomate with or hang out with or avoid it'salso unconscious processing of so-calledchemo signals chemical signals but thereason I'm bring up these studies now inthe context of colds and flu and how toavoid getting colds and flu is as areminder that we are pretty much wiredto contact our own face with our ownhands at the level of our eyes nose andupper lip and around the eyes veryshortly after we touch somebody else'sskin and if you are mindful of it youcan actually avoid bringing colds or fluto your face now in doing so are you'regoing to shortcircuit a bunch of otherimportant biological processes involvedin understanding what's going on in yourenvironment because you're not bringingin those smells I suppose that'spossible but with respect to avoidingcolds and flu it seems like a prettygood trade-off to me so the point thatI'm trying to make here is that in orderfor you to catch a cold or flu that coldor flu virus the little particles ofcold and flu virus need to make it intoyour body and the primary entry sitesare eyes nose mouth and the primaryactions by which we bring colds and fluviruses to our eyes nose mouth are bytouching other people or by touchingother surfaces that have colder fluvirus just to remind you cold virus canexist up to 24 hours on a given surfaceflu virus tends to die off after about 2hours on a given surface and we'rebringing to our face we are literallybringing the virus to ourselves so alittle bit more conscious awarenessabout that fact means that you canprobably avoid colds and flu to someextent how much well it's unclear it'sunclear because as you recall somepeople have and are passing along coldor flu virus prior to any symptoms andof course it's possible that you canwalk into an aerosol cloud of cold orflu virus even if a person isn't thereand you don't come into contact withthem but some conscious awareness ofthese routes of path passage for thecolder flu virus I do believe can reducethe probability that you will catch acolder flu and of course I'm notencouraging people to never touch touchis an important part of socialconnection and social bonding but if youstart to think about these portals ofentry for the cold and flu virus intoyour body well then you you know perhapsmight think twice before you knowhugging someone kissing them on thecheek during a time in which you'retrying to actively avoid getting thecold or flu now I feel a little bitfunny about sharing this informationbecause again I don't want to encouragewill always be at you know arms distanceyou know uh you know fake fist bumpingyou know keeping a gap between themagain touch is an important component ofsocial connection but since today'stopic is colds and flu and how to avoidgetting colds and flu just like youcan't get eaten by a shark if you don'tgo in the ocean there's a much lowerprobability that you're going to get acolder flu if you're not touching a lotof hands and bringing those hands toyour eyes nose or mouth I suppose oneway around the sort of do I hug do Ishake hands thing is to just beconscious of the fact that when youshake somebody's hand that you're verylikely to touch your eyes or face withinthe next 30 seconds or so and maybe youend up being that person who puts somehand sanitizer on your hands sometimesthat can feel a little awkward to dothat right in front of somebody you knowit's kind of sending a signal like hey Idon't want you to infect me but guesswhat you don't want them to infect youokay let's imagine that a cold or fluvirus makes it into your system it"

are startingat a point here a hypothetical pointwhereby that colder flu virus has madeit into your body your immune system hasan absolutely exquisitely sophisticatedway of knowing you versus other meaningcells within your body that are of youand cells of your body that are fromother organisms or viruses from theoutside world and when viruses such as acold or flu virus are detected in yourbody your body might not even recognizethat it's a cold or flu virus it mightnot even recognize that it's a virus atall it just knows that this thing that'sin me is of other it's not me I've neverseen it before this is not me these arenot my cells these are not the chemicalsthat I'm producing and your immunesystem is amazing in that way and whenit occurs your innate immune systemlaunches a response what is thatresponse well first of all the responseis very rapid right colder flu makes itinto your body and your innate immunesystem immediately or near immediatelylaunches an attack on that Invader orInvaders because as soon as the virusgets into your body it's going to startreplicating as quickly as itcan whathappens white bloodcells that your body produces will go tothe sites where those viruses are andthe by the way those viruses arebasically getting into cells of yourbody and then hijacking the geneticMachinery of those cells in order toreplicate within those cells and thenexit those cells and then go infect morecells that's how these viruses work yourbody's making white blood cells thingslike neutrophils natural killer cellsmacras these are what we call affectorcells that act as a kind of ambulancesystem and go to the sites that thoseviruses exist and the cells that they'veinfected and start trying to physicallybarrier them in and also use specificchemical mechanisms to neutralize andkill those viruses again anytime you'rethink about biology think mechanicalfeatures and chemical features of aresponse now a key component of theinnate immune system is What's calledthe complement system not complementlike oh you look very nice today butcomplement okay the complement systemwhich exists in the plasma within yourblood these are chemicals in yourbloodstream that go and Mark specificcells that have been infected or viruseswith a signal a chemical signal thatessentially looks like an eat me signalto these other cell types of your immunesystem such that those natural killercells go through the body and go lookingfor the cells that have this eat mesignal on them and try and destroy thoseparticular cells the other thing thaturinate immune system does is that thecells that have been infected and thatare undergoing damage remember they havecolder flu virus within them and they'rehijacking the cell or Machinery of thosecells and using it to produce their ownvirus more of the virus and as aconsequence the genetic Machinery ofthose cells is not able to do a bunch ofother things that it normally can do orat least not as well well those cellsthat are really hurting release a helpme signal and then in response to thathelp me signal your immune systemreleases what are called cyto kindesthings like interlukin 1 interlan 6tumor necrosis Factor Alpha just fancynerd names for different types ofmolecules that go to the site ofinfection and try to help or assist toremove that infection and they also Tredto assist the repair of the cells thathave been infected by those viruses nowone of the mechanical or physicalconsequences of these chemical signalslike Incan 1 Incan 6 tnf Alpha againthose are all cyto kindes being drawn toa particular cell or region of cellsthat have been infected is that itcreates some physical swelling of thearea it impacts the vasculature theveins and capillaries that feed thatarea and in response to they put moreblood there so you get some swelling oryou'll get in some cases the release ofhistamines right we think ofanti-histamine drugs well histamines arean aspect of your immune system theymove around in your body in these reallycool cells called masted cells Mas masscells and when the histamines arereleased that area becomes kind of hotand swelling it's what we call edema andthat whole area is marked as really asight just like a crash site on the sideof the road it's like hey we've got eatme signals to get the debris and the badstuff out of here try to get thoseviruses out of here we've got help mesignals to try and help the injuredcells just like you would try and helppeople at a car crash and there's abunch of swelling so there's additionalblood flow sometimes there's some otherphysical features as well now theimportant thing to know is that theinnate immune system is very fast and itis agnostic to the type of infection infact it doesn't even matter if it's abacterial physical fungal or viralinfection but it certainly isn't payingattention to the exact serotype of coldvirus or whether or not it's an H1influenza or another type of influenzaso way to think about the innate immunesystem is that it is a very fast andnon-specific response to a viral orother type of Invader now that's all abunch of biology but if you think aboutit let's imagine a scenario where you goto a party hang out the party you don'tsee anyone coughing or sneezing butmaybe one person there has a cold virusor they have a flu virus and they aren'teven aware of it they're not going tocome down with symptoms for another dayor so you talk to that person you shakehands maybe touch your eyes maybe youdon't but you're exposed to that colderflue virus you go home you go to sleepyou wake up the next morning you feelfine and then sometime in the nextafternoon you know you start to feel alittle tickle in your throat or youstart to feel just a little bit offatigue ormalaise do you have that colder flu wellpossibly okay we don't know for sure butassuming that that cold or flu virus didindeed make it into your system thenyour immune system is starting to createa set of responses that we talked abouta moment ago but it also tends to impactthings at the level of your brain suchthat you kind of feel like you know Idon't feel quite right I feel like alittle bit I don't feel great and thereare a lot of reasons why you would feelthat way and we'll talk about thosereasons a little bit later but does thatmean that you're necessarily coming downwith a colder flu well technically yesyour inate immune system is deployed tofight this foreign viral Invader butwhether or not you actually get afull-blown cold or flu or putdifferently how severe that cold or fluinfection is depends depends on whetheror not your innate immune system canfight off that colder flu at the outsetand indeed there are many cases webelieve where you get exposed to acolder flu it makes it into your bodybut your innate immune system issufficient to beat it to fight it backthis is one of the reasons why it's soimportant that if you're starting tofeel a bit under the weather and youthink you're coming down with a colderflu that you do certain things in orderto make sure that your innate immunesystem is both ready and that it canlaunch a fullscale attack on that colderflu virus we're going to talk about howto do that a little bit later I'm nottrying to withhold it's just it'simportant to understand that justbecause the virus makes it into yourbody doesn't necessarily mean thatyou're going to get a full-blown cold orflu and in fact that inate immune systemsometimes is sufficient to prevent thatcolder flu from replicating enough thatyou get the full-blown set of symptomsand that's kind of an ideal scenario sowe're definitely going to talk todayabout what to do if you start to feel alittle bit of malaise what to do if youjust discover that oh you know thatperson I was hanging out with at theparty the night before they're reallysick with a colder flu because there arethings you can do to increase theprobability that your innate immunesystem can handle the battlesufficiently such that you never have toget to the next component of the immuneresponse which is the Adaptive immuneresponse I'd like to take a quick breakand thank our sponsor insid tracker"

            "text": "system and this is an amazing aspect ofyou okay the stuff we talked about upuntil now the physical barrier theinnate immune system so so cool but theAdaptive immune system is really amindblower the most important thing tounderstand about your adaptive immunesystem is that as the name suggests itsjob is to create antibodies specific tothe very Intruder that made it into youand infected your cells the veryspecific serotype of cold virus the veryspecific type of influenza such that youdefeat that virus but then in an amazingway your adaptive immune system alsomaintains a memory of that battle andkeeps within your body believe it or notwithin a population of stem cells whichare cells that can rise to more cellssuch that if you ever encounter thatsame serotype of cold virus or samestrain of influenza again that yourantibodies can immediately neutralizethat colder flu virus the Adaptiveimmune system has the ability to makeproteins that have a particular shape ontheir surface that matches the shape ofthe thing that your immune system istrying to kill now the Adaptive immunesystem has two basic phases in the firstphase the Adaptive immune system makesthese things calledimmunoglobulins IGS and theimmunoglobulins come in different formsthere's IGG there's IGM there are othertypes of IGS as well for sake of today'sdiscussion know that the initialwave of antibodies that the Adaptiveimmune system makes or of the IGMvariety and the IG antibodies can travelto and latch on to the surface of thecolder flu virus and it matches itpretty well it's not perfect but itmatches it pretty well think about uhfor instance a particular serotype ofcold virus or the H1N1 flu virus havingyou know very particular Contour on itssurface the M approximates that Contoursuch that it's better at fighting thatcolder flu virus than is the innateimmune system but it's not a perfect fithowever the Adaptive immune systemdoesn't stop with the production ofthose igms the Adaptive immune systemtakes that information about how preciseor imprecise that fit is between the IGMantibodies and the surface of thatparticular cold or flu virus and then inan amazing way send signals back to thestem cell populations in the bone marrowand other tissues and then moreantibodies come out of the IGG varietyand the IG proteins are very specific tothe shape of that particular cold virusor flu virus such that the Iggs then canDefine to and neutralize those viralparticles okay so when we talk about theimmune system we're talking about aphysical barrier that if it isbreached a cold or flu virus takesresidence and starts to replicate theinnate immune system launches ageneralized attack on that colder fluvirus and then the Adaptive immunesystem kicks in usually a couple dayslater first with the production ofantibodies that are pretty specific tothe particular virus that happened tomake it into the body and infect cellsbut then there's a second wave ofproduction of antibodies and thoseantibodies are incredibly specific forthat particular cold or flu virus and asI mentioned earlier the Adaptive immunesystem then acquires a memory of thespecific fit between a given antibodythat it made and the viral Invader andthe successful battle that thoseantibodies waged on that Viral Invaderand that memory is maintained such thatif the next week or the next season youencounter the exact same serotype ofcold virus or same type of flu viruswell then you already have antibodiesready to be deployed sometimes theantibodies continue to circulate in yoursystem sometimes you need to generatemore of them and the immune system isthat amazing it can actually send amessage back to that stem cellpopulation in the bone marrow orelsewhere say Hey listen this virus thatwe beat a few weeks or months or yearsback it's back we need more antibodiesand boom your adaptive immune systemchurns those antibodies out and killsthe virus now as a final point about theimmune system I've been talking a lottoday about cells traveling to andkilling viruses and sending signals eatme help me Etc it's important tounderstand that while cells can migratethrough the the body a lot of what we'retalking about here is the movement ofproteins through the vascular throughthe blood system of the body but there'sanother system that's very important forall of this that's collaborating withthe vascular system and that's thelymphatic system we don't have time togo into a whole lecture about thelymphatic system but suffice to say thelymphatic system can pull stuff from theblood such as viruses but also cellsthat have been beaten up or cells thathave been eaten and are contained withinother cells such as macrofagos and itcan do some filtering of those differentcell types and it can produce its ownuseful chemicals that then can bereintroduced to the bloodstream in orderto help combat the infection now thisbecomes very important when later wetalk about how specific formsintensities and durations of exercisecan increase the ability for your innateimmune system to combat infections sothat your adaptive immune system perhapsdoesn't even have to get involved in thebattle because your innate systemhandled it there are data to show theexercise of sufficient intensity andduration but not excessive intensity andduration can recruit the lymphaticsystem and recruit or increase theactivity of the innate immune systemeven in the absence of an infection suchthat if you go to that party and youencounter that person with a colder fluyou can defeat that colder flu virus atthe outset and never have to deal withmaking antibodies to that colder fluvirus at all okay so now you have afairly sophisticated biological"

            "text": "understanding of what colds are what fluare and the way that immune system worksto fight off viruses like colds and fluso with that in mind I think now is theappropriate time to start talking aboutwhat the scientific peer-reviewedresearch says about how to allow yourimmune system to function at its bestsuch that you can combat colds and flumeaning if you are exposed to a cold orflu that is if it breaches that physicalbarrier of your skin and the mucosallining of your nose your mouth or itgets into your eyes that you stand thegreatest chance of defeating that colderflu at the the level of your innateimmune system such that your adaptiveimmune system never even has to respondto it by creating all those specificantibodies now fortunately there are alot of different things we can do toimprove the function of our immunesystem in fact I feel like anytime thewinter months roll around we start tosee the same list of things surfaceonline and in the press and I don't wantto diminish these things they are infact the Bedrock of maintaining andenhancing the function of your innateimmune system so what are those wellsome of these will be pretty obviousthings like getting enoughquality sleep each night we know forinstance that if you're sleep deprivedso especially if you stay up all nightbut certainly even if you only get 50%or 75% of your sleep requirement thatyour innate immune system is going tosuffer it's not going to be as effectiveat combating flu or colds in addition tothat we know that exercise of specifictype and specific duration and specificintensity can serve to bolster theinnate immune system and we'll talkabout the specific exercise protocolsthat can best achieve that we also hearand it's absolutely true that we needadequate nutrition if we are in acaloric deficit for instance if we'retrying to diet through the winter monthswhich many people try to do that canplace our innate immune system in a bitof a compromised state that said thingslike intermittent fasting or even longerduration fast have been implicated andhere I really want to underscoreimplicated in brief improvements in thefunction of the immune system howeverextended fast or not eating enoughcalories to maintain body weight formany many days in a row can actuallycompromise the function of the innateimmune system I'll go into this a bitdeeper in a moment and then of course wehear about stress that we're allsupposed to regulate our levels ofstress not get too stressed and here Ihave to put an asterisk next to thosestatements because yes indeed chronicstress meaning stress that continues dayafter day after day or even shortperiods of stress that impede ourability to sleep at night can indeedreduce the functioning of our innateimmune system however it's also clearthat short bouts of stress provided thatthey don't inhibit our ability to sleepthat night can actually enhance thefunction of the immune system and thisis something that I don't think istalked about enough you know we hear sooften that quote unquote cortisol is badit's a stress hormone listen cortisol isfantastic provided that it is elevatedearly in the day and not late in the dayor evening also cortisol does havethresholds Beyond which if it's too highcan be bad for us but it's also the casethat if cortisol levels are too lowthat's bad for us and it's especiallybad for the functioning of our immunesystem because glucocorticoids of whichcortisol is have an important role inactivating those natural killer cells ofthe innate immune system they are one ofthe primary signals by which those interlucans like interlan 1 and interlan 6are deployed in our body and so veryoften we'll hear stress increasesinflammation and indeed interlukin 1interlan 6 are pro-inflammatory youmight think oh my goodness I don't wantthat I don't want cortisol I don't wantthese Incans elevated but guess what theinflammation response is also animportant component of that innateimmune system that allows us to combatinfections so in trying to keep ourinnate immune system tuned up I realizethat's not a biological statement tunedup but keep our immune systemfunctioning at its best we wantinflammation available as a tool tocombat infection we want cortisolavailable as a way to activate thatinflammation and other aspects of ourimmune system we just don't want so muchcortisol and so much inflammation thatwe can't sleep and that our gutmicrobiome suffers and that brings me tothe other component that's important forthe basic functioning of your immunesystem so that you can be at yourstrongest when you inevitably encounterthose cold and flu viruses why do I sayinevitably look if you exist in theworld that is if you live live on planetEarth you are going to be bombarded withdifferent viruses and bacteria andfunguses and all this stuff throughoutyour days and yes in those winter monthsbecause people are spending more timeindoors and they're touching each otherand surfaces more breathing on eachother more sneezing on each other moreand so on and so forth there is morepropagation of colds and flu so if wetake a step back and we ask how can Ihave my immune system as strong andready as possible to combat cold and fluviruses we get to those Basics it's makesure you're getting enough quality sleepeach night how much is enough howevermuch you need in order to not feelsleepy during the day except maybe therequirement for a short nap of anywherefrom 10 to 30 minutes not everyonerequires that but that's perfectlynormal to have an afternoon dip inenergy that can be restored with a shortnap or non-sleep deep bre we'll providelinks to non-sleep deep breast and othertools in the show note captions that youknow are zero cost tools to allow you torecover your energy some people justsimply take a nap and that sort of thingif you want tools for improving yoursleep and making sure that you'regetting enough quality sleep each nightwe will also provide a link to our zeroccost sleep tool kit that details that inPDF form it just lists out the thingsthat you can do or take if that's yourchoice and so on and so forth and ofcourse we've done

            "text": "advantageous for keeping your innateimmune system at its most robust levelof functioning and I should mention thatyour gut microbiome isn't just aboutyour stomach you know we hear the wordgut and we think stomach but it'sactually the entire length of yourdigestive tract from your mouth out theother end and different microbiota existat different locations along that tractof mucosa and there are a couple thingsthat one can do in order to make surethat the gut microbiome is bestsupported along that entire length thefirst one is that and this was coveredon the episode that we did with mycolleague Justin sonenberg who is aworld expert in the gut microbiome andthat is to consume anywhere from two tofour servings of low sugar fermentedfoods per day so things like sourkrautthings like kimchi things like kefirthings like kombucha it can be a littlebit of work to figure out which of theseyou like and which ones you're willingto consume on a regular basis but it'svery clear that the brine you know thatkind of uh salty solution around thesauerkraut and by the way when I saysauerkraut what we're talking about hereis the type that has to be refrigeratedit contains what are called livecultures as opposed to the sauerkrautthat can exist in the non-refrigeratedportion of the store or pickles thatalso have that Brine and that have to bekept in the refrigerator even beforethey're opened and of course like yogurtwhich have active live cultures thoseare the sorts of things that are goingto best support the diversity ofmicrobiota along the entire length ofthe gut microbiome such that your gutmicrobiome can do its job in supportingyour nervous system but here especiallyin the context of today's discussionyour immune system now the low sugarcomponent of low sugar fermented foodsis important because what we know isthat if you're consuming yogurts with alot of sugar or you're consumingkombucha with high levels of sugar oryou're consuming pickles or sauerkrautthat have a lot of sugar in them you'reprobably going to start to create someother issues related to the sugar whatyou're really looking for are these lowsugar fermented foods and they can be alittle bit tricky to seek out in thestore but they're usually there and onceyou identify the ones that you like youshould really aim to get two to fourservings of those per day you can alsoconsume a Prebiotic or probiotic in theform of capsule form things like ag1athletic greens also contain Prebioticprobiotic but it's very clear thatconsuming two to four servings of lowsugar fermented foods per day is amongthe best ways to promote health of thegut microbiome and that the gutmicrobiome is so so important forkeeping the innate immune systemthriving such that it can combat thecolds or flu that are trying to bombardyour system now there's another toolthat you can use to enhance your gutmicrobiome I have to warn you this onemight make a few of you um cringe alittle bit but this is one that Iactually started doing about four monthsago um it's an interesting one it kindof dates back to some older quoteunquote traditional medicine practicesbut it makes really good logical senseto be fair I'm not aware of anyrandomized control trial exploring theuse of this protocol but it's so simpleand completely cost-free and it standsso strongly on the logic of how the gutand oral microbiome work that frankly Istarted doing it and you know whether ornot it's placebo effect or not I don'tknow but I feel better and it's so easyto do and it stands to potentiallyimprove the fun of your gut microbiomeenough that I figured I would at leastshare it with you and then you candecide so what this protocol essentiallyconsists of is before you go to sleep atnight or in the morning you pouryourself a little bit of water whateverwater you happen to consume just cleanclear water and then you take a sip ofthat water when you wake up in themorning and you swish it around in yourmouth and then you swallow it now forthose of you that are like oh grosslet's think about this is it reallygross to swish a little bit of wateraround in your mouth and then swallowthat water when you first wake up priorto brushing your teeth of course well itmight seem gross to you but throughoutthe night when you're sleepingespecially if you are a nasal breatherwhile you sleep the environment withinyour mouth is such that you're breedinga lot of bacteria you are creating allthose littlemicrobacteria that potentially caninhabit your digestive tract and provideat least some of the substrate for themicrobiota in your digestive tract tothrive and if that seems gross to youkeep in mind that's what having ahealthy gut microbiome really is allabout so the protocol is very simple atzero cost you take a swig of water swishit around and swallow it oddly itdoesn't taste bad um in fact it'll justtaste like swallowing um and in fact ittastes like swallowing a little bit ofwater it's not as if it tastes like umbad breath or something like that it's avery simple protocol that again norandomized control trials but reallystands on the logic of how the oralmicrobiome and the gut microbiomeinteract and because what we're talkingabout here is supporting the function ofyour gut microbiome such that itsupports the function of your inateimmune system such that you can avoidcolds and flu at least to me it seemslike a pretty low bar yes okay so tobolster your inade immune system you"

exercise is sogood for us it enhances the immunesystem and on and on and listen I'm ahuge believer in exercise I personallylike to do three bouts of cardiovascularexercise per week one long one mediumone short and I do three bouts ofresistance training each week all ofthat and specifically what I do isavailable to you as a zeroc crossprotocol in the form of a PDF we have alink to that in the show note captions Ialso have a whole episode aboutfoundational Fitness and so on and so onthe discussion we're going to have nownow is about what general forms ofexercise actually do support the innateimmune system and and this is reallyimportant what forms of exerciseactually deplete your innate immunesystem this isn't talked about enough Ithink there are certain intensities anddurations of exercise that make us morevulnerable to colds and flu so we'regoing to discuss that before we do thatI want to just briefly touch intosomething that I hear a lot which is thequestion if I'm feeling a little bitrundown should I exercise or not and tobe honest there isn't a straightforwardanswer to that question it's impossiblefor me or for you to know whether or notyou were indeed exposed to a cold or fluand you're starting to combat it at thelevel of your Nate immune system orwhether or not you're just you knowfeeling a little bitsluggish however what we do know is thatif you are feeling malaise at the levelof the body like your body is feelingdifferent it's feeling heavier you'refeeling tired you're feeling tired at atime of day that doesn't make sensegiven your usual patterns of being tiredyou're feeling tired in a way thatdoesn't make sense given how much sleepyou got the night before right I meanhere what we're talking about is rulingout any possible you know life stressoryou were up too late or you drankcaffeine at the wrong time or somethinglike that what we know is that you're ifyou're feeling that General malaiseacross your whole body it is fairlylikely that you're coming down withsomething and that your best response tothat would be to go home take a hotshower or bath I'll explain why youwould want to do that in a few minutesand then get into bed early and even ifyou can't fall asleep to just be asstill and as relaxed as possible we knowthat if you push into bouts of intenseactivity or even just push yourself toengage in activity when you're feelingrun down at that sort of whole bodylevel maybe a little tickle in yourthroat you are going to compromise thefunction of your innate immune systemand it's very likely that you're goingto get more sick than you wouldotherwise so here's my suggestion ifyou're starting to feel rundown at thelevel of whole body malaise or you justdon't feel rightyou're best off taking a hot shower bathand getting into bed or just gettinginto bed and trying to rest and get asmuch sleep probably even a little bit ofextra sleep and here's why that wholebody malaise that extra fatigue that'snot easily explained by other factors inyourlife have to do with the fact that whenyour innate immune system is activatedmeaning it's already combating a cold orflu interlukin 1 and interlukin 6 have away of interacting with a particularbrain area called the dorsal rafaynucleus which is choa block full ofneurons that release serotonin andserotonin from the dorsal rafay nucleusacts on specific regions of yourhypothalamus areas like the preopticregion for those of you that want toknow and other areas of the hypothalamusthat generate a state of sleepiness inaddition when we are getting sick oursleep patterns change we feel like weneed to sleep more but we don't feel asrested from that sleep and that has todo with the ways that serotonininteracts with some of the components ofthe brain circuitry involved in sleepthat controls slow wave or deep sleepand this is a whole discussion untoitself I actually covered a lot of themechanistic aspects of this business ofimmune induced sleepiness and Malay isassociated with feeling sick in anepisode about interactions between theneural and immune system that I willalso provide a link to in the show notecaptions but suffice to say if you'refeeling that whole body Mala is andespecially if you also have a little bitof a throat tickle you're just notfeeling right for you you're notaccustomed to feeling that way at thattime of day or night well then Iencourage you to get rest becausechances are you're already combating aninfection however if you are out andabout a lot during the winter months oryou're interacting with a lot of peopleby virtue of work or publictransportation or whatever the gym Etcyou're a school teacher maybe your kidsare coming home with colds and flu andyou're not yet feeling that malaiseyou're not feeling any throat tickleyou're not getting that kind of um kindof burning or tickle within your nasalpassages when you breathe you know we'reall familiar with these things thewatering the eyes that kind of precedesthe getting the full-blown cold or fluwell if you're not experiencing thatstuff and you want to keep your inateimmune system strong and able to combatoff colds and flu then we know thatexercise can be an excellent way toincrease the output of that innateimmune system what I mean by that is theappropriate intensity and duration ofexercise can act as a stressor thatpromotes a bit of inflammation yes therelease of cyto kindes and a bit ofactivation of the innate immune systemincluding the production of more whiteblood cells natural killer cells suchthat you're sort of prompting

            "text": "exercise there's a wonderful review thatwas published in 2019 in the Journal ofSport and Health Science entitled Thecompelling link between physicalactivity and the body's defense systemand there's a lot to this review articlebut I'll just highlight a few of thecritical features that are going todirectly relate to protocols that Ithink all of you are going to beinterested in first of all we know thatexercise that's of 60 Minutes induration or less and that is intense butnot allout effort okay here we're nottalking about percentage of singlerepetition max weight here we're nottalking about 70 to 85% of one's VO2 maxwhat we're talking about is yousubjectively gauging what is a 10 out of10 effort like you could not do any moreyou could not contribute any more effortto that exercise bout and that's truewhether or not we're talking aboutresistance training exercise orcardiovascular exercise like running orrowing or things of that sort what weknow is that if you do that sort ofexercise for about 60 Minutes orLess you promote the exchange ofcomponents between the blood and thelymphatic system that increase thecirculation of those cells and chemicalswithin the innate immune system suchthat not just during exercise but formany many hours afterwards maybe even asmuch as 24 hours afterwards your innateimmune system level of Baseline activityis ramped up allowing you to bettercombat infections such as colds and fluokay so this is an incentive for gettinga regular exercise of 60 Minutes or Lessperday making it of sufficient intensityfor your anate immune system to deploymore of those chemicals and for yourlymphatic and blood circulation toincrease their exchange of materialsenough that your Nate immune system isbolstered however it is absolutely notthe case that more is better in factit's probably the case that less isbetter here's what we know for sure andthis review covers sort of the extremeof these examples but for instancepeople that do bouts of walking each dayfor about 60 Minutes brisk walkingexperienceincreased te- cell function so that's animmune cell that goes out and combatscold and flu viruses and natural killercell activity so those increase increasemacras function you are now familiarwith these cells if you don't knowexactly what they do just keep in mindthat you heard about these in thecontext of what the innate immune systemdoes to go out and fight colds andflu cyto coses increase but notdramatically okay so this is a mildinflammation response stress hormonessuch as cortisol epinephrine norepnephrine also called adrenaline andnoradrenaline those are deployed as wellso 60 minutes or less of this moderateto high-intensity exercise creates thismild stress response and an increase inthe function of the inate immune systemhowever people that run a marathon andas I recall a marathon is 26.2 miles ifI'm notmistaken they experience a verydifferent pattern of immune response tothat long bout of exercise so here we'recomparing one hour of exercise to 3hours is that what it takes to run amarathon I have some friends that aremarathoners I'm guessing about threemaybe four hours if you're really slowbut somewhere between you know I don'tknow two and a half and three hours ifyou're trained up and you're doing itand you're doing them regularly wellhere's the point people who just ran amarathon and people who have beentraining for a marathon and areapproaching that Marathon are severelyimmune compromised the levels of theirte- cell function are way below Baselinemeaning their inate immune system is notfunctioning nearly as well as it wouldif they were to not exercise at alltheir natural killer cell activity isalso greatly diminished these are hugehuge reductions in these cells that isin the function of the inate immunesystem and their stress hormones andtheir inflammatory molecules such ascyto circulating in their blood areextremely high now again we'rerepresenting opposite ends of thespectrum here with 1 hour or less ofexercise daily versus 26.2 mile marathonexercise or half marathons as the casemay be and let me be very direct I'm notdiscouraging people from running ortraining for marathons or half marathonsI think that's great just understandwhat you're doing to your immune systemwhen you do that and take the necessaryprecautions but I think most peoplelistening to this are trying to thinkabout ways that they can avoid gettingcolds and flu and certainly runningmarathons is not going to be the way todo that quite the contrary the way to dothat is in addition to the other thingswe've been talking about to get regularexercise maybe not every single day I'mactually aan of taking one day per weekcompletely off from exercise usually onthat day I'll do some sauna and cold ifI have it available to me but the pointis this you don't have to exercise foran hour a day in order to get thisImprovement in the inate immune responsedata show that you can get thisImprovement in anate immune responsewith as little as 20 minutes per day andprobably even as little as 12 minutesper day however if you're going to tryand accomplish this increase in theinnate immune system function or outputwith a shorter bout of exercise such as12 minutes it better be 12 minutes ofvery high-intensity training in factthat's what lands on my uh for me it'sFriday but it doesn't really matterwhich day of the week there is one dayof the week where I do a very short boutof cardiovascular exercise but I'msprinting hard for anywhere from 20seconds to a minute and then I'm takinga brief period of rest and thenrepeating that for a total of 12 minutesnow some people here oh only 12 minutesof exercise required and they default to12 minutes every single time they trainI don't think that's a good idea I thinkwe can take the law of averages here andsay the following I do believe everyoneshould do a combination ofcardiovascular training and resistancetraining perhaps I think in general noton the same days but if you're going todo that and you want to maintain healthyimmune system function my suggestionwhat I do is unless it's the long boutof cardiovascular training that I doonce a week and long for me means 60 to90 minutes and sometimes longer if it'sa hike which certainly doesn't requirethat much intensityI suggest warming up for about 5 to 10minutes and then limiting your totalworkout duration to about 50 minutesmaybe 60 minutes if that's what'srequired to complete what you need to doin order to keep with your exercisegoals but to be very careful aboutexceeding 75 minutes of exercise in anyone single exercise bout and if youremember back to the beginning of the"

them ifthey've initially made their way intoour system but we haven't developedfull-blown symptoms and we want toprevent those full-blown symptoms is theuse of deliberate heat exposure inparticular sauna there's a nice study onthis that was published very recently2023 the title of the study is theeffects of a single and series offinished sauna sessions on the immunesystem response and heat shock protein70 levels in trained and untrained menit's a very interesting study theycompared athletically trained andnon-athletic trained men as most of youprobably know when you get into a hotsauna heart rate increases there's vasoddilation there's the increase in therelease of heat shock proteins there'sthe increase in things like dorphinwhich if it's sufficiently hot areincreased to levels that make us feelkind kind of agitated and not so good wehave to actively calm ourselves in thesauna so we're not talking about an easycruise at 150\u00b0 fenhe we're talking aboutgetting up into the you know 180 degreeFahrenheit or 210 degree Fahrenheitrange maybe even higher if you're heatadapted and that the dorphin makes youfeel lousy in the short term but that itupregulates a bunch of differentbiological mechanisms that give you kindof low-level Euphoria and actually thecapacity to experience more feelings ofwell-being from the endorphins that youmake after you get out of the sauna thisis oh so important to understand whetheror not we're talking about exercise ordeliberate cold exposure or deliberateheat exposure what happens during theheat exposure cold exposure exercise ismore often than not just the trigger forthe long-term adaptation that we'reseeking just like exercise increasesyour heart rate and blood pressure butthen leads to reductions in restingheart rate and blood pressure and so onand so forth this study is interestingand there are a lot of differenttakeaways from this study because theycompare these two differentpopulations I'll just give you the topContour of what the protocol entailedthere were 10 sauna sessions each ofthose sauna sessions were three roundsof 15 minutes of sauna so one sessionmeant going into the sauna the sauna wasof a given temperature but I think formost people what's going to work interms of what parallels the study isgoing to be somewhere between 176 and210 degrees Fahrenheit depending on howheat adapted you are always be safedon't do this if you're pregnant don'tthis if you're a child Etc so they'redoing three rounds of 15 minutes eachseparated by 2 minutes during that 2minutes they take a cool shower wherethey cool off in some way they're notgoing into a cold plunge but they'recooling off with a coolshower and they're doing that threetimes that's onesession they do 10 sessions those saunasessions were spaced apart by at least afew days and the entire experimentmeaning all 10 sessions were completedwithin a 3-we period and then a bunch ofthings were measured like the amount ofwhite blood cells and immune cells thatwere deployed after the first sessionversus the third versus the eth versusthe 10th and so on as well as the levelsof cortisol and inflammatory markersthere are a lot of different thingsmeasured in this study here's what weknow sauna baths as they're calling themresulted in a statistically significantincrease in cortisol concentration afterthe first and the 10th sauna sessionokay so every time you go into the saunayou're getting an increase in cortisolwe know that because the heat is astressor again don't think about heat asoh you're just kind of relaxing in theonet so nice you're getting a cortisolresponse cortisol is a glucocorticoidstress hormone as it's sometimes calledwhich can be a good thing if it sets inmotion a number of other things such asthe increase in the activity of theanate immune system and indeed that iswhat they observed after and here I'mparaphrasing after the first and 10thSaab baths they witnessed an increase inlucite count lucaites are a particulartype of cell of the inate immune systemhowever only after the last saunasession did this change reachstatistical significance in the trainedgroup so what they observed was thatathletes who are trained are used tobeing in high heat conditions because oftheir athletic training people who arenot trained in athletics are not used tothat there are a lot of different waysto look at these data but the simplesttakeaway is that if you are already veryheat adapted because you do saunaregularly or you exercise regularly wellthen it's going to take a strongerstimulus or more sauna either longer orhotter or more frequent to get the sortsof increases in innate immune responseas compared to someone who's never donesauna who's not exercising regularly andthat just makes sense if something isn'tstressful to you you're not going to getthe stimulation of that innate immuneresponse and the overall takeaway fromthis study was that I do believe that ifyou're feeling run down a little bit bitor if you're just trying to keep coldsand flu at Bay having some regular ispractice of getting into the sauna forthree rounds of 15 minutes separated bytwo-minute cool off you don'tnecessarily have to do a cold shower ora cold Plunge in between although Idon't see why you couldn't or wouldn'tyou could also just get out of the saunaand be in the cool air and then get backin or perhaps you do something more akinto what's been shown in other studiesthat explore the relationship betweenheat exposure and immune response whichis to do two rounds of 20 minutes or oneround of 30 minutes in the saunawhatever you can do safely andcomfortably keep in mind safety is KeyDon't harm yourself I say that not toprotect me but to protectyou that sauna is an effective way ofincreasing the activity of the inateimmune system it increases Lucy levelsyes it increases cortisol levels but ina way that promote the activity of theinate immune system however and here weare back to exactly the same thing wesaid about exercise if you're alreadyfeeling really rund down feeling kind ofheaviness in the body you don't feelwell you're starting to get somesniffles don't get in a very hot saunabut for sake of keeping colds and flu atBay sure do three rounds of 15 minutesin the sauna between 176 degrees 210degrees whatever you can safely toleratetake those two-minute breaks in betweenmaybe do a cold shower or coolish showermaybe just stand outside the sauna inbetween if you're feeling really strongdo a coal plunge for a minut two minutesin between you don't have to but youcertainly could and then get back in andthen repeat or just do one 20 minutesession or 30 minute session all ofwhich have been shown to promote theactivity of the Nate immune systemhowever and I realize I said this beforebut I feel like I need to say it againespecially For You hardcore exercisersor people that really feel like oh I canpush through if you're already sick andyou have the symptoms of a colder fluyou want to limit the amount of stressto your body you want to get into bedand sleep if you can't sleep you want torelax you do not want to exercise youshould not exercise not only do youstand to get other people ill by goingplaces where you exercise but even ifyou exercise at home or in totalisolation you're going to prolong theduration of that illness because thereare many many reasons why being stillslowing your circulation and allowingyour innate and then in that case youradaptive immune system to kick in andcombat those infections is going to getyou back into a regular exercise andwork regimen much much faster than wouldbe the case if you were to push throughokay so now we get to the portion of the"

            "text": "discussion that I think probably manypeople are anticipating which is whatcan you take to reduce the probabilityof getting a colder flu or shorten theduration of a colder flu and I actuallyput out a call on social media I askedthe question on Instagram and on Xformerly called Twitter you know what doyou do for a colder flu and what are youcurious about in terms of what one cantake for cold or flu and I got thousandsupon thousands of answershowever many of those answers convergedon some common things things like takinggarlic I heard for instance that somepeople are chewing a raw clove of garlicevery day during the winter um I heardabout people who take fermented garlicsome people swear by eonia some peopleswear by eonia vitamin C and Zinc nowthere are far too many compounds thatexist in the wellness and indeed in themedical literature to cover all of themso I'm going to highlight a few that Ithink are especially interesting andthat have been shown in p reviewedscience to be potentially useful some ofthese you've heard of before and some ofthem I think are going to be surprisingor at least new to you first let'sconsider what most people believe to bea very effective way to hasten colds orflu that is to make them last shorterduration of time than they wouldotherwise maybe even prevent colds orflu the big one there is vitamin C wehear all the time vitamin C antioxidantI grew up in an area where the Noelprize winning chemist lonus Pauling whowas a fanatic about vitamin C he tookmany many grams of vitamin C each dayused to tout the benefits of vitaminC here's the deal there is some evidenceand it's not great frankly that pointsto the fact that taking 6 to8 gramsgrams so that's 6,000 to 8,000milligrams of Vitamin C per day that isa lot of vitaminC each day canperhaps delay the onset of a cold orshorten the duration of a cold so herewe're talking about very high doses andnot a very robust effect I shouldmention that for most people who aren'taccustomed to taking much vitamin C ifyou were to take 6 to eight grams ofvitamin C in capsule or powder or pillform chances are you're going toexperience some significant gastricdistress some people can build up tothat level or take it with food in a waythat doesn't cause that gastric distressbut many people will experience gastricdistress there's been a lot said aboutvitamin C and its other potential rolesin our physiology and I don't want totouch on those now because it may havesome interesting roles in other aspectsof our physiology but I have to say thatin scouring the literature on vitamin CI encountered a recent paper so this waspublished in 2023 and the title of thispaper is retraction extra dose ofvitamin C based on a dailysupplementation shorten the common colda metaanalysis of nine randomizedcontrolledtrials what is this paper that wasrecently published why is retraction thefirst word in the title Well turns outthat the metaanalysis of nine randomizedcontrol trials showing a small butsignificant Improvement in the outcomesfor colds and flu or reduction inprobability of getting colds and fluthat study was retracted and it wasretracted on the basis of multipleinstances of an error in which theplacebo groups had been double countedin Trials more than the two interventionarms so there were some serious dataanalysis flaws in that metaanalysis nowthat is not to say that vitamin C is ofzero benefit for reducing theprobability of colds and flu but mustsay provided that you're gettingsufficient amounts of vitamin C fromyour food intake maybe you're also get alittle bit in your vitamin mineralsupplement or if you take a foundationalsupplement like ag1 or something similaralmost certainly you're getting enoughvitamin C it does not seem that takinghigh doses of vitamin C and I wouldPlace 6 to8 grams of vitamin C in thehigh dose range is going to be effectivefor treating or preventing colds and fluso more data may arrive in the nearfuture but vitamin C is probably not avery good investment if you're taking itsolely for the purpose of enhancing yourimmune system function and staving offcolds and flu now what about vitamin Dwe hear a lot these days about theimportance of having sufficient vitaminD levels and ideally everyone would gettheir vitamin D levels measured byregular blood test I do get my bloodwork done every 6 months I find it beincredibly informative tells me what'sgoing on below the hood in ways that Inever could be aware of where I not toget that test but I realize that there'sa cost to those tests and not everyonecan affordthem I think most Physicians would agreethat supplementing with anywhere from ath000 to 2,000 IU of vitamin D per dayis probably safe for most people andwill buffer that level of vitamin D intheir system such that they're unlikelyto be deficient and unlikely to farexceed what's safe in thebody however there are people who needhigher levels of vitamin Dsupplementation in order to achievesufficient amounts of vitamin D fortheir mental health and physical healthI mean vitamin D is involved in a lot ofdifferent processes in the brain andbody now it is clear that people who arevitamin D deficient so these are peoplewhose vitamin D level levels have beenmeasured oftentimes have diminishedimmune system function and are moreprone to acute respiratory tractinfections there's a very lengthy andvery interesting review entitled vitaminD supplementation to prevent acuterespiratory tract infections systematicreview and metaanalysis of individualparticipant data this is a beast of athing um I did read it all very veryinteresting many manystudies the exact takeaways from a largereview like this of 20 randomizedcontrol trials is a little bit tricky Imean they did conclude that vitamin Dsupplementation did reduce the risk ofacute respiratory tract infection amongall the participants however the degreeof prevention was small to moderate insome cases they did point out howeverthat just because people with low levelsof vitamin D tend to get colds and flumore often than people that don't doesnot necessarily mean that vitamin Ddeficiencies are the reason for that forinstance we know that people that getregular sunlight exposure and aseveryone knows I'm a big big proponentof getting sunlight in your eyes asearly as possible in the day afterwaking up and if it's cloudy out to geteven more time outside if you can and ifyou can't get access to sunlight forwhatever reason to perhaps invest in a10,000 Lux light tablet you can findthese online at reasonable cost you know$100 to $200 in somecases getting sunlight sets in motion ahuge number of different thingsincluding increasing the amount ofvitamin D in your system but a bunch ofother things as well increases incortisol increases in dopamine increasesin serotonin that Cascade toward andrelate to improved immune systemfunction so what is the takeaway here Ithink that for most people supplementingwith a th to 2,000 international unitsof vitamin D it's probably safe howeverif you need more vitamin D you won'tknow that unless you take a vitamin Dtest that is you measure the amount ofvitamin D in your bloodstream and somepeople indeed need 5,000 to 10,000 IU ofvitamin D per day but you don't want tooverdose yourself on vitamin D that isif you already have sufficiently highlevels of vitamin D in your system andyou're getting sufficient sunlight wellthen taking 10,000 or more internationalunits of vitamin D could possibly bedetrimental I think it's fair to saybased on the metaanalysis and reviewthat I mentioned a moment ago and theother papers that I was able to gleanthat vitamin D itself is unlikely to bethe sole protectant against colds andflu but it's probably a good thing toinclude in your general kit of nutritionand supplementation tools if your goalis to keep your innate immune systemfighting off colds and flu sufficientlyother things that perhaps support theinnate immune system are going to be asI mentioned earlier the things thatsupport the gut microbiome so those lowsugar fermented foods maybe a Prebioticprobiotic capsule maybe something likeathletic greens ag1 although certainlyyou could achieve sufficient microbiomesupport from Foods if you're careful andintentional about the foods that youselect now the other compound orsubstance that we often hear about in"

helpfulfor colds or flu but we've been talkingabout vitamin C we've been talking aboutzinc vitamin D making sure you'regetting your sunlight supporting yourmicrobiome and so on and so on onecompound that I'm guessing most peopleperhaps have not heard of but that isvery interesting that in fact I've takenbefore and that I stock in my supplementcabinet in case I feel like I'm comingdown with something is an acetylcysteineor Knack what is Knack Knack is aprecursor to glutathione what isglutathione glutathione is the masterantioxidant it's involved in reducingwhat are called reactive oxygen specieswhich build up in cells that are verymetabolically active reactive oxygenspecies build up even more in cells thatare under stress or a body that's understress and it also has the property ofreducing reactive nitrogen speciesreactive oxygen and reactive nitrogenspecies significantly increase underconditions of infection and havingsufficient levels of glutathione is agood thing now netal is used in certainclinics overseas and in the US as a wayto treat cystic fibrosis because it'salso a mucolytic and cystic fibrosis isthe buildup of fluid in the lungs and amucolytic substance is something thatloosens up the mucus and allows it toflow more readily out of differentcavities of the body including the lungsthe nasal passages and sinuses andindeed last winter I did unfortunatelyget a cold I told you about once every18 to 24 months I get a cold and it wasa pretty nasty 1 I was feeling supercongested at first I thought it was anear infection pretty quickly I realizedI had a cold and I was feeling socongested I wasn't sleeping well and itwas suggested to me to take anacetylcysteine I ended up doing that ata dosage of anywhere from 600 to 900milligrams three times per day so it wasa 600 to 900 milligram capsule dependingon which brand I purchased a lot ofdifferent versions of this out there onthe market I took it morning latemorning and afternoon and indeed it is apowerful mucolytic the mucus just startsflowing out of you you better have anextra box of tissues handy and thatgreatly relieved the pressure in mysinuses and the reason I liked usingKnack is because I've actively avoidedusing decongestants that one canpurchase over the counter mostdecongestants are of the Alpha OneAgonist variety what's an alpha 1Agonist it causes Vaso constriction thatVaso constriction can be beneficial inpreventing some of the intensecongestion that one gets when you have asinus infection or a cold or a flu butthen when those decongestants wear offoff one tends to get a rebound increasein congestion and it's really painfulheadache Etc in addition someover-the-counter decongestants can behabit forming not necessarily addictivebut habit forming and they don't seem tohave any other positive health benefitsso I prefer not to take decongestant ifI can avoid it I had a very goodexperience with Knack and the use ofknack and acetal cysteine as adecongestant and also as a way toprevent getting colds and flu is not anentirely new idea in fact there's apaper dating back to 1997 entitledattenuation of influenza-likesymptomology and Improvement ofcellmediated immunity with long-termanical cinee treatment now in this studythey looked at people who were taking600 milligrams of anal cysteine twiceper day for 6 months and what theyobserved is that the people who tookanical cysteine had a significantlylower probability of Contractinginfluenza now this is but one studythere have been a few other studies andunfortunately there isn't a large bodyof research looking at Knack as apreventive for colds and flu but thedata in this paper are interestingenough and I was compelled by themenough to seek out a physician who Inoce it was answering my prompts onsocial media about what do you use forcolds and flu and when I put that outthere as I mentioned I got thousands ofresponses on both Twitter X and onInstagram and one particular physicianwho happens to have a YouTube accounthis name is Dr schwell he's a medicaldoctor he works in an INT Ive care unitand he deals with a lot of patients whohave different strains of flu in fact hewas the one that cued me to the factthat this year there seems to be a fairnumber of H1N1 flu virus going aroundand remember the H1N1 flu virus whileit's not you know deadly to everyone itcan be quite severe in some people so wedo want to be on the lookout for andtrying to avoid getting H1N1 if wecan I spoke to Dr schel he was verygenerous with his knowledge about anicalcysteine he did acknowledge and I'llacknowledge again here that it would begreat to get more randomized controltrial data on netal cine but we did talkabout this paper this 1997 paper and hedid mention that he and other cliniciansthat are forced to be in the hospitaldealing with patients all through thewinter and all year long they're gettingbombarded with cold and flu exposure allthe time that they meaning he and someof his colleagues deliberately takeanical cysteine as a preventative to tryand reduce the probability of gettingcolds and flu and while we don't want tomake too much of any one study or anicdata which is what we're describing whenI tell you about a physician who told methis or what I did and experien that Ithink it is worth paraphrasing the studythat I mentioned before NAC preventedthe symptomatic forms caused by herethey're talking about the ah1n1influenza virus quite efficiently sincethe large majority of infected subjectsin the placebo group 79% developedclinically apparent disease versus only25% in the knat group in other otherwords Approximately 80% of people in thestudy who did not take an acetylcysteinegot influenza whereas only 25% of thepeople who were taking anical cysteinecontracted influenza so that's a fairlydramatic difference and certainly thefact that anal cysteine has been shownto increase glutathione that's itsprimary mechanism of action as far as weknow and the fact that increases inglutathione are generally healthy andgood for us and the fact that anicalcysteine is still available legally overthe counter in the US at least currentlyit is some years back as you may haveheard the FDA called for removal ofnetal cysteine from over-the-countersales that I should point out was basedon the fact that certain supplementcompanies were making claims about netalcine as a treatment for hangover andmaking a bunch of other claims for whichthere was no real data but eitherbecause the FDA was effective in gettingthose companies to cease those claimsAndor because of advocacy groups whichworked very hard to try and keep netlineavailable for over-the-counter sales asfar as I know at least right up untilprior to recording this episode netalcysteine is available for sale over thecounter so whether or not you decide touse netal cysteine as a preventative andthere again the dosage is about 1,200milligrams per day divided into twodifferent dosages of 600 milligrams eachor if you decide to take anal cysteinein the manner that I did which was notas a preventative but once I had a coldcouldn't fight it off apparently got thecold decided to take 900 Mig three timesper day avoiding that intake close tosleep because it did disrupt my sleep ifI took it too close to sleep because ofthe way that the mucus would flow soreadily you know essentially I know itsounds gross but I felt like it wasfilling up the back of my throatso-called postnasal drip but it feltlike post naal waterfall and I decidedto restrict my intake of anical cysteineto earlier in the day only and of coursethere's the third option which is thatyou opt to not take anical cysteineuntil more randomized control trials arepublished or not take an Cal cysteine atall because you're of the sort thatthinks okay with some sleep a hot showera good meal some chicken soup maybe alittle garlic who knows maybe you havesome other tools and techniques that youlike you like that ginger tea lemon Etcmaybe that's all you need and if that'sall you need and that's all you want inorder to deal with a cold or flu be myguest I certainly am not here toconvince anyone that you have to take acertain supplement but I did feel like Iwould be remiss if I didn't cover whatare generally referred to as theso-called preventatives and treatmentsfor colds and flu things like zincvitamin D vitamin C we now know thatunfortunately vitamin C gets a you knowprobably a D minus or an F at least asthe data stand now but there are theseother things like zinc and potentiallyan acetal cysteine that can bebeneficial in shortening the duration ofcolds or flu and perhaps even helping usavoid getting colds or flu all togetherif you're learning from and or
