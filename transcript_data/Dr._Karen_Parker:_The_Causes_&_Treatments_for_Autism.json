and science related tools to the general public in keeping with that theme I'd like to thank the sponsors of today's podcast our first sponsor is eight sleep eight sleep makes Smart mattress covers with cooling Heating and sleep tracking capacity I've spoken many times before in this podcast about the fact that sleep is the foundation of mental health physical health and performance now a key component of getting a great night's sleep is that in order to fall and stay deeply asleep your body temperature actually has to drop by about one to 3\u00b0 and in order to wake up feeling refreshed and energized your body temperature actually has to increase by about 1 to 3\u00b0 one of the best ways to make sure that those temperature changes occur at the appropriate times at the beginning and throughout and at the end of your night when you wake up is to control the temperature of your sleeping environment and that's what eight sleep allows you to do it allows you to program the temperature of your mattress and sleeping environment such that you fall and stay deeply asleep easily and wake up each morning feeling incredibly refreshed and energized I've been sleeping on an eights Sleep mattress cover for almost 3 years now and it has dramatically improved the quality of my sleep so much so that when I travel and I'm at a hotel or an Airbnb and I don't have access to my eight sleep I very much look forward to getting home because my sleep is always better when I sleep on my eight Sleep mattress cover if you'd like to try eights sleep you can go to 8sleep.com huberman to get $50 off their pod 3 mattress cover eight sleep currently ships in the USA Canada UK select countries in the EU and Australia again that's 8sleep.com huberman today's episode is also brought To Us by element element is an electrolyte drink that has everything you need and nothing you don't that means zero sugar and the appropriate ratios of the electrolyte sodium magnesium and potassium and that correct ratio of electrolytes is extremely important because every cell in your body but especially your nerve cells your ner neurons relies on electrolytes in order to function properly so when you're well hydrated and you have the appropriate amount of electrolytes in your system your mental functioning and your physical functioning is improved I drink one packet of element dissolved in about 16 to 32 ounces of water when I wake up in the morning as well as while I exercise and if I've sweat a lot during that exercise I often will drink a third element packet dissolved in about 32 ounces of water after I exercise element comes in a variety of different flavors all of which I find really tasty I like the Citrus I like the watermelon I like the raspberry frankly I can't pick just one it also comes in chocolate and chocolate mint which I find tastes best if they are put into water dissolved and then heated up I tend to do that in the winter months because of course you don't just need hydration on hot days and in the summer and spring months but also in the winter when the temperatures are cold and the environment tends to be dry if you'd like to try element you can go to drink element spelled lm.com huberman to try a free sample pack again that drink element.com huberman today's episode is also brought To Us by Aeropress Aeropress is similar to a French press for making coffee but is in fact a much better way to make coffee I first learned about Aeropress well over 10 years ago and I've been using one ever since Aeropress was developed by Allan Adler who was an engineer at Stanford and I knew of Allan because he had also built the so-called aobi frisbee which I believe at one time perhaps still now held the Guinness Book of World Records for furthest thrown object and I used to see Allan believe it or not at parks around paloalto testing out different aobi frisbe so he was sort of famous in our community for developing these different Feats of engineering that turned into commercial products now I love coffee I'm somebody that drinks coffee nearly every day usually about 90 to 120 minutes after I wake up in the morning although not always sometimes if I'm going into exercise I'll drink coffee first thing in the morning but I love love love coffee and what I've personally found is that by using the Arrow Press I can make the best possible tasting cup of coffee I don't know what exactly it is in the Aero press that allows the same beans to be prepared into a cup of coffee that tastes that much better as compared to any other form of Brewing that coffee even the traditional French press the Aero press is extremely easy to use and it's extremely compact in fact I take it with me whenever I travel and I use it on the road in hotels even on planes I'll just ask for some hot water and I'll Brew my coffee coffee or tea right there on the plane if you'd like to try Aeropress you can go to Aero press.com huberman that's a r o

            "text": "be here this is going to be perhaps one of the longer conversations that we've been able to have over the years um in part because whenever I see you on campus we're headed in our respective directions but I'm very excited because the topic of autism is one that is on a lot of people's minds and I think the first question that always comes up it seems is whether or not the frequency of autism is indeed increasing or whether or not the field of medicine is is getting better at detecting what was always there over time do we have any clear answers to that well I think it's a multifactorial answer so we're getting better at detecting autism right so in the past we were diagnosing kids at nine or 10 years of age right and now clinicians are able to reliably diagnose kids um at two to three years of age right so there's more people um there are pediatricians have autism screeners now so when you bring in your baby and over the first couple years of life you're filling out screeners that are looking for autism symptoms right so so there's just a lot more awareness around autism but the rates have increased to now 136 us children have a diagnosis of autism which is over two years ago it was 1 in 44 so 1 in 36 wow I feel like it was just yesterday when it was 1 in 80 but is 1 in 36 um the average across Bo and girls um does it skew differently if you look at just male births versus female births yeah that's a great question so autism is male biased and prevalence so you have and again the studies veryy I mean it's it's worth noting that autism is a highly clinically heterogeneous disorder which means that if you met one kid with autism you've met one kid with autism right so so we have to bear that in mind as we have this conversation but you know different studies show that about for every one girl there's three to four boys that are impacted by autism so there's you know differences in the prevalence rate and also there's different monitoring sites so the way in the US that these data are generated is the CDC has 11 monitoring sites across the country and so they they follow um children and then that's where we um that's where the prevalence rates come from and they release new prevalence rates every you know few years so if Physicians are able ble to detect autism early say in a 2-year-old or a three-year-old have to imagine that they're working off of tests that don't rely heavily on language because even though you can get you know some verbose two and three year olds most two and three-year-olds don't have a very extensive vocabulary um and I'm guessing that they're also relying on things like visual gaze um among other things um we've already made clear that this is um not a discussion to allow people to diagnose themselves or others but um with that said what are some of the diagnostic tools that people use you know um is it language is it Vision or does it present as um you know abnormal auditory processing maybe you could give us a sampling so autism is um a behavioral diagnosis right so unlike other areas of medicine where you might be able to take a blood test or there's other sort of tools it's all a behavioral diagnosis by um an expert so usually um a psychiatrist or a psychologist and they look for two core features so the so this is based on the DSM um five and there the two core features are pervasive social interaction challenges and the presence of restricted repetitive Behavior but there are a lot of people with Autism who have anxiety there are a lot of people with sensory challenges there are a lot of people with seizure disorder um Sleep Disorders so again it's each person with autism has this sort of unique collection of traits and you know that's how they get diagnosed we're going to talk a lot today about "

            "text": "multiple spectry spectrums is it spectrums or spectry what someone will put it in the in the comments on YouTube we know that for sure please let me know I would like to know what is the plural of spectrum spectrums um you know because when we hear the word spectrum we think okay there's a spectrum of severity right and in fact I have some experience with um severe autism not in my family but where I went to undergraduate University uh UC Santa Barbara down the way from that school was the Deo school which was a school which um has been there for a long time that um parents would send their kids if they were quote unquote severely autistic it was actually where um Dustin Hoffman went to um study for his role in Rainman and the uh the kids who were really delightful they used to come into town every once in a while to the coffee shop where I'd study and they would also continue on from there to Kmart which is why the Dustin Hoffman character would say gotta go to Kmart gotta go to he would do that repetition right that Kmart was down the road from our you know our College housing and the Deo School those kids were literally in a um away from home facility full-time and I spoke to some of the parents at one point and they were at that facility meaning the parents had sent them their children away to live there full-time of course they'd get visits and they'd get visits home um because they were I suppose we could say at the far end of some spectrum that made it at least to the parents idea impossible for them to be at home okay now at the other end of the spectrum if one is just simply thinking in terms of severity I know people who have self-identified as a autistic that's how they've referred to it so I feel comfortable um saying that they've said I am autistic um and they seem pretty high functioning meaning they have driver's licenses drive cars are in healthy relationships and manage life apparently well um they have some traits that yes I would agree are a little bit different right so this is where we get into neurode Divergence right um but I guess the point is you know should we think about autism as on a spectrum or given the fact that there are these um kind of collections of different traits could there be a spectrum of severity also a spectrum of um you know more stereotype behaviors um another spectrum that intersects with that that has to do with you know obsession with a particular topic you know you could imagine that there are you know 50 or 60 different Spectra or spectrums I still don't know which one to say and that when we talk about the Spectrum we're really talking about something that's in multiple dimensions and not just one line that goes from severe to mild does that make sense yeah I mean I think this is where understanding the biological basis of behavior would then allow us to be able to say you like here's these different dimensions right but not understanding the biology you're left with okay we're are we lumpers or Splitters like how do we think about this because autism is highly heritable so there's about 40 to 80% of autism is um is genetic right so these vary wildly right but the but the common thinking is that the majority about 50% of autism is um is associated with common genetic variants and so the way that we've always thought about this is that there is this you know autism is largely an inherited polygenic condition and but what I mean by that is that you have a lot of common variants that are additive and so if you think about this collection of common genetic variant that underly the Spectrum right so if you have less of a dosing of some of these common variants you might see somebody who's a lot more who's higher functioning like you said and if you end up with one of these single Gene High penetrant um disorders you might see severe intellectual disability and sort of lower functioning on the other end of the spectrum but I think that there is a lot that we don't know and what you're bringing up I think underlines you know sort of an issue with autism autism which is common for many brain disorders which is like if you don't understand the underlying biological basis it also gets very difficult to diagnose and treat right and that's where we are with a lot of different you know psychiatric and neurodevelopmental disorders to date has there been any specific neural network that we can point to and say Ah that's the neural network that seems to be different in people who are on the autism spectrum um I saw a study published recently that seemed to point to the idea that the genes that are altered in autism um at least include a large number of genes that are altered or the proteins that are the consequence of those genes are altered and exist at the synapse at the connections between neurons and I'm asking it that way because you know some years ago I was at a talk on autism at Stanford and someone raised their hand and says um do we even know that autism is a brain issue right could couldn't it be an issue of you know the immune system or the cardiovascular system which at the time seemed like okay gosh of course it's but wait then you stop and you think that's a really good question right how do we know it's a it's a challenge of the brain right I think that's a great question right and there may be people talk about just take for a moment that this is a brain disorder how do you study it in people right so you know it's very difficult to get access to either cerebral spinal fluid which is a fluid that bathes the brain um brain tissue biopsies it's very hard to get people especially children that are really impacted into a brain scanner right because they can't sit still they may have sensory issues they don't want to go into a scanner right so a lot of the tools that neuroscientists or or psychiatrist have to think about looking at the brain are um limited right and then and then the other part is how do you model so the other way we might think about getting access or or thinking about model systems what we need to do is think about the control animals and we need to make sure that the species that we're modeling them in has um features of control humans if you will so we need to have complex cognitive abilities we need to have complex social skills we need to have an organism that has Vision as its primary sensory modality right potentially sleep consolidating so we need to think about all of those and and the the tricky part I think until fairly recently was that we were doing all of this work in Mouse models and you know the control mice just fundamentally lack many of the characteristics that are needed to model you know autism with Fidelity right and I think that's you know when we look at drug development pipelines about 50% of preclinical failures so that would be something that's tested in an animal that works and then fails in a human clinical drug trial 50% of those failures can be attributed to poorly selected animal models and so I think part of where we we will be getting traction is picking you know developing sophisticated models as a sort of point of entry into being able to understand some of these things that are really difficult us studying people yeah such a key point and um for those that um have not heard of pre-clinical models pre-clinical models are non-human models so it could be Mouse could be nonhuman primate could be flies or worms for that matter but uh we're going to talk a lot about non-human primate preclinical models um and the work that you've been doing and of course also the work that you've been doing in humans um the other animal um the other private the other primate right exactly I love to remind people that we're primates um Old World primates um thank you for doing that so you've been talking about the genetic "

            "text": "influences on autism and of course genes in the environment interact right it's never nature or nurture it's always an interaction and that isn't just about the epig genome it's also just about the fact that nature impacts the genome and our genome impacts the way that we interact with the environment Etc so what is the role of the environment in autism both the frequency and the presentation of autism right so I mean there are again lots of different epidemiological studies so um Advanced parental age uh prematurity severe prematurity is a risk factor for autism um maternal illness during pregnancy um so there's there's a bunch of different things that have been associated with an increased risk for autism in terms of environmental influences and how they can intersect with Biology um one of the things that I was really struck by in the early 2000s that at least by my read of the literature hasn't really gone anywhere was this idea that was proposed by pashco who used to run the neurobiology department um at Yale um expert in brain neuro anatomy in non-human primates and in humans embryology um really luminary of our field and he had a series of papers exploring how the migration of neurons during early development you know it's you and I both know but most people out there probably don't know because we haven't covered this in the podcast um it's not typical dinner table conversation you know when you when an embryo when a human embryo is developing the the neurons are born at one location and they migrate out some distance to their final um resting place where then they grow out their connections and connect with one another and that process of neuron neuronal migration is oh so critical for the eventual wiring of the brain and rakes had this idea that perhaps and I really want to emphasize perhaps that the more frequent incidents of autism might be correlated with the increase in early prenatal ultrasound and he had these papers published in number of really high-profile journals including proceedings of the National Academy and Science and elsewhere showing that in a mouse model if you do Ultrasound with each successive ultrasound you got more migration errors right so there to me was a you know an interesting example of of the environment frequency of ultrasound and cell migration having some sort of interaction but it seemed like it never went anywhere it never got tacked to okay you should keep in mind the number of ultrasounds that you're getting for your child and of course ultrasounds are critical for for pregnant women to get because they can Stave off a number of developmental issues and they're super important but you know we've heard about ultrasound you know it within the scientific literature and then occasionally we'll hear other theories about okay it's having two parents who are both engineers and then we'll hear oh you know it's um you know toxicity in the food environment we've heard you know hypothesis about vaccines or the the adant that the vaccines are contained in you know in that large cloud of the has anything really um emerged from them as like okay there really seems to be at least one major risk factor environmental risk factor because I feel like all those theories I come up get some popular press bunch of papers are published sometimes those papers are retracted like in the case of the vaccines um and then the theory kind of dies yeah so is there any specific environmental influence on autism that we can say yes they're really seems to be something there yeah I I mean it's a it's a really spectacularly good question I think the tricky part about it is that every single person that comes into a trial has a different genetic background right and so until we can have these a priori stratified trials where you could then you know as a good scientist you would only manipulate maybe one two variables at a time right but when you're doing these large epidemiological studies because you can't it's very difficult to do experimental studies right especially with developing children um I think that's an incredibly difficult study to do right so there's been an interest in this field of there's these neurogenetic syndromes that have high penetrance for autism which basically means that you could have a disorder um or you know another genetic condition let's say it doesn't have to be a single Gene but that a lot of those kids tend to also get an Autism diagnosis and so there's been work and like so for instance fragile X is a good example where because autism is so diverse in terms of clinical presentation that let's say you have a medication that could work for a handful of kids in the trial you may not be statistically powered to see it right so so you know the way I think about the autism world is there's so little we don't know so think about being in a dark room and you have a flashlight and you only see where you shine the light right and so if you think about a very heterogeneous genetic heterogeneous study it's going to be very difficult to tease out these pieces because an environmental risk factor um might be a driver for one kid but not another right and so I think what we need to do is to have these genetically defined subgroups of individuals and then be able to test the G by Gene by environment interactions or in this genetically defined group of individuals um can we test this certain medication to see if it's beneficial for this subgroup of children got it so you you mentioned fragile X which um we know um presents with autism like symptoms in some cases and then I think of another disease like um Timothy syndrome a mutation in an L Type calcium channel which um for those of you that don't know what these cell type calcium channels are they're they're not just important for the function of neurons in the brain they're really important for the function of neurons and other other tissues including heart tissue right so um kids with Timothy Syndrome have cardiac issues yeah and they have autism so you know I think it's important for us to kind of explore this a bit because in most people's minds you know kids with autism have autism and occasionally they'll have other issues you know gut issues or heart issues or um muscular skeletal issues but we often think that that's the consequence of the autism but often times that they have multiple things going on and the autism actually could be secondary or independent of the other thing that's going on so this is what leads me back to this idea of a spectrum you know is you know is it possible that what we call autism is actually like 50 different disorders or 50 different conditions depending on what one wants to call them um I mean what is autism really I mean is it it's what does it really center around what and I I think here maybe it's useful to go like do we go to the diagnostic criteria like how do we decide if a child has autism if they also have a bunch of other things that are challenging them I I think that that's The $64,000 Question right and and and again in other areas of medicine so if you think about let's think about cancer biology right like decades ago somebody would come in with cancer and you would hit them with radiation chemotherapy and that was the best that we could do right but with the invention of a lot of molecular tools you can remove a a tumor and you can do molecular profiling and even you know have personalized medications made right to attack that t tumor and so you know know what's really tricky when you have a behavioral diagnosis that's not biologically defined you you see a lot of heterogeneity so it's incredibly difficult I think to answer this question because we don't know how many kinds of autismsocial people people I've heard clinicians say well that's not really autism right that's a piece of fragile X right but if it's a behavioral diagnosis and they meet be behavioral criteria it becomes this weird circular argument right so like until we really understand what autism is I I I think that it's going to be very tricky to start you know subing different aspects of the condition as we all know quality nutrition influences of course our "

            "text": "think about the work that you've done in terms of trying to tack the biology of social communication and behavior yeah right those things interact not just language but also Behavior to autism in humans using non-human primate models and then of course to also discuss some of the work that you've been doing in humans and we can't have that discussion without first having a discussion about two neuropeptides that I think most people have heard of at least one of them and I think there's a lot of misunderstanding about but you're going to clarify that for us which are oxytocin and vasopressin so before we dive into the uh the important work that you've been doing on vasopressin in particular but also oxytocin and autism what are oxytocin and vasopress really okay so they're these small little peptide they're nine amino acids long are very tiny they only differ by two amino acids and they're these ancient peptides that are hundreds of millions of years old and in almost any species studied um whether it's the current version you might have vasit tocin or other Mosin which are um sort of precursor forms in other species but they're highly evolutionarily conserved and they're involved in social behavior um in pretty much any it could be egg laying it could be you know but but reproduction and social behavior across the philogenetic tax so house cats make vasopressin and oxytocin humans obviously make vasopressin and oxytocin and pretty much every other species that has to interact with and connect with other members of its species especially mammals right so oxytocin and vasor pressin are pervasive and Maman species do the different species tend to make oxytocin and vasopressin in similar brain areas and tissues um yes but not completely overlapping but I I think the thing that the the beautiful mystery about these and the infuriating piece of them is that because they're so structurally similar um they can have similar effects and they there's four receptors that they bind to so if you think about a hormone or a neurotransmitter so oxytocin vasor pressent if you think about them like a key and a receptor like a lock and you have to put them together to open a door open Behavior they can bind to these four receptors so it can be very difficult to disentangle which one is acting and at which receptor and where in the brain oh so oxytocin vasopressin are chemically similar yes interesting yes and uh where would you say lies their greatest um output Divergence which is just nerd speak for um is there an example of something that oxytocin does that vasopressin doesn't and vice versa yeah okay so what's really fascinating is these two neurotransmitters or hormones were discovered for their peripheral effects which basically means not in their brain but somewhere in their body and so oxytocin's involved in um uterine contractions and milk let down and so was during lactation so people sort of always thought of it as the female hormone and then vasopress has um at least in the in the peripheral system has been involved in um urine regul like urinary output regulation blood pressure um and so we only knew about their their physiological roles as their sort of classic hormones for decades and what was interesting is these um like naming conventions are fascinating medicine right so you could name a virus after where it was first found right or it could be named after somebody who discovered the disease like Alzheimer's for instance is a good example and what was interesting oxytocin was only named once vasor pressin was named twice so it's either called Arginine vasor pressin or anti-diuretic hormone and so it had two different names and so as you can imagine sometimes genes are named twice and so somebody in cancer is studying one Gene and somebody and autism is studying another and they're not even communicating because they don't even realize that they've at least historically now we have all kinds of Gene annotation sites so it's less likely to happen now but but what was fascinating is they were these hormones were named oxytocin is Greek for quick birth so for decades people only appreciated their physiological roles but but there were neuron anatomist saying hey so these are both made they're made in a lot of different places but the the the action sort of happens in the hypothalamus where they're made and there were anatomists that said wait these sort of project back into the brain what are these doing in the brain and one of my favorite historical stories was um I had a mentor um uh a colleague like an you know who I didn't train with but he was um a real source of wisdom to me for many years and his name is Court Peterson and he told me this wonderful story about this duuk oologist named Peter claer and um Peter was studying ulet so sheep and goats and he wrote a story of paper in 1971 called Mother Love what turns it on and um you know one thing about science is I love going back and seeing where do the Pearls of Wisdom come from and so he wrote this and said you know oxytocin is orchestrating all these events of motherhood and there are sheep and goats in particular that have offspring that are precocious meaning they're basically born ready you know within an hour they can run with the herd unlike our species which is altricial meaning we have very helpless infants and mom needs to bond really quickly with that baby if it's going to be running around and you only you know from an evolutionary perspective you want to be investing in the baby that's yours not somebody else's right and um he hypothesized that it was oxytocin that was being co-released into the brain and during milk let down that was what turned Mother Love on and that was really the beginning of this whole field of thinking and so that opened up thinking about oxytocin in rodent maternal care and a variety of other instances can I just briefly interrupt you because I find this so interesting and I know it's interesting to everyone listening as well because you know yes and thank you for making it clear that oxid doin has many different roles um but this role of Mother Love and bonding to infant um has me needing to ask whether or not the idea was that oxytocin is released in the mother when she interacts with her own baby um and that leads me to the question is oxytocin also released in the baby um in reaction to to the mother and how long is that effect lasting because in order to have a pervasive bond with that baby and not just some other baby and of course we still have visual cues and you know we know our baby versus another baby most instances um there are rare exceptions or perhaps not so rare exceptions but leaving those aside you know the mechanism that would allow for mother infant bonding and infant mother bonding by way of oxytocin presumably is something that is literally changing their brains saying it's you are the are the center of my life right and the baby of course is saying well you are my life because you are the source of life right certainly for the early part um early part of life and that nowadays it seems that that that can extend well into the uh the teens and 20s for some people but um you how how is oxytocin working is it is it working over the course of minutes hours is there some specificity of this baby and this mom that links them in in some more pervasive way I mean how is oxytocin doing this magic of bonding yeah I mean it's it's very species specific right so I think that and you need to think about like The evolutionary history of the species right so if you think about sheep or goats the early studies that were done are you um The Passage through the vaginal Canal was what you know so you would activate oxytocin receptors that way but if you gave an oxytocin antagonist meaning you would give into the brain something that blocked the oxytocin receptors so if the oxytocin is being released into the BL brain but you have a pharmacological agent blocking its ability to bind to its receptors these sheep and goats wouldn't um bond to their baby for instance so literally the passage of the baby out of the vaginal Canal triggers the oxytocin pathway the release of oxytocin as in lactation does too nature is so beautiful because if you had to pick one event yeah to trigger the release of oxytocin if oxytocin's role is to create bonding with offspring that would be the event because that's a tough one to mistake right right but but what I will say because I think you will you know to avoid you getting attacked on Twitter or wherever you might I'm GNA get attacked anyway if not if not for this discussion then another one but I'm tougher than I like so um but it's really species specific right so if you think about our species and a lot of primate species we live in these extended family groups and that's how we evolved and so unlike a goat or a sheep that might live in a herd where there's a lot of non-relatives we lived in a community of relatives right and so we and we do all kinds of care of extended relatives and so you wouldn't necessarily expect in a primate species where you have this long rearing history where help from the family and and biparental care where where sort of everybody sort of like it takes a village to raise the baby we readily adopt in our in primate societies right and so you know um like I had a CE I mean I'll tell you something personal I had a C-section um and uh had I had a lot of postpartum complications and so lactation didn't work out that well for me one of my friends would say um I massive um DVS and Pulmonary emop and so I almost died after my son was born the first time and so I didn't have a vaginal delivery I couldn't DVT thrombosis yeah and it was sort of like welcome to Motherhood and I was in the ICU and um had to get a filter put in um an inferior vnea filter to um stop me from dying because the I had scattershot clots all over my lungs and so I didn't really you know I didn't I I didn't do a vaginal delivery I had a C-section and I wasn't really able to lactate and man I love that baby right so you know I can give you know what I will say is um it's really different in primates and we don't really understand how bonding occurs but what I will say is that bonding between a mother you really need to think about the evolutionary selective pressure so I was an evolutionary biologist before I found Neuroscience right and so I really everything I do I think about from an evolutionary perspective um so but it it is um many people go into the oxytocin V oppressing field because they have a lot of questions about social interactions right like I think if you think about us is being social is actually one of the one of the core characteristics of our species right so social interactions are rewarding from infancy they Keep Us Alive as you mentioned right and so I think it's not an accident that the way we think about disorder in our species is many disorders are disorders because of lack of social connectedness right so it could be something like autism where you know there's these pervasive social interaction impairments it could be something like drug abuse where you know you you a risk factor for drug abuse is feeling you know socially disconnected and alone right um social um isolation or loss of a loved one is a very strong predictor of the onset of a stress related depressive anxiety disorder in terms of when and how oxytocin is released you mentioned um mother infant bonding um I think you said yes that the infant is also releasing oxytocin we think um so it's it's bidirectional um we think I think most of the work has been done in mom would be and and again this has not been really done well in primates right so we're extrapolating this information from species that have different evolutionary histories than us right so it's go sheeps um Prairie vs mice rats so what do we know about the role of oxytocin in humans do I mean we know it's there yeah we presume based on the animal models that it's involved in mother infant bonding um and presumably romantic partner bonding at least you hear that a lot um it was unfortunately nicknamed The Love hormone yes um and the reason it's unfortunate it was is that while that might cue attention to oxytocin and I'm you know a big fan of people paying attention to biological phenomena it uh it discards the other and many roles of of oxytocin but yeah what can we say about oxytocin in humans if anything like do we know that it does I mean we're just so we're assuming based on the animal models that it does something I mean this is very different than like dopamine where there's tons of animal model data but we know but they brain Imaging where we know where dopamine is expressed and do we even know where oxytocin receptors are expressed in the human brain presumably that information is is out there recently but again there's a lot of specificity and I think if you're thinking about disorders you would then have to study those specific subpopulations right and and you need you know a lot of this work has been done so you have to think about how do we study it right so the best way to study it would be to have radio tracers where you could then which we do have for dopamine and and other compounds where you would then go and see where after somebody's performed a task do we see you know um activation right or uptake um there are some Imaging studies they're usually done giving intranasal oxytocin um and then you basically ask questions about okay we give you oxytocin and trenas which presumably enters the brain there's we could talk about reasons why we think that um and then we have you perform on some task right and so you know there's evidence if you give oxytocin it diminishes the amygdala's response um to fearful stimuli right so that it might have this sort of pro-social effect and and it was actually data like that that caused people to start thinking um initially about oxytocin and those are data on humans that's right it reminds me that there was this brief moment where oxytocin wasn't just being discussed as the love hormone it it was being discussed as the trust hormon right also um far too simple heuristic but but again I think it's cool that the you know that the the Press picks up on these things and at least tells people about what's being discovered and we just always have to be careful that not um uh have it leads the assumption that that's the only role of a given of a given hormone so um it can reduce apparently it can reduce the output of the amydala in some way this brain area associated with um threat detection um and so you could imagine how that would bias the person toward being more pro-social right um have there been studies exploring the role of oxytocin in making autistic children more pro-social and behind that question I suppose is the assump you can verify or or not that autistic children are less pro-social than other children um is that true um or is it that you know autistic kids are just maybe more pro-social with the one friend they really really like um I happen to know some kids uh with autism or however you want to phrase it and um they have close friends and they seem to really like those specific friends a lot like they seem very happy when they show up at the door and like all all the Hallmarks of you know healthy social mind but it is true that they are uncomfortable in in groups and where there's a lot of noise a busy birthday party is overwhelming for them but you see them playing with one or two friends and like you could see all that and assume okay it's just kind of an introverted kid actually kind of reminds me of me you know I mean I don't have a problem with crowds but I I much prefer to be with a small group of friends or one close friend so I hear you I'm that way too right so um you know how do we think about this um okay well I would say the social features of autism are interesting right and so you might have there were there was an attempt a long time ago like 1979 there's a woman named Lura Wing who tried to subtype the social features of autism right and so there could be people um that are socially avoidant and really just don't want to have social interactions there could be kids that are um active but odd which means that they have an interest in being social but maybe they don't read social cues right and they interact in ways that other kids don't understand or make could cause bullying right and sounds like Junior High School yeah exactly um and and that's often why um you know some autistic kids do better with adults right because adults know how to sort of Channel um discussions with somebody who might be a little socially awkward right but there's different phenotypes I mean uh people having a disinterest in social interactions could be that they're highly socially anxious right um that making eye contact makes them anxious you again that's another caveat um there have been some studies administering oxytocin to individuals with autism and again these are these single dose studies so the first studies that were were done were looking at single dose oxytocin in males because some of the and we can talk a little bit about why oxytocin versus vasopressin which vasopressin actually would have been my choice um based on the animal literature and we can talk about that but vas oxytocin was given to males um partly because it wouldn't the idea would be that the of Target effects in the peripheral nervous system I.E milk let down uterine contraction are not going to happen in males right and so that it was deemed that they might be safer subjects males are often also the the go-to for research studies as you may have talked about on on your podcast before too something that fortunately is changing thanks to a mandate by the uh by the NIH correct um I I had to just kind of um smile slash um raise my eyebrows a little bit at the idea that you know the the assumption that oxytocin administered to males yes one can see why it wouldn't cause milk down or uterine contract but um but of there could be other peripheral effects ofto and males but they had to pick they had to pick one so they went with males okay so um and there is this higher incidence of autism in males so it's not a terrible place to start you just would hope that they would also do the the experiment on females but um so they're doing this by nasal spray so intranasal one dose correct and for reasons that I don't understand it's 24 international units and I think maybe somebody did the first study using it and you know this is how science happens right and it worked and so then everyone uses that protocol and so then there's been a lot of studies looking at um you know there's one reading the mind and the eyes so can you look at pictures of somebody's eyes and then ask what is the emotion that they're feeling right after receiving this or Placebo um where's your eye gaze going in a picture right so one of one of the theories is that people with Autism May at least a subset of them lack social motivation so maybe they're not looking in the places like eyes where you rece receive a lot of social cues that are relevant to social communication and so some of these early studies showed that a single dose of oxytocin in people that were um had high functioning autism so they were verbal like you said they could come in for studies and that it looked like it had some potential Effectiveness and so there became a really strong interest in the field to think about oxytocin potentially is a therapy for autism and is oxytocin available over the counter does it require prescription I I mean you see sites that are selling it but that doesn't mean anything these days right um there's gry Market there's all sorts of stuff going on um but I know people that have used oxytocin um there's actually a market for and by the way folks I'm not suggesting this but someone the other day told me that they've been regularly taking um uh oxytocin ketamine nasal inhalations um as part of their work with their licensed therapist on um like PTSD type stuff relating to let's just call it relational trauma okay um so that's happening um but let's just think about oxytocin alone for the moment um are parents of of autistic kids able to like buy oxytocin nasal spray no so so it would need to be written like the prescription would be need to be written by a um by a physician um and it's not on the market right so there's one thing we should say is there's only two drugs that are approved by the FDA to treat autism and they're both antis psychotics which they um they treat Associated features like irritability and they have off Target effects like weight gain and and and you know so we don't have any medications that are currently approved in the US or anywhere else for that matter to treat the core features of autism interesting and um unfortunate um and hopefully that will change in the not too distant future um do we know that children autism people with Autism because I'm going to just sort of assume that um autism is stable over the lifespan um like if a child is diagnosed with autism are they going to be an adolescent and adult with autism so I would say that in a lot of cases autism has lifelong impact but there are people who outgrow their diagnosis um you know there are people who respond well to behavioral therapy um I mean obviously it's not the Cure All for everybody there's lots of people who go through intensive behavioral therapy and probably see minimal benefits um but I mean it's certainly something that occurs in childhood for the diagnosis occurs in childhood and it you know for most people will then be present across the lifespan so we could say people with Autism because each study sometimes we'll have adults sometimes you'll have teenagers sometimes you'll have kids I'd like to take a quick break and "

            "text": "people with Autism assuming they meet the criteria for being autistic at that at that moment um have lower natural circulating or active levels of oxytocin because you know it's one thing for a nasal spray to um of oxytocin to improve social functioning it's another um to know that it that the effect is addressing an underlying biological deficit yeah that's it's such a great question okay so we should unpack that because there's been a lot of work in this area so the first question is where are we measuring the oxytocin right so we mentioned oxytocin has all kinds of effect in the body as well as the brain and it's released into the blood but it's also released directly into the brain and there's variable evidence about if you measure it in blood is it a readout of the brain or not right or should you be looking at something like spinal fluid that's maybe a a better biochemical proxy of the brain um most studies so what I will say is there were there's been m a handful of small studies where there has been some you know there's been some benefit Maybe no benefit small effects we did a study that was a small study at Stamford and it was based on um Mouse genetic data and I'll I'll sort of walk you through what we did um so there's multiple Mouse models of these neurogenetic syndromes where um people have social impairment right we can Qui quibble about whether that's autism or not but that they have social impairment and so that there are this um fragile X Mouse there's a PR willly syndrome Mouse which is the magile 2 Gene that um gets manipulated and then there's a catnap two mouse and in all of those instances when you genetically modify those mice you see a reduction of oxytocin in the hypothalamus and what's interesting is that um in those instances where you see this genetic modification you do see lower blood levels in these genetically defined models what's really cool is you can give oxytocin across development in those models and at least in the cat to Mouse you can restore oxytocin neuron number to equivalent of control animals suggesting that oxytocin is doing something in these oxytocin deficient animals right so these are not an oxytocin Gene manipulation but these are these syndromes where you see as a consequence of manipulating genes for these syndromes that oxytocin gets knocked down right and so our thinking when we went into our clinical trial was what if um its blood oxytocin levels that there going to be a subset of individuals that just make less oxytocin humans and that maybe those are the individuals who could who stand to benefit the most from treatment and so we were the first group um to ask you know across this range of individuals who showed up and we did in all the trials that we'll talk about today um these are done with my colleague Antonio Harden at Stanford who's a child psychiatrist um and we always have double blind meaning that the investigative team is blind and that the um or unaware I should say they're unaware of treatment and then the families and the children are unaware um and then they're randomized meaning there's an equal chance you could get either drug or Placebo um and they're and they're controlled right okay so we asked if we know what your pre pre-treatment pre-treatment blood oxytocin level is who's going to benefit from treatment and we found a couple really interesting things one was that the lower your Baseline so your pre-treatment blood oxytocin level you showed much greater benefit from the oxytocin intervention these are children one one intervention one nasal spray this was four weeks sorry I should have clarified this is four weeks of treatment being um administered oxytocin twice a day okay and um and and so we saw Effectiveness there may sorry to interrupt so much but just uh males male and female subjects we did but again you know because the autism is male biased and prevalence even if you make this heroic effort to over recruit try to get more girls in and um in in the study we usually try to aim for the prevalence rate because it's difficult to get girls just because there's fewer of them got it okay but um boys and girls were included they're taking oxytocin over the period of several four weeks and if they started off with lower Baseline levels of oxytocin you observed a benefit of the oxytocin treatment in those individuals what about the individuals who had normal to high you didn't see much benefit right and so that was a a cue to me to think that there may be a subset of individuals that you know for whatever reason they have lower oxytocin and they may stand to benefit more from treatment and none of the prior studies had looked at blood oxytocin levels and so what we had thought was that well maybe if everybody had measured Baseline blood oxytocin levels maybe some of these you know maybe there would have been more um positive outcomes so but there's there's a lot of controversy in this field about whether oxytocin is a treatment for autism right so after we completed that trial there was a large multi-site um what's called a phase three oxytocin treatment trial that was done at I think five sites and they gave oxytocin for an extended period of time um and they showed no benefit um and and were they looking to see who started off with low levels of oxytocin at pre-treatment so what was interesting about that study um and there were a lot of issues with it was that um oxytocin is something where you have to if you look at it it degrades it's like that's kind of what I joke about right so you need to take it we take when we go in we have like these really intense protocols right so you go in and we have vacutainer tubes that are cold and we put them on ice and then the FLOTUS takes the blood from the child a lot of technical gymastics yeah and then we make sure we spin it in a centrifuge cold and then we pipe head it onto dry eyes so like so we have very minimal loss of the signal and so if you don't adhere to those rigid protocols which is very difficult to do across multiple sites um it can be very difficult to get an accurate read of oxytocin and so I think for me it's still an open question um they didn't see that blood oxytocin predicted response um in that study um the data weren't provided in the paper it was just said that they didn't um but it's still an open question and so that you know maybe that is the way if you give it acutely like in those early studies we talked about that maybe oxytocin you know diminishes Spar we know that oxytocin decreases um the stress axis the hypothalamic pituitary um adrenal axis and then it can diminish anxiety in animal models so we that's well established um and in a former life I was a stress researcher so I've spent a lot of time thinking about this but but it's sort of the sad thing is is that once you have a negative trial it um there isn't a lot of interest in funding uh the work going forward right and so I think it's still really an open question about if there is a subset of individuals that could benefit from oxytocin replacement therapy right and it's and and until there's money to do that work um we may not ever know the answer well be it will be important for that work to be done eventually hopefully the field will return to it despite whatever Trends might be happening now I think it's important to know for the parents of autistic children um whether or not there were any negative effects of oxytocin Administration in particular in the children that did not benefit from oxytocin treatment the rationale is the following well of course these things require a prescription um if a parent has a child with autism especially if they're young enough that the behavioral interventions could possibly stand a good chance of inducing neuroplasticity rewiring of the neural circuits that underly social connection well then there's this um Tim limited window um in which you know those parents presumably are willing to try most anything provided it's safe right so let's assume and I'm making up these numbers now because I haven't seen this study but according to what you told me that let's say a third of the autistic boys and girls that come in have um low Baseline levels of oxytocin they're the ones that are going to benefit from this oxytocin intervention the other 23ds don't well given the difficulties of measuring Baseline levels of oxytocin most people don't have access to those kind of resources um if it's safe to give oxytocin no matter what well then if I were that parent I'd be knocking on my Physician's door saying hey give me an oxytocin spray because my kid might fall into that onethird category if and only if it turns out that oxytocin is safe to give but if there's a risk profile that doesn't justify that kind of shotgun approach well then I wouldn't do that yeah so um is oxytocin spray safe and if so why doesn't every physician who has a patient with autism give them oxytocin nasal spray right it's a great question and I I know that you know I'm a parent of three children and I know this sense of like you would do anything to help your child right and so I I think the tricky part is that so one thing I will say is that all of the studies and there's been many of them have shown that oxytocin is um is relatively safe in a pediatric population right um the tricky part is I don't know there's Physicians that you know really pay attention to clinical trials and if they don't see a benefit they may not be willing to write the prescription right so until we could identify a group of children that could benefit you know we need to create the opportunity for Physicians to recognize that this could potentially still be a treatment right but that work you know but I I think the tricky part and what I will say is and we can maybe talk a bit about vasor press which you know my feeling is that if I was placing bets and and having to choose between these two my my money would be on vasor press well we are definitely going to yeah um talk about Vaso pressent in detail I mean the reason I I mentioned that hypothetical scenario is just the sense of urgency and in some cases desperation that parents feel and you know time's ticking and if oxytocin's safe then you know um I guess I'll put in my vote that you know parents should at least talk to their physician maybe even hand them the study um to consider but I can also understand the perspective of a pediatrician who says well listen it was a small number of kids that benefited um you're welcome to try it but I don't you know it doesn't seem like the results are that impressive but um you this gets to a bunch of larger issues about you know Medical Care and randomized control trials and the desperation of parents and kids to treat neurodevelopmental challenges um I I just want to ask because it feels relevant in a in a

            "text": "way um you know if ultimately the goal of improving symptom profiles in autistic kids is about improving social cognition and social behavior and that process involves rewiring of brain circuits neuroplasticity is there any reason reason to think that other approaches to inducing neuroplasticity would be beneficial even if they're not in the biological Pathways that are disrupted in autism um I think for instance about the now extensive use of ssris for the treatment of depression some cases it works in some cases it doesn't side effect profiles are a serious concern yeah as I've discussed on this podcast before but ultimately we know that depression is not a serotonin deficiency in most cases ssris or atypical anti-depressants like Ryon Wellbutrin and things of that sort when they work they probably work because of their ability to induce neuro or assist neuroplasticity right right um also the trials on psilocybin are not really about psilocybin they're about neuroplasticity at least the trials for depression right there may be other uses of psilocybin that relate more directly to the effects of psilocybin But ultimately you know what we're talking about here is the attempt to re wire the brain in a specific way whether or not it's assisted by oxytocin or some other mechanism so the question is are there trials happening where people are exploring say psilocybin MDMA which by the way we know increases oxytocin and serotonin dramatically as well as um things like atypical anti-depressants in kids that have autism not because we think that those autistic kids are deficient in any of the neurochemical that these drugs would Target but that these drugs can help rewire the brain and ultimately that's what these kids need right I it's a really great point and I there might be subsets of kids right there might be kids where there would be a medication that would Target other Pathways but that potently releases oxytocin right that and but there might be kids that have an oxytocin deficiency right but I think that that circles back to your point at the beginning or our point is that autism is a very heterogeneous condition and being a to know before you begin a trial right like who am I going to put into it and what is my primary outcome like one measure that I think is going to move the needle right like it kind of requires a crystal ball so there's a lot of guesswork that goes into this um but I would very much like to see I I will say one other thing that um there I have a colleague named Adam guella who's at the University of Sydney and he published a paper a year or two ago now suggesting that oxytocin be may be most effective in kids at younger ages and I I don't quote me somewhere between two and or you know two and five or three and six or something find the paper and put it in the show show notes but you know so it could be to your point about neuroplasticity that oxytocin may be maximally beneficial in younger ages right and if you're if these studies are these Haj podes across ages and across sort of different social phenotypes finding that signal is really important right and and maybe age is a driver or or maybe you know low blood oxytocin regardless of what age you are or maybe in Adam's case if you recruit really young children you're likely to see a benefit just because the BL the brain is wiring up and it's more plastic at you know younger ages yeah that's also a vote um in my opinion um for early examination of kids right like parents really need to get autism screen and perhaps maybe the most important thing is to make autism screening as available and as inexpensive as possible for everyone because of the importance of early intervention even if it's purely behavioral intervention but certainly if it's behavioral and Drug intervention but the clinic wait times are really long right so you have to have a specialist who's capable to diagnose autism and so you could have a clinic where you know you're showing Troublesome features and a parent wants to get their kid into a clinic and you could have a 12mth or or 18-month wait time right and so there are a lot of people that are thinking about are there are there laboratory based tests that we can develop maybe either for detection or clinical referral right so could we come up with a a biomarker panel for instance where we might be able to say wow here's some here's a panel where we think this child is at reasonable risk for developing autism can we make sure they're prioritized for getting a diagnosis right so we can get them an an early intervention but right now we don't we don't have that right so having some sort of laboratory based test whether it could be biological um or if we could do something with ey gaze and there's a lot of companies working on these things now to say this may not you know and and also obviously again autism is always controversial in this field right there's so many different stakeholders a lot of clinicians will say well I don't I don't want a 30-second video clip replacing expert clinical opinion there's good reasons for them to feel that way but I think if there was a way to prioritize people that are in this line um you know we could get diagnoses faster well you wouldn't want false positives but I would think that a 30 second video clip provided itself something useful is going to be more valuable than nothing yeah given the time sensitivity uh what are some of the barriers to um getting this behavioral testing to be not just more prominent but pervasive like it seems to me that well I recall in school they gave us the hearing test we all marched on the bus we get the beep test and you know um you know for hearing um challenges uh we get Vision tests you get the babinsky reflex test not the moment you come out of the womb but pretty pretty soon after I mean why isn't this stuff um happening uh for autism um for every kid yeah it's not scalable right so you these interviews with parents and the tests that you do can take hours right and and any given clinician even if they're working really long hours there just aren't that many people that are have the extensive training needed to make these expert diagnoses right and so I think that there's you know clinicians that are doing the absolute best they can but they can only see a certain number of of people a week right and does it have to be a physician sorry to interrupt does it or could it could you know could a well trained technician do this yeah well I mean I I think technically it's a DSM diagnos is right so it's usually somebody who has a clinical degree so it would be a clinical psychologist it could be a behavioral pediatrician it could be you know a child psychiatrist or child neurologist but I mean again that requires years and years of training um and if we look in areas where people have fewer accesses access to Resource I mean particularly in impoverished areas the mean age of an Autism diagnosis is years later than in wealthy areas where you know there's many different medical specialist with parents you know that aren't working three jobs and you know can sit waiting around you know and and really Lobby and and really advocate for their kids right because you know if they don't show up for work that day they're not going to get fired from their job right and so I think that you know if there's some sort of solution that allows there to be a more democratic approach to saying we need a really quick way like you said to be able to identify at risk children especially if it's a a blood test or something like that you know it could be incredibly impactful are there human trials exploring MDMA methylene dioxy "

            "text": "so you told us this is a molecule that chemically is very similar to oxytocin um is it manufactured in the human brain and body yes okay do we know a subset of the sites that it's known to be produced and where it's of its actions are and you mentioned the kidney and the anti-diuretic hormone um roles but within the brain like what brain areas have neurons that make vasopressin well or have the receptors for I mean The receptors are all over are all over the brain and again it varies depending on the species and you know the way the receptors are measured or in postmortem tissue right which can be very difficult to get good samples right and so we need to have that caveat going in um but yeah I mean it's it's made in the hypothalamus um and it's released all over the brain and there is vasor press and receptors all over the brain right and um what's really interesting about vaser press and I always sort of joke that oxytocin you know always saw its day in the sun if you will and the vasopress was sort of the stepchild that was like left you know sort of behind and and the reason why I find this fascinating is again like I think back to my you know my my roots as a you know evolutionary biologist behavioral neuroscientist and what was interesting is that there were studies in the early to mid 1990 showing that vasopressin was critical for male social behavior and so um there was work you know there was a variety of people and I I think Rob Minka mentioned this on his on on the podcast he did about you know there's a a group of people like Sue Carter Larry young Tom inso some of these early people and they gave Vasa pressen to male Prairie voles and V vasopressin was what induced um pair bonding um with a a female mate and also paternal care and and as I recall those experiments were done in the context of looking at um polygamy versus monogamy of these Prairie VES um Prairie VES versus like a different species so same um genus but a different species so it might be a Montaine V or you know highly related but these other species so Perales are monogamous the males uh well I mean that was the 50% divorce right yeah that was I don't think it's that bad but I think they're doing better than we are as a species that's true we should look to them for pointers and all the divorce folks are saying wait why' you say better I have some divorce friends that have said divorce is like the greatest thing so we always say like doing better doing worse right um anyway that's a whole other podcast um and certainly not the hubman Lab podcast but or maybe it is but um or will be but yeah my understanding is is that you have certain vs that mate with almost exclusively with one other V for their entire lifespan and then you have other vs located elsewhere um that in those colonies they mate with lots of different well so the males and females have lots of different partners um rais young with lots of different partners mating with lots of different partners and that if you give Vasa presson then you can make the I was want to call them polyamorous but I don't know if they love each other I'm going to answer for more and assume they love each other the polygamous moles not polyamorous but polygamous moles then become monogamous well I yeah I would say that is probably not the take-home message so the take-home message would be they had let's say that there was like the good vs right which are the Prairie VES and they were the ones that formed these monogamous parir bonds dad participates in paternal care with Mom they co- ra babies together and then Dad chases off Intruders right and then there's the more Ace social vs and so these are like the Montaine VES um and um we'll we'll see it's a complicated story but there's these Montaine vs where um males and females live separately females like maybe live on the male's territory the male mes with a few different females absolutely doesn't provide any paternal care at all mom raises babies by herself right so that's these are really the like 1950s versus 2020s yes yes to be to to broadly stereotype to broadly stereotype and if you give okay so for Prairie voles they're sort of primed to form bonds and to be the males to be good daddies if you will and all you have to do is give them a single injection of vasopressin and you know or you can give an antagonist and usually the way they form the bond is through mating right so they you put them with a female they mate they cohabit for a bit there's been all kinds of parametric studies I I can't remember how many hours it takes to form a parabond um but then you can do these things called partner preference tests and then you can say here's the guy that you made it with here's this guy you don't know and you can do it for males you can do it for females and they pick their partner they choose to go hang out with their partner the Montaine BS you know either after meting with somebody May either be equal or maybe they'll even go spend time with the new individual so the cleanest story was that Prairie voles are monogamous Mont voles are not monogamous but in the prairie vs you could give vasor pressen instead of mated cohabitation and you could turn on a like you know a bond with somebody after only living with them for a very short period of time right um or you could induce paternal behavior and I was working with a V species in grad school I think the most interesting scientific experience that I've ever had right and you and I both know this right when you're young you're actually the person doing the work right as you become you know the head of your lab you're mostly writing grants and giving talks right and then you get to hear about the super cool things that every in your lab is doing right eventually the the members of your laboratory kick you out of the lab they literally say like get out of here you're leaving things in the wrong place whereas initially you're telling them hey that's in the wrong place within a year or two for me I think it took about four or five years but by about year six right I was um demoted to my office to just write grants and write Pap I was told that one time I was back there and I tried to waigh and I was like so excited what they were working on and they basically just said go write grants and bring in more money right like that was kind of their attitude like we get to be the ones who get to do the cool stuff so back when I got to actually do the science um I remember I had this species where and I and again I told you I came at this from an evolutionary perspective so these were called meadowes and I found them very interesting so when I showed up in my thesis advisor lab she I said I really want to study oxytocin and vasopressin and I really want to study VES and I know you have a v species and she said why I don't have prairie vs I have these meow voles and I'm studying them because they're so sensitive to light and they changed their behavior based on light and I she said well you can do what you want but our grants basically have to have a circadian component and so she said you got to work that in but then we kind of struck this deal so I was hanging out in the animal rooms and I thought it was really fascinating so she had animals that were either on short day lengths or long day lengths so the mimicking some um summer and winter and I was noticing that on winter day lengths the the males were hanging out with the females and when the female had a litter he was like participating and I was like whoa these are not supposed to be monogamous animals and so I went into the field research and they were doing all these radio telemetry studies and so like if you I we should probably explain what those are putting a little transmitter um under the skin it's painless for the animal but that allows the researcher to um monitor the behavior of the animal remotely without having to you know put them in cages and stuff so and so this is like under field conditions and vs are everybody's favorite snack so they have like a very limited lifespan in the wild I mean like on the order of months and and so like if you have a short lifespan like you should just keep reproducing right and so what was interesting is at the end of the summer days as you're going into winter territories collapse and males are found with females and they co- ra babies it makes sense if it's you're going to have a litter and mom needs to get up to go eat you need somebody to sit there and warm those babies or they're going to die because they're going to freeze to death right so I started saying like wow I think these metales are good dats like I'm noticing this and so I told my thesis adviser I want to study how oxytocin invasor press can maybe this is involved in tracking these evolutionary mating strategies and so again like the coolest experience I ever had was on these males that were housed under short day length so they were like winter males um I was able to put Vaso pressent directly into their brains and and it was like turning on a light switch and they ran around the cage picked up all these babies put them in a nest and huddled over them and if you put a placebo into their brain nothing happened and so to me I always filed that away in you know in the back of my mind of like wow Vasa pressin is this really interesting hormone um and maybe someday I will I did a postto on something else but it was always you know back in the back of my mind of I really want to return to this it's so incredible that a eight amino acid long peptide could basically turn these um relatively negligent fathers into very attentive fathers yes yeah it was fascinating right that I mean it just speaks to the power of the peptide baso pressent also speaks to the power of brain circuitry it also speaks to the idea that brain circuitry is often sitting latent in the background you know ready to be activated that it's not just about neuroplasticity and building up a new circuit that some forms of neuroplasticity are about unveiling what's what's already there and that peptides can act like switches um which you know kind of makes sense on the one hand but um I've never heard of a result as dramatic as that so um I'm presuming you're going to tell us "

            "text": "that that then LED you to go back to vasopress and explore its ability to induce good parenting and negligent fathers I haven't studied that yet um no well so I think that you know my mom always says Chance favors the prepared mind and so I was doing my postto at Stanford and I got recruited to stay on the faculty and I you know had been doing work in stress vulnerability and stress resilience and I really and I love doing that work but I still felt this tug of you know I had spent all this time in a Psychiatry department where I was surrounded by clinicians and I realized that a lot of the stuff that I was doing had clinical relevance right and so sometimes you sort of meet the moment right and so right as I was transitioning to to have my own lab in my department there was uh a bunch of stuff going on so there were a lot of very dedicated parents who were lobbying for funding for autism research because it was horrifically underfunded really horrifically underfunded wow I mean at rates of one in 36 well not at the time right so it was it was 1 in 150 or whatever it was back then but there were all these parents and and I I mean again they're heroes in my eyes that they ad ated so much for their loved ones and so there was you know they started forming parent Grassroots organizations that have culminated they all started joining together which is now Autism Speaks um and then there was a man named Jim Simons who runs um one of the most successful hedge funds in the world and he decided wow I'm gonna you know there's let's put money into autism right and so does he have a personal link to autism I you'd have to ask him because often times not always but often times when you hear about um wealthy donors um devoting a lot of money to one area of science there's there's a familial thing there you know a member of their family or a close friend has this Challenge and they they really want to see that challenge absolutely I mean a lot of money I've gotten for my lab from philanthropist and what I will say is the most impactful work I've ever done is through philanthropy right there are crazy ideas that no funding agency ever touches right um but yeah so they put they both put um a lot you know there there was a lot of emphasis and so because the s's Foundation started issuing requests for applications there was a group at Stanford that formed and it was um um a clinician with a basic scientist and my chair at the time said well you know almost nothing is known about the biological basis of autism why don't you go I'm going to introduce you to the the the head of child psychiatry you should go talk to this group and so as I Was preparing my slides and realizing that you know social interaction impairments were a core feature of autism I thought wow you know these neuropeptides May really be you know um a part of this puzzle and so that's actually really how I got pulled into um autism research was was through that and it was I I was you know everybody at the time was very interested in oxytocin and you know I remember thinking so we actually did probably the most definitive blood oxytocin um study because there was this idea again like this marketing campaign of like the oxytocin deficit hypothesis of autism and you know given how clinically heterogeneous autism was we got money actually from the Simons foundation and we did the first study with maybe 200 kids um and what we were able to show was that blood oxytocin was not a marker of autism right so it wasn't like there was a bimodal distribution meaning two completely nonoverlapping levels of oxytocin in people with Autism people without autism so the lower your blood oxytocin levels um actually regardless of who you were you could be a child with autism you could be an unaffected sibling with autism or you could be a unrelated control child and it was the lower your blood oxytocin levels the greater your sort of social difficulties and the slopes you know were different they started at different points because the behaviors were obviously different but that's what got us thinking about our clinical trial which is that blood oxytocin level is not going to be this great differentiator between people with and without autism right but we might be able to find a subgroup who could benefit from treatment but what I like so much about your approach the way you described it is that it it sets aside we don't we don't want to say discards but it sets aside this thing that we call autism yeah which is already hard to Define and diagnose and there's all these different spectrums and you're trying to F and just says okay children with autism have challenges in social cognition social behavior social bonding yeah so do adults with autism for that matter matter let's just focus on that yeah and not worry so much about whether or not somebody is diagnosed as Autistic or not and just focus on what are some of the potential neuropeptide deficits or overexpression of neuropeptides that may in some way relate to those Social Challenges right and then one can Circle back to the question about autism in collecting those data but it also points to this idea that like when we when we go after a disease like Alzheimer we can often miss the possibility that Alzheimer's while it has you know deficits in cognition and memory could also be a bunch of other things like a metabolic disorder of the body and so maybe you go after a particular symptomology yeah and try and attack that and you might actually potentially treat or cure multiple diseases it's a very different approach and I I hope um people are catching on to the the subtlety but also the the the potential impact of that um because if I heard correctly you said there are people who are not autistic who have social functioning deficits and they too have less circulating oxytocin right so I would say we haven't studied people where we brought them in and characterized it right so these are typically developing kids but what we did is in the abilities that are typical of a controlled child we still saw that gradient right and so I think it just sort of begs the question about you know what is oxytocin's role in human sociality right I mean I think there's just so much that we don't understand about both of these molecules um in terms of their disease liability if they're low or their healing potential if we are you know able to use them as modulators um of other therapies so how did you move from oxytocin to vasopressin um you mentioned "

            "text": "that everyone was was all excited about oxytocin still the one that we hear the most about yeah although after this podcast episode and when I start blabbing about vas oppress to everybody um you know maybe that'll change but it's I think it's going to take a lot more than that but um maybe it's because the name isn't as there's something about oxytocin that like kind of sounds like the love looks like the love hormone but like vasopressin should be renamed right well it should be called something else like not anti-erotic hormone not vasopressin I mean you're going to tell us how critically important it is perhaps even more important than oxytocin for autism and social functioning so I don't know by the end of this podcast we'll we'll come up with a new name I it's needed right well I'll put it out there um uh okay so how did you get to vas oppressor okay so it was interesting with oxytocin because we didn't you know and again I was skeptical that we would see these big group differences but you know it was a little bit of like okay you know what everyone's saying this is not going to be the big solution right um and so I actually came at it from the work that we did in monkeys and so I think I mentioned previously at the beginning of the podcast that there were a lot of limitations that I saw and then sometimes if you come into a field you know when you're you're a little bit of an outsider right like I'm not a clinician I don't see autism patients but I also I have this really strong interest in social behavior and the biology of it and so I I was thinking about what are what are things that we need to do to better address the challenges in autism so one of them was why are we looking in blood right like if you look at neurological conditions there's been a lot of progress made by doing biomarker Discovery in cerebral spinal fluid right so like the the biological substrates or or clues of markers of say um various forms of Dementia or um or MS were for first found in spinal fluid right because it's the it's the fluid that bathes the brain in the spinal column and so if you're looking for the bio chemistry of an illness that's the closest fluid that you can get to the brain right so blood draw just won't do it maybe right so that was part of my thinking but then there was the issue of the animal models right so there was drug after drug after drug that was tested in mice and they failed in human clinical trials and so it made me start thinking could we develop a primate model um of naturally occurring social impairments right so can we because in autism these social impairments are if you will naturally occurring right and so you know this is these spontaneously occur in children um and so it made me wonder could we identify monkeys in a large Colony that have social impairments in and after talking to to clinicians who who treat these children can I spend a lot of time validating a monkey model where there will be monkeys that have features that look like they have direct relevance to core autism symptoms um and so what I did was there's a um primate Center the California National Primate Research Center and so what we did is so I think I mentioned earlier that there's these surveys that can be used to look at autistic traits in the general human population right and so we refined one of these and we did what we call back translate so basically it's an instrument that's used for humans and then what we did is modified it to be able to to use this rating scale in reesus Max which are an old world monkey and I know you're familiar with them and um and I was interested in looking at Old World monkeys because they're some of the closest relatives to human that are used in biomedical research and and um as I mentioned previously these autistic traits are continuously distributed across the general human population and that this genetic uh say let's call it genetic liability which is a fancy way of just saying that we think that there's a there's a genetic risk that underlies this Continuum of Behavioral traits right so if we think that that's true in humans and in one of our closest relatives and we think that some of these genes create proteins that then are what sets up the developing brain to develop in the way that autistic brains develop so let's just assume that that's the premise that's what we went with can we find reesus maacs that are just living in large outdoor colonies and identify animals that might be good um models for autism and the answer is yes we could do this all kinds of different ways one is we could just take people and um score monkey behaviors outside their cages while they're interacting with their peers we can use rating scales and again the rating scale we Ed it's called the social responsiveness scale so this is called the MAAC social responsiveness scale revised it's a mouthful um but what it allows us to do is measure autistic like traits in monkeys and we can also bring monkeys in for experimental test to see where their eyes look or how do they perform how do they respond to videos of other monkeys you know if they're making affiliate of overtures do they um do like you know you know ma goo which is a a positive response well they do that right I I um I'm going to apologize for interrupting you again but I just have to tell people this because I spent time up at the UC Davis primate Center as a graduate student and and by the way what we're referring to here are non-invasive observational studies at least thus far so these are monkeys living in large uh exclosures not enclosures large exclosures um forming colonies and social relationships and um you know I think anyone that sees monkeys at the zoo and we all learn that monkeys go and they don't if you want a monkey to like you you learn this working with macx um first of all they don't the affiliative call is a they do this really nice and the little ones the babies I spend a lot of time with these monkeys and the little ones they do this thing where they go I used to I used to nurse the little ones every once in a while they and they're just you know just like makes your heart melt I think there must have been an oxytocin dump at that moment that's probably happening right now but if you want the monkeys to like you you have to give an affiliative facial gesture which is not a smile that's actually an aggressive gesture so as Karen Dr Parker just showed you it's lip smacking which is so if you see a monkey at the zoo and you want it to pay attention to you you're going to have to lip smack and if it doesn't either you're not doing it right or it just doesn't like you exactly right great all right thanks now we'll go back to the uh the study of uh or the establishment of this really key experiment right so then what we did is we identified these these animals and we spent a lot of time so one one of the things that I do as one of my areas of expertise is validating animal model so a lot of like I mentioned like a lot of reason why experiments fail is people will take an animal off the shelf and say oh I'm going to do this right but if you're you know if you're studying a disorder that's characterized by visual issues is it is it the best thing to do in a nocturnal species that has old faction as its primary sensory modality or you're referring to mice right or is it better you know and again I will say all models have value there's all you know there's reasons you just have to you know you basically have to stand by what you're modeling and so I think one of my the biggest issues I have with a sort of mouse phenotyping Mafia is that you know there's this group of tests that they use and they use it in every single disorder right and then if there's a positive hit it's like oh this is like you know this test is really for Parkinson's today but it's for depression tomorrow right and so so my goal was to to devise very specific tests that would allow us to evaluate you know core features of autism in this model and the answer is we found it right so if you you look at monkeys that spend a lot of time alone they have a much greater burden of autistic like traits measuring on this rating scale they have diminished social motivations so other monkeys will come up and interact with them but they don't engage in um social overtures them that much themselves they do less grooming less uh affiliative um behaviors um they in some of the work that we're doing they don't lip smack back and we can talk a little bit about that we did a pharmacological probe and we can talk a bit about what vasor press does to that which is kind of exciting um and so we spent a lot of time validating this behavioral phenotype right to say that we really feel like there are are core aspects of it that are allowing us to model autism right um and I have a paper which if you want to put it in it's all about creating this monkey model and and and the power of of doing it and where it it took us clinically we will provide a link to that in the show note captions I also just want to um throw up my vote for the the fact that you did this work "

            "text": "because again I I don't disparage Mouse model work but we've just seen over and over again that the incredibly small fraction of mouse models that lead to uh valid Therapeutics in humans and that there's just a lot of differences between um primate brains and rodent brains and we have a very elaborate you know frontal cortex a bunch of other circuitry that might if they have the that they probably use it for other things and it's just very hard to com to draw conclusions from those models and and they're they're great for probing um functions that are uh let's just call them more autonomic type functions um and for doing some of the initial investigations but um you know I think while I don't want to see every research lab switch over to primates you know I think one has to be really thoughtful about the kinds of experiments one does with primates at all yeah um this sort of um behavioral assessment and and the identification of a of a primate model for autism seems like a a very good use of of um of Human Resources right well and the other thing I will say is that there were medications that were only tested in rodents that when they were when they were tested in people had really negative consequences I can give you two examples so one is the lamide which was a morning sickness medication that was given to women um that were pregnant um and the safety testing and talks was toxicity testing was done only in mice I didn't know that yes and that's why it went on the market it went on the market in Europe um and there were all these children born with profound lib limb abnormalities when they went back and tested the drug in um marma sets neither rees's monkeys or cinus monkeys an old world monkey they had the limb abnormalities and so all they had to do and again you know I I as an animal lover treat the you know the life of a single monkey or or a single Mouse for that matter an individual monkey excuse me or individual Mouse for that matter as you know as critical I am a species I do think there's a difference between their life and our lives when it comes to um you know what study one does but um but just the idea that these severe developmental defects in humans could have been avoided by doing an experiment perhaps even on one right maret right um and again I feel for the life of discomfort of that maret but um the idea that that could have saved so many human lives it's just striking well and there was also that street drug MP TP that was a synthetic heroin right that caused like overnight parkinsonian ISM right when like I think the dopamine cells were just oblad right but when you went and looked in mice mptp didn't have those effects it was only in primates and other or humans and other primates right so and I agree with you I am an animal lover I I think that we have to be very careful whenever we do any animal experiments right and so you really need to have a good justification I think for any science that's done I will say that upfront um and you know we have this you know new generation of stem cell and organoid work which I think is going to you know allow us to make all kinds of disease progress right so without having to study uh whole animal models or in in complimentary right but I mean I think again I think we need to pick the model based on the question we're asking right and so if you want to have a medication that's safe and well tolerated you know in people um were effective and you want to move the needle on Lex social cognition you want to be testing it in a species that also has complex social cognition look the Netflix show chimp Empire people haven't seen it they should watch it when you watch it you realize they're very much like us yeah and dare I say we're very much like them oh yeah it's uh Far and Away different than watching a bunch of mice yes and I'm not being disparaging of mice I'm assuming they have that mice also have complex social cognition VES also have complex social cognition but it's of the mouse V type and we don't know really even what to look for right but with primates there's you know affiliative gaze there's you know affiliative grooming there's um ostracization of individuals in a troop I mean there's a there's a you know baning taking care of other babies there's all sorts of interesting dynamics that map so clearly onto human behavior and vice versa yeah yeah so you establish this Colony up at Davis um at the regional primate Center "

            "text": "that and where you identified some monkeys that we don't if they have autism but you could see that they were less socially affiliative right and I would never say they have autism like I will say that up front you know they have features that resemble human autism and that allow us to model this right so so we started studying those animals and what we wanted to do was do some biomarker Discovery so what we wanted to ask was are there any molecules that allow us to differentiate these what we'll call them naturally low social or low social monkeys from soci socially competent high social monkeys and so we measured a bunch of different um readouts of neurotransmitter systems that were either involved in Maman social behavior had been implicated in idiopathic meaning autism that doesn't have a genetic cause or these neurogenetic syndromes that we've been talking about um where there's Pathways that are really associated with them and so if we measured a bunch of these systems with 93% accuracy without even knowing what the monkey who the monkey was if they were low or high social we could just put them in the low social or high social bucket and was this by blood draw or cerebral spinal this was it was everything we did Blood we did CSF and we put all these measures into the hopper we did a discriminate statistical analysis which was like a machine learning algorithm where we just said here's all this information help me classify if this individual is high or low social for cerebral spinal fluid is collected by spinal tap correct in my understanding I've never had one um but that spinal tap is of course more invasive than a blood draw but it still is um done as an outpatient thing in humans like you can go in get a needle inserted into the lower spine by by an expert um they're going to draw cerebral spinal fluid I mean not that much more invasive and timec consuming than getting a a needle into your vein for a blood draw right I mean it's it's we think of it as it's technically a little bit more challenging um but their CSF draw humans all the time right so in theory this could map to a human study and it did which we'll talk about cool so we went out and we did this I have this spectacular statistician who's we we spend a lot of time together his name is Joe Garner and um and he is a statistical genius and so he developed this and and we do all of our work together or you know I would say 95% of it we just love working together and he developed a statistical winning winwing strategy to identify what were the key drivers and what was fascinating is in this first monkey cohort it was the cerebral spinal fluid levels of vasopressin that were really what was driving this classification right so if we just knew your levels of your of vasor pressent in spinal fluid but not in blood interestingly um we could pretty closely perfect to perfect classify you as high or low social and so then we replicated that again in another monkey cohort because obviously it's a scientists you always want to replicate your work and then if it was really a biomarker meaning it's a molecule in the body that gives us um an indication of something and in this case it's an indication of your Social functioning we were able to look at um monkeys and we saw that the Vasa pressent was consistent across measurement time so there was a wide variety of Vasa pressin levels but within an individual monkey it was pretty much the same right so that's what you want to see with the biomarker and then we showed that the vasor pressen levels were closely uh linked to uh groom SP grooming uh time spending grooming and as we mentioned I think we mentioned earlier grooming is in many monkey species a critical behavior that solidifies social bonds and maintains them and so the individuals with the lowest CSF phasor pressent levels had uh spent the less time the least amount of time in in grooming grooming other monkeys other monkeys yeah this allopathic grooming is a very interesting behavior and um from watching chimp Empire I can tell you that um new relationships are established in many ways by um monkeys these chimps chimpanzees sort of offering their back for grooming and if another um chimp elects to yes groom that um chimp then it establishes some form of trust and it and it all seems to have to do with proximity like how close are you going to let me get to you vice versa in humans that you know we talk about personal space and there's a whole set of things related to consent in this whole allopathic grooming thing and then if they um you know if a if a chimp misbehaves on on an outing then they aren't groomed by others and they can actually get parasitic infections and it can be very costly uh it's very interesting you know uh to just think of alpath grooming as a as not a um kind of a primitive of language but a whole language into itself absolutely yeah and and also just critical for the species so that was really interesting to me that we were seeing these hints that vasor pressin could be you know really important but of course you know somebody will say and I will say upfront monkeys don't have autism right so then the question becomes does this have what's called translational value so you "

            "text": "know can I see this observation in an an animal model and will it provide fundamental insights into humans right and so I wanted to get cerebral spinal fluid from people um to test this hypothesis because we had in parallel done a study looking at blood vas oppress levels and people within without autism and we didn't see a group difference there unlike this really profound difference that we saw when we looked at spinal fluid and the monkey and again I think I mentioned the blood vasor press levels were indistinguishable if you were higher low social monkeys so there was something about looking more proximate to the brain that was giving us more information than say the blood alone and so I said I wanted to get spinal fluid and like you said people do this all the time how would we um but we're you know it's not going to be a first pass especially when we don't really have any evidence in people to go in for what we would call a research lumbar puncture right and so I had to get really creative about how do I get spinal fluid from children and what we did was we piggybacked on to a clinical indication for um a spinal fluid draw so and and we did this so I tried to get funding for this this is like you know again I mean I think this is important for people to know how science is done right and so I wrote all these Grant applications nobody would fund it they said that this is really interesting it's too high risk you won't be able to pull it off and you know I don't usually back down from a challenge like if I think think something's a good idea and I want to do it I'm going to find a way to do it if somebody if it's impossible that's one thing but if it's hard to do it doesn't mean you shouldn't do it you just have to figure out how to do it and so I always try to see Bridges where other people see barriers right and so it's like well how can I access spinal fluid and so I went around talking to all my friends who were on and Stanford's really wonderful because it's such a small school right and so you're on all these different committees with all these different people and so lot of committees lots of I can attest lot of Comm exactly but it's really because you're on them with people from all different departments I know people in departments that I wouldn't otherwise know um and you get very uh you get to know these people well in these many committees and where we live it's a small community right so like maybe were the experiment Karen maybe there's a I always wonder whether or not there's a larger experiment right not on monkeys not on the the patients or the Clone but like we're maybe we're the experiment right and they're looking at how we interact on committees anyway please continue so I started going up to people that I knew and said hey if you're you're taking spinal fluid can I get a little bit of extra right and of course we got you know IRB approval meaning we had ethics approval and all this and um or you could get the remnant sample and obviously again get consent from the families so we could either get a little bit extra when it was being drawn for a research indication so so they were getting a spinal tap no matter what and then we were just either we're getting a little bit extra or we were going to getting the remnant that they were going to throw out right so you usually take more than you need because you don't want to have to do another spinal tap right and so we were able to go around and I hustled around and got all these people involved to help me we put um hot pink stickers on the lumbar puncture trays so that in the emergency room so if somebody was doing a spinal tap they would call us so we knew about it and we could get you know samples um again under people's consent um so we got all these people involved and we finally got samples from children with autism and children without autism and then we also made sure that whatever they were being worked up for was negative right so we got the the sort of healthiest people we could given that everybody was coming in for a medical reason to have a lumbar puncture and in this in this first study we had seven children with autism seven children without autism and we could nearly perfectly classify 13 out of 14 individuals by just knowing their CSF vasor pressent level Alone um which is pretty remarkable given that there isn't a biological indicator that we a robust biological IND Ator that we know so basically in this relatively small cohort yeah having low vasopress is the biomarker of autism correct and and again and what I will say is in our monkey studies and in our human studies CSF oxytocin level became our control right so in our monkeys there were no difference in CSF oxytocin by group um and then in this first study um there were no differences in CSF oxytocin levels um uh a sample size of 14 is intriguing but given autism so clinically heterogeneous we want to replicate it and so I knew that there was um a professor at the NIH named um Sue swedo who was collecting uh cerebral spinal fluid in as part of a research study because she was interested in immune parameters and fate deficiency so she had children that were medically healthy and they were getting you know just like at ni you get these huge workups right so they were very well-characterized participants so we were able to look at and again we also this is the first time we were able to look at girls so we had a small sample of girls and we had boys and we basically just asked the question can we replicate this and I was very interested in well will oxytocin be what's different in the girls right so maybe there will be some sex specificity here and that we'll see low CSF vasor pressin in the males and low CSF oxytocin girls that was not the case what we found was that if in the individuals with autism regardless of their um biological sex um that they all had lower CSF phasor presson levels than the individuals without autism and because they were so well characterized we were also able to show on a gold standard research diagnostic assessment of autism so it's a an assessment that's used um uh to in a research situation to validate an Autism diagnosis by an expert clinical opinion that the lower your vasopress levels in spinal fluid the greater your um social symptom severity um your clinical symptom severity and then we asked it's like well vasor press's involved in social behavior but it's not really that involved in restricted repetitive behaviors and that was actually the case so it was the CSF Vasa press and track the social symptom severity not the repetitive symptom severity suggesting that there might be other biological measures that could be included as a way to you know have a more powerful way to differentiate people with and without autism um and so then I was really so so that was really exciting to replicate that um and then I had a colleague named um John Constantino who um is now at Emery but he used to be at wasio and I knew that John I had been at a meeting in I think it was 2010 and I found out that he had what I will call Liquid Gold so he had this uh minus 80 uh C freezer um that was uh had a bunch of um neonatal infant CSF samples that he had from Human infants and he had collected them and again this was under ethical approvals and it was basically they these infants came in for something that needed to be worked up that was very rare um but if they had it they would you know they they could die so they needed to get a medical treatment for it but the the vast majority of these children ended up being healthy so it was a pretty healthy sample if you will right and so I knew he had all these samples and I said to him wouldn't it be really interesting if we teamed up and we look at this uh CSF vaser press finding in children before the period when behavioral symptoms first manifest right and so so sorry again to I'm going to apologize every time no no no I just but I think it's important because this was a question that um I was thinking about earlier and I imagine many other people were too you know you find these monkeys that have social uh interaction deficits you find um kids that have social interaction deficits and you see that there's low vasopress in both groups this extends to male and female children but then of course the question becomes well maybe they have low vas oppress because of so many years or even months of social interaction deficits right that the the direction of causality isn't clear and so yeah when you said Liquid Gold you know referring to the um CSF from these infants um taken prior to any opportunity for social interaction Beyond just you know whatever interaction they had with their their mother up until the point the the CSF draw was taken um this really gets at the issue of causality right so it's a quasi perspective you know because it was banked and then a lot of time went by right and so what we realized we could do was and this was a heroic undertaking on John's part so these were um this was these samples were collected back on paper medical records so he had to trace 2,000 paper paper what's that yeah exactly so he had to trace 2,000 I think paper medical records to an electronic medical record and then what we did is we he looked to see who went on to develop autism and who didn't right so then what we had with spinal fluid samples that have sort of been waiting in the freezer if you will and then we could ask you know do individuals who later receive an Autism diagnosis many months or even years later already have low vasopress levels as infants and the reason why this was a compelling question to ask is there's evidence to suggest that behavioral therapies are more effective the younger the child is right and if you think about it if if behavioral characteristics of autism emerge across development you know what if and this was my this is sort of my we haven't we haven't substantiated this yet but this is like sort of my big question what if all these autism susceptibility genes summon interact and converge upon a few common Pathways in the brain right and so for years people have talked about this excitatory inhibitory balance theory of autism but what if vas oppress is one of those Pathways because it's so critically involved in Social functioning and so what I was interested in and so let let's just say for a moment you know your genes are set at Birth what if the Vaso prestent is already low in the brains of these infants and so it puts them on this very different trajectory where you have this cumulative effect of they're maybe a little bit less socially interested and maybe they're not making the eye contact and if there was a way to intervene really early even potentially with a vasopress and replacement therapy that you might be able to put them on a different developmental trajectory so that was my big what if question and what was really remarkable was so I had been asking John hey can I have your spinal fluid samples and and he finally agreed after he saw a couple of those papers understandably he wanted to make sure that we already had shown something in people and animals that were sort of if you will symptomatic with social impairment and what we found was yes this was the case so it was a small "

            "text": "sample it needs to be replicated but individual so infants that went on to have an Autism diagnosis later in life already had low CSF vasor pressent level oxytocin levels did not differ between infants that received a subsequent autism diagnosis and those that didn't so suggesting that we have a biomarker that you know might really be a good readout for you know clinical referral or risk management monitoring incredible so you're telling us that levels of vasopressin correlate with social cognition deficits that right I think that warrants a brief discussion about cerebral spinal fluid I teach neuro Anatomy to medical students so um forgive me for for having to ask this but you know I think of cerebral spinal fluid as the stuff that exists in the ventricles and down the central Canal the spinal cord and provides essential nutrients and uh for neurons and other cell types in the brain but it's also a reservoir for chemicals coming from the brain which is why the spinal tap is useful right um but in the context of a cerebral spinal tap and you're measuring CSF and you're seeing okay lower levels of vas oppress in these individuals with these challenges with social deficits does that mean that they're making less vasopressin does it mean I mean it could have gone the other way too like they're dumping too much vasopressin into the CSF and it's not able to function in the brain like you know what do we know about CSF and what does it mean right well I mean it's a great question so I I think this is just the tip of the iceberg right so I think of the CSF as as sort of like the kitchen sink of the brain right and what we need is real specificity and so I mean my working hypothesis and we'll talk a little bit about pharmacology is that there's a deficiency in um in vasor produ vasor pressent production in individuals with autism but there's a lot of elegant experiments that need to be done to be able to answer this question so we have funding ly to look in um postmortem human brain tissue um to look at um in both blood CSF and hypothalamic tissue where vasopress is made to look at inner relationships right which is very difficult to do but also to see if there's a fewer number of Vaso pressent producing cells and if Vaso pressent gene expression is diminished right because that would help us begin to answer is this a production issue right so if you think back to the Prairie V they're sort of primed to be parental right um or in in my case the mees right but you can do this in any V species well at least the two that I'm thinking of and you put baso pressent into the brain and then all of a sudden it it unlocks this Behavior right so is it possible that children with autism or at least a subset of them um all you have to do is replace vasopress and that there might be a subset of these kids minimally that could benefit from vasor presson replacement if you will is there any evidence for excessive urination in kids with autism which if anyone's going what what why is he asking that if you recall vas supressant is also anti-diuretic hormone um I suppose the other question is could you has anyone looked at levels of a oppress in the urine of autistic kids versus non-autistic kids because it's acting peripherally and um you said blood draws don't reveal any differences um in circulating blood we know that you're urine is filtered blood fair enough but um seems at least worth worth a looky okay so I have this awesome medical student in my lab named Lauren Clark and we with um three different Physicians from different backgrounds so um wrote a perspective piece that's currently under review and it actually asked this question so you know given all these weird medical naming conventions it's possible that this information is existing in information silos in different disciplines right so it raises this idea of if you have low vasopressin so there's a if you really don't have you're not making vasopress you have a disorder called Central diabetes insipidus right which is characterized by excessive thirst um um lots of urination um and and you know bed wedding potentially um and so what we wanted to do was ask has this been missed right so shouldn't there be a subset of kids with autism where we might might be able to look at these other physiological features and say yeah this is the subset we want to be giving vasor pressent to and so she wrote this perspective where we did a little bit of a review and the answerers there's some intriguing um studies that we reviewed in this paper where it looks like and and what's funny is when you read the discussion section it'll be like wow there's all these kids with autism that are drinking lots of water and we don't know why or wow there's a lot of bed wedding but it's not tied to intellectual disability where you might see a lot of bed wedding or something so all of these studies kind of raise this point of like wow this is really interesting um and there's been no big epidemiological study done on this and certainly not any study where people who come at it from brain science and then the the practitioners who are like an endocrinologist for instance which which is where some of these people could show up um are are really connecting the dots so I think that remains to be determined but we are actually about to launch a study to to investigate this right I was meeting with Lauren yesterday about it so um it's a really good question and I hope to have information on it in the not to distant future as I recall alcohol is an antagonist of vasopressin so Al there's a lot of different drugs that could interact with vasor pressent and so one thing I'm interested in is are there any drugs that release vasor pressent as a side effect and could some of them be mobilized to treat autism we also know that like um acupuncture can release phaser and there's been some studies done in Rats on that um and so one question would just be are there any alternative therapies where we can be relacing vasor pressent naturally or do we need to you know do a replacement study where we give you know intranasal vaser press into children with autism right and of course I'm I'm not I want to say I'm not advocating that people go out and do this on their own right like I'm I I'm a big proponent of randomized clinical trials where you assess safety right and efficacy yes science science medicine right but I appreciate you saying that yeah um some years ago so this would be mid90s um there was a small but very active subculture that I was not a part of okay I swear um that were combining GHB gah hydroxy butyrate um and vasopressin as um combination quote unquote sex drugs really yes yeah um and I don't know the rationale for including Bas oppress was in any case whether or not that's by way of enhancing social bonding or a direct effect on sexual arousal itself is still unclear but in any event since we're talking about Bas oppressing maybe you should tell us about the actual science of uh "

            "text": "vasopressin sorry maybe I should allow you to tell us about the actual scientific study of vasopressin um in other words what happens if you give people Vasa press in a controlled environment not the sort of environment I'm talking about but a controll and the one thing I will say because I have people contact us all the time saying where can I get vasor pressent and what I would say is vasor pressen means you know you're having effects on blood pressure you're having effects on really important right vasod right and vas the dosing has to be appropriate you know you don't want people just going and trying this because there could be really severe adverse effects right so that's why we've been studying this in a in a controll clinical trial right so um I teamed up with Antonio Harden who's the child psychiatrist that um I've been working with for years and we did the first sort of first inclass vas oppress treatment trial in children with autism so again this was everyone was unaware of who was on basor press whether it was the family or the clinician who was doing the evaluation um and then it was randomized Placebo controlled um and then we basically gave um vasor presson again twice a day for four weeks um to children they were about 6 to 12 years of age and then we had a primary outcome measure which was the social responsiveness scale we could get into discussions about what a primary outcome measure should be you know wouldn't it be great if there was a biological measure um but this is sort of what had been used in the past and something that the FDA approved us using I was partly interested in using the SRS because we had used it in monkeys right and we had shown at least in monkeys we've never looked at this in people because of you know the lack of available samples but that monkeys in this general population that we've looked at there's a continuous distribution of these SRS scores that relate to the CSF vasor press levels and so what was I wanted to know if we use the SRS as an outcome measure and we're administering vasor presson can we change you know the scoring on this instrument based on our animal data so SRS is social social responsiveness scale corre um without going into a lot of detail because we can always refer people to the paper and I think most people just want to understand the top Contour um the SRS presumably has to do with um how often the kid uh interacts with another kid how often they initiate that interaction versus on the receiving end things like affiliative play um how often they look at one another versus averting gaze um these kinds of things yeah and then there's also um a little bit about restrictive repetitive behaviors so even though it's called the social responsiveness scale there's also an assessment of other features of autism in it but you can sort of think about it as a quantitative way to assess features of interest in autism and this was related to our biology and the monkeys and so then we use this as this outcome measure um in our trial and and you know as a as an experimentalist I have this sort of trust but verify right so you want to you want to see the same thing over and over and over again right like scientists like repetition and so we had Parents fill out um their impressions of what the child's uh Behavior was you know before and after being on the medication we also had a clinician make an evaluation but we also had the kids perform laboratory based tests where they would see like I mentioned that the um reading the mind in the eyes test or we would show them a picture of a a face and say what emotion is this and so we were able to have what's called um converg in validity right so it's a fancy scientific term to say do all these measures that we think should be related are they related and are we seeing the same thing and um the answer was yes so that when we gave children with um autism vasopressin versus kids with autism of placebo the kids who were treated with vasopressin showed um increases in Social abilities on parent report clinician evaluation and child performance on laboratory based tests wow um was that um was that immediate like they they did the nasal spray and they immediately started um receiving and and initiating more social engagement or was this a buildup over time and what I'm getting at here is whether or not this is the reflection of a short or longer term neuroplasticity like where there structural changes in the brain or or is this something that was more acute um we don't know the answer to that so we basically looked at dosing with the idea that we would you know and and again I think we've mentioned this about um limitations on like there's so many things that a scientist would like to do but you always limited by a budget right and so when we started this work again it was like philanthropic shoestring budgets right and so you had to really be laser focused on what are the things that we can do on the budget at hand so unfortunately we didn't do like EEG or brain Imaging or other things that would be I think potentially very interesting to do because you might be able to see an early signature of response right so maybe after the first dose let's say wow like there's some interesting changes that are predictive of somebody who would be a resp responder to the medication and we don't know that yet um but we do know after this 4-week period that we we saw you know these changes and in then in a subset of kids we actually saw diminished anxiety and also diminished restricted repetitive behaviors um so suggesting that the vasor pressent effect may not only be on um social behavior have you ever just wanted to try or tried vas oppress you know I haven't but you're in a Psychiatry Department after all and I not suggesting that members of the Psychiatry Department are constantly testing the drugs that they use on their patients with themselves but but I've had several members of this department of which I'm a courtesy member um member by courtesy any event and we'll see if I'm still am after what I'm about to say uh Dr Carl dth who's a clinician our first guest on the huberman Lab podcast also a phenomenal neurobiology researcher uh David Spiegel um Rob malenka um and others um that I've spoken to you know I think all of whom said you know that they felt as clinicians Rob's not a clinician but anymore right but as a clinician that they felt almost a responsibility to understand the effects and side effect profiles of the drugs that they were giving their patients which I saw not as Renegade or experimental but rather as very compassionate like seeking empathy um so I'm curious have you ever just snuck a little little no no I never have but there is a long history Medicine of people trying out they believe so much in their solution that they go and vaccinate their family with the new vaccine that they've created or they try the medication themselves right so MDMA was developed by Sasha kogan in a laboratory in the East Bay first by a pharmaceutical company in the early 1900s but then kind of disappeared it did disappear and then it was resurrected independently in the in the 19 I think 70s and 80s and then now it's one of the um sort of hot topics items for the treatment of PTSD still in late phase clinical trials still illegal but um self-experimentation is is one of the central themes of Psychiatry frankly yeah I mean I guess I you know it's I Pro I got in trouble in class for being too social right so so I guess I've never it might send you over the other spot yeah yeah exactly who knows but no I I never no and the thing is is that these oxytocin Vasa pressin and again these are done and this is this is something that I think we've hit on over and over again in the podcast is you need to know who's you're studying right what's the species who's the individual you know most of these have been done in you know neuro I mean a lot of the oxytocin and a little bit of the vasopress work the single dose work was mostly done in in what we'll call neurotypical people right just asking can we move around social behavior by just giving this single Drug Administration most people that are neurotypical didn't say that they could tell if they were on the drug or the placebo right so interesting so I think the question really becomes you know drugs have different you know they work differently based on the individual who's taking them so if you have a neurotypical individual and you give them Vaso presson you know maybe they'll self-report that they don't see a difference but if you had somebody who isn't producing enough phas of presson maybe you know they would self-report after a period of time or maybe even after the first dose wow I really see something different right did any of the kids uh report how they felt they just "

            "text": "said like wow I I like playing with other kids more were they self-aware in that way and um also feel free to mention if it feels right to you any um let's let's consider two outlier cases one spectacular result if that you know a kid that went from very socially isolated to you know maybe very gregarious and um but let's also balance that with another outlier the the kid with low Vasa presson who took Vasa presson who for whom there was no significant shift I'm presum that the data set you probably obser something like each of those yeah so I mean what I'll say is that um so yeah I mean there were definitely kids who didn't respond to the medication I mean one thing I think it's important to say and again this was a small pilot trial right we're in the process of replicating this in a much larger sample so you know as a scientist again you want to say okay this is really intriguing and interesting and I've invested a lot in you know this monkey model and then doing all the CSF work in patients to suggests that there may be a there there here but I want to see it replicate um we did have an article um that Stanford medicine I can send you the link um they they were able to I think interview a family that had been in the trial um and so obviously there's patient privacy and you know you have to they have to say it's okay to talk about it but this is a family that was contacted I think they were Anonymous but this is in this report um and they basically said the the dad said that his son was walking around the he was on Vasa presson and his son was walking around a grocery store and he like was looking for him and he turned around and he said he was Gob smacked because his child was you know just talking to making chitchat with somebody like in an aisle and he said he had never seen that happen before um and so you know we do have anecdotal reports like that and I think you know the tricky part is are we we didn't stratify anyone going into this trial right and so the concern always is did we get really lucky in the first trial and we somehow got the the quote unquote right people that entered the trial that we're going to be the ones who would respond to the medication or is this a medication that has sort of broad use in this population and we you know the second trial will be um positive you used nasal spray to deliver the vasopress and and um presumably that gets into the blood circulation of the brain um and supplies neurons with vasopressin but it's very non-specific and I'm not criticizing but if you think about you just putting a bunch of vasopressin into the brain and if people wonder why this is that it's because basically you have neurons of your central nervous system um are part of your factory system and believe it or not right behind your where your nose meets your forehead um the brain is right there there's a little bit of bone and then the brain is is is right there so um one of the reasons you can get in there um and it's easier than an ocular injection or something that wouldn't be a good approach and it's easier than a peripheral in injection into the vein but at the same time I have to presume that this I'm imagining this V supress just kind of like preting through the brain binding to whatever receptors happen to be there you said The receptors are everywhere and then this significant Improvement in social cognition right so that raises all sorts of interesting questions about like what are what relevant circuits are impacted um or is it some Global Inc could it be some global increase in kind of awareness of surroundings um although some autistic kids are overwhelmed by their awareness of surroundings so um yeah what are some thoughts about how vasopress might be working to exert this this really impressive and frankly important effect right so I mean could it increase social motivation does it you know like so let's talk about like how sort of complexity of social um sensory processing is it that were directing attention to social cues where there wouldn't have necessarily been as much iess right um are we increasing social motivation which would suggest from some of the animal studies may actually be happening right um we don't know and I think that's partly when you have other models or if you're able you know to do imaging studies I mean one thing that's been a little bit of a Holy Grail in this field is that if we could get um tracers that are um basically like a you know a molecule that would allow us to inject it into somebody and then visualize the brain like if I'm thinking about a pet trace or a radi liend where you could then ask questions about you know what's happening in the brain can we can we give vasor pressent in the context of a you know functional brain Imaging scan and ask like where is the vasor press and binding what kind of circuits are involved like that needs to be the next step of the work to know like where where our targets are and you you can do something like functional proteomics right where if you know where basa press and receptors are you can overlay that with studies of functional brain Imaging right and that would allow you to say these areas are dense in phasor press and receptors and do we see similar responses in what we call bold signal on a on a brain scan so let's let's be more colloquial about this like do certain areas of the brain light up if you will where we know vasopress and receptors are are densely distributed um in ways that we know are tied to social motivation or or social salience or other things that we think could be moving the needle here um in the trial how is this happening and and I think you know one thing the reason why we did this work is and I think it speaks to what you said earlier is there is an urgency on the part of parents to say you know my child's brain is developing right and and there's a sense of that them you know by the sort of Western model has failed a lot of people you know they look to doctors and say what are what are the solutions and doctors will say well we have a limited number of tools in the toolkit here we just don't know right and so you know one of the reasons why they did that big oxytocin study was that people were trying to get the oxytocin anyway so it was like let's just make sure that this is safe let's see if it's effective and so some of our thinking was you know as soon as some of this work hits you know like it get and some of the work is been covered by the media and so you know our feeling was we can give this intranasal um and we can do it under safe monitoring ways um and so people are going to think about doing these things anyway so let's just make sure that this is safe and let's test this in a rigorous way so we don't know the mode of action but then our feeling is is that you know at least from the initial safety data it looks pretty safe um and you know and so the idea would be and there's a long tradition in Psychiatry if we don't know the the mechanism of action but if we have a medication that can be impactful and improve the lives of people with Autism and we can diminish suffering and people can more readily reach their full potential you know to me it actually seems unethical not to move forward in a way that's scientifically sound Amen to that this seems like a good time to "

            "text": "raise the topic of the microbiome and not as an unrelated topic and and here's why um I've seen a fair number number of studies in Mouse models arguing that in a mouse model of autism which now frankly I have to kind of wonder about the the um Power of that model but anyway the models are out there in the field um that fecal transplant into a host that does have social deficits and rescue some degree of social deficits I don't know if this has actually been done in humans as well and for those of you that are cringing yes they do feal transplants in humans for treatment of obesity and a bunch of other things um this isn't because scientists are obsessed with feal matter it's because um feal matter contains a lot of the microbiome elements um so the microbacteria of the the of the gut um and the reason I'm raising this now is you know one possibility and it it's not mutually exclusive with a brain mechanism is that the administration of vasopressin somehow rescued a vasopress deficiency in the gut so the questions are as follows is there any evidence that vasopress is manufactured in or impacted by the gut microbiome of humans we'll just start with humans since I think most and um because that would that wouldn't be a Smoking Gun but it' be an interesting detective story well okay so the one piece of evidence that I will say that I find provocative and fascinating and one thing I want to say is I I think there's really great work done in mice I don't want to be a mouse Basher so I want to just like sort of go on the record that I'm not bashing other models um if it's a conser so I think about everything from like an evolutionary perspective if a mouse shares a brain structure with a human and it's highly conserved you know Mouse work can be incredibly important and very impactful right yeah my my lab did years of mouse work some primate work where necessary um now I only work on humans um but um absolutely it has it has its uses um but clearly the primate model for social um deficits as it relates to autism you you at least have me convinced that that one has a lot of power let's just say that exactly okay but I'm going to now say there is a really cool Mouse study that was done that I found and there's been you know lots of different studies so there's been mice so there's these like I said these genetically modified mice that have genetic syndromes that are you know where the individuals have social impairments and some of these individuals and again here's a here's a problem with a field often they will measure oxytocin but not vasor pressin right so like they're not often both measured together which I always do now um but there's been some really interesting evidence that in these Mouse models that and and again multiple studies but like certainly low blood oxytocin levels in these Mouse models what and and with the sense that maybe they have some sort of abnormal gut microbiome and then what they've done is they've given a probiotic to these mice normalize their social functioning um and that in there's an increase in oxytocin and in a recent study also vasopressin at the level of the hypothalamus so by giving a probiotic you I believe the oxytocin levels were increased in the blood you saw more species typical social behavior and this was all driven by this upregulation of oxytocin gene expression and also vasor pressent in this very recent study and what's interesting is there's this nerve called the vagus nerve which is uh it's I think it means the wandering nerve vagam it's for Vagabond yeah exactly right and even it's in the gut but it actually has a direct projection to the nuclei and the hypothalamus where oxytocin and vasor pressent are made how interesting yes and so when you sever the Vagas you then in this one study it's a neuron paper um I think it's like 2020 it's a super cool paper and then what you do is you decrease the gene expression and you don't see the rescue of the oxytocin levels or the social behavior in this model so so another words if I interpret this correctly and I'll go look up the paper and provide a link to it um they're they're by increasing the diversity of gut microbiota because that's really what a probiotic does sort of across the board increases the diversity of gut microbiota no one specific ilis as I always say because they all seem to end in ilis you know multiple Iles Iles ilsy here we go again um you upregulate gene expression and thereby action of oxytocin and vasopressin in the hypothalamus but that's a neurom mediated thing it's not as if the microbiota travel to the brain something changes in the gut which activates the vagal pathway from gut to the specific nucleus in the brain and um we know that the vagal pathway is involved because it seems at least partially necessary if you sever that you give a vagotomy then the uh this effect is is blunted or eliminated that's very interesting and and ties the microbiome to oxy invasor Preston production in a neural and somewhat causal way um and makes the data on fecal transplants make a lot of more sense because I always wondered okay so you take a you know taking the microbiota from one animal putting into another animal you're creating you're transferring the millu of the gut but it doesn't say anything about mechanism right so this this is a really cool fascinating and there's also a study I've always wanted to do is you can get a vagal nerve stimulator they used to do them as implants right but you can also get one that you sort of clip onto the ear and I've always wanted to ask if we we use this in autistic individuals and you know could we increase like can we alter social behavior right and would that be something that we could actually measure in the blood especially if we're seeing this this change in these blood levels right are you doing that experiment no but I've always I've I've always thought it would be we we have to get you the to do that experiment and and I know a few times you've raised the issue of funding it's not something we spend a lot of time on this discussing on this podcast but I think what should be abundantly clear to the listeners um throughout the course of this episode is as you mentioned ear you're very determined to get work done you'll figure out a way but the way I describe um finances and and research is that it's absolutely necessary but it's not sufficient you of course have to have the right people in the right lab head directing the work but no money no no project and it and it is disappointing to see that despite the federal budget for research being um you know still reasonable it's not what we would like it to be um it's still very hard for amazing worldclass Labs like yours to say Hey you know listen there's this vagel thing and clearly there's a rationale it's not like you're pulling this out of out of nowhere and um you want to go do this study but what we're really talking about is three to five years of grant writing before you could even initiate that study meanwhile autistic kids are going from Age 2 to 5 to six these are critical windows so if ever there was a um there was a rationale for um you know moving a lot of funding to uh you know I don't even call it highrisk but you know logically sound hypothesis testing for the treatment of autism it's it's now so I'm I'm going to get active on on this front so I won't get into how but you know uh when I get something in my uh in my neural circuits for for talking they tend to not shut down for a while well there will be a community that is is going to be immensely grateful well it seems like um the parents of these kids and the kids themselves could greatly benefit so um you mentioned that the first study on um vpress Administration "

            "text": "that saw these improvements in Social functioning you said a small cohort how many how many kids was It ultimately that you could use data from okay so we had I mean you screen a lot so I think our you know because we had very rigid criteria so we ended up with 17 kids that were on active drug and 13 that were on Placebo and then not a study no and the placebo CH we we always have like a humanitarian open label extension arm which allows for anybody who is in Placebo can get access to the drug so both Antonio and I feel very strongly about making sure that if we're doing a medication trial everybody can benefit from it right so afterwards if they say okay I was in the placebo group but I really want the chance to try this thing they can't but then you also get more data we get right so I think when the families are now aware that their child is on basor pressent and the clinicians are aware you know you really want there's a huge Placebo response rate right and so I mean it's not a placebo response rate here but but we really would want to make sure that our evaluation of the social behavior is done unaware to the medication but you can get good safety data right so so you can have those you know 13 children who were on Placebo we can then also make sure that their blood chemistry Labs look good that their cardiograms look good right and so that also allows us to assess safety parameters in a greater number of children in a fairly broad literature search I was able to find okay microbiome so feal transplant is something that people are excited about as weird and there are trials in people with Autism ongoing in using feal transplants okay oxytocin nasal spray presumably still being investigated by some groups or it's been abandoned well I think it's mostly been abandoned because there's no funding priorities for it right so so I know that maybe in Australia because of Adam's positive findings that I I don't know what his plans are but maybe he's doing work there um there might be a little bit of work with behavioral therapy and oxytocin but this is the problem when there's one big trial that fails the funding just completely dries up so even if there's promise I don't know a single funding agency that's going to touch it got it um and then there's the Vasa pressen Administration work that you're doing right I think it's worth contrasting that work with the Fairly large trial that was done by a major pharmaceutical company exploring the role of vasopress in for the treatment of autism um you could tell us what they did because it's basically the opposite of what you did um and you can tell us the outcome because I think that if anything that study um in advertently Provide support for the results that you observed which is that administering let's say increasing Bas oppress levels in the brain seems to um ameliorate some of the social deficits of autism right so um Ro had a compound called bapin which was a vasopressin v1a receptor antagonist which basically means there's um I think I mentioned there's these four neuropeptide receptors and oxytocin vas are present binding to each other's receptors but the v1a receptor is the one that is um most implicated in social behavior um and so they had and this is the tricky part about when medications are developed in in Pharma versus in academics right in academics there's definitely this transparency we write grants the abstracts are are publicly available we register our trials they do too but a lot of the shall we say early development is all put out in Publications right and then it's also peer- reviewed and there's you know an open trail of why we're doing what we're doing but in a pharmaceutical company you know they have the ability because also they have all the funding to be able to do all kinds of development that may never see the light of day because of the proprietary basis of it right and so you know when you go back to so it's not it's it still is not clear to me why they took the approach of using an antagonist to the main Vaso pressent receptor in the brain um what's interesting is if you go back and you look at the animal literature there are hamsters that if you give them vasor presson they become aggressive right and if you give male Prairie VES vas op press they can become aggressive but let's think about the context that they're doing this in these hamsters that show aggression are asocial they live by themselves if you give them vas oppress and the only social repertoire they have is to you know have sex with a female or to fight a male that they see they have a very limited social rep right and when the Prairie V male is be is being given vasopressin it's often in the context of PR like um protecting his mate and his offspring and so then it's actually species appropriate for him to attack a Marauder male on his territory who's going to you know kill his babies right and so so my thinking in reading the preclinical literature the animal literature was that all right that makes a lot of sense in the context of those species but we've never seen any evidence in our Tri aggression didn't change we also have an aggression measure in this current in the current trial as well but you know for me the vast majority of evidence from the animal literature suggested that Vasa presson was pro-social um and that you know especially given our our CSF findings like over and over across species across studies across ages that we we should be giving vaser presson especially given the correlations between vaser presson in CSF and symptom severity and autistic traits you know the former and people and the latter in the monkeys um and so they had some preliminary studies that I believe were maybe single dose one that they published um but then they had a trial where the primary outcome measure the social responsiveness scale was negative and then they had um some secondary measures that maybe showed some promise and then they were conducting another trial um and then did a futility analysis and I know they stopped the trial and I don't think it was for safety reasons but again you know a lot of this isn't made public right because it's a pharmaceutical company so you know we we will see because we are going to be completing our larger trial you know this year and you know as they say the proof is in the pudding so we will see if you know we can replicate our initial pilot findings well sounds like they got it backwards that blocking vasopress Pathways would just make things worse and that augmenting Vis oppress and makes things better um although that last statement um needs to be supported by this more extensive population well I think you know there's been a lot of speculation and maybe there are people closer to the trial than me who might be able to speak to mechanism but you know I would meet the RO people at conferences and they would come to my talks and I would always ask him like what's the mechanism of action why are you antagonizing the system when we're giving you know a Vasa pressent Agonist if you will and you know some people had said well maybe by blocking the Vasa presson recept you know there's a way to have oxytocin me be more bioavailable that sounds like some gymnastics yeah yeah I totally great and so I've never had a I I've never received a compelling response from anybody about why they did their trial and then you know the differences I mean when when this was ongoing and you know there was potentially room for both right um you know maybe I thought that maybe there's some some optimal band of Vasa presson signaling in the the brain right and so maybe there's some people where they have too much vasopress and some who have too little right and so this was a lot of maybe but it it doesn't to me seem like that's the case especially if our current trial has a positive rate out I'd be remiss if I didn't ask for your stance and uh read of the landscape "

            "text": "on the data about vacines and autism I'm not talking about covid vaccines here I want to be really clear about that but there was a theory uh running about um not just in the Press but in um the scientific literature for a while that uh vaccines could cause autism yeah that was proposed um my understanding is that was debunked that idea still lives on the internet um but what is the evidence or let let's say let's go through this sequentially what was the idea what was the evidence for that idea and then what caused the demise of the the at least the scientific support for that idea leaving open of course that new data may come right but let's talk about what is known now right and I think what I will say is being evidence-based is is sort of like something that all scientists should strive for right and so so the the backstory on this is there was a guy named Andrew Wakefield who published a paper um and he basically said the preservatives and vaccines are causing autism so not the specific vaccine but the adant the stuff that's preserving the stuff that's keeping the the vaccines um bio effective right at least that was my understanding right that's mine as well and so and and then it turn I want to be clear because the internet is is a is a cruel and um diabolical place my stance is that that was the hypothesis I don't agree with that stance right okay right and so or if we want to just back up a little bit broader there was this idea that something about vaccines were causing a um autism but the study was debunked he lost his medical license and the paper was retracted right well he lost his medical license on the basis of the fact that the study was wrong or was there think he F the data there were that's why I recall as well that there was evidence of him literally making up the data right right so it wasn't a case of like sloppy technique it was a case of of intentional fraud right that's my understanding again what was the did anyone ever like look into what his motivation for what what it was like why someone would I mean threw away his whole career right yeah I don't I don't know um but but I think the hard part about that is understandably people got very frightened right that we're doing something to our children that could have you know un unanticipated consequences and you know when something like that happens then we dump a you know we we spend a lot of money investigating it and so the the the good news is at this point there have been multiple multiple studies that haven't shown a correlation between you know vaccines and autism I do believe the preservatives have been changed as a result so that's something we should check um that you know that might be something where you know there's been a public health change on preservatives that are in vaccines that's interesting in its own right I mean we don't want to cause alarm if um but that's that's interesting you know that that in this data fraud case it might have cued people to the idea that certain things might have been um needing change even though it wasn't the specific issue that this uh this fraudulent researcher was focused on the change was made to make sure people would vaccinate their children right like so this is something that I think we should have lots of caveats here like you know post the post the studies like make sure that what we're saying is accurate right but I but I think that my concern is that we've spent you know so the good news is that you know the Maj like every single study that I'm aware of does not not show a relationship between vaccination and autism right and so I think that most scientists and medical doctors that I know that are part of like the you know standard biomed research Community do not believe the vaccines cause autism they vaccinate their own children you know they recommend vaccinations to other people's children um and and so I think that's where we are um you know could I just ask a question um uh and I feel more than obligated to do this because I I don't you know I think I have a pretty good finger on the pulse of the listenership of this podcast but I think there's a range of of stances on this um where some people um have a lot of trust in the standard medical establishment others have less right trust in the standard medical establishment and I wouldn't be doing my job if I didn't try and represent um all those sides um and you know one thing that I've heard okay is that over the last 20 or 30 years there's been a dramatic increase in the number of vaccinations that kids get and I don't know if that's true but when we say vaccinations we could be talking about you know measles Mom's forella right um polio um we could also be talking about measles bumps forbell polio flu shots every year rabies vaccine technis vaccine H HPV right with one that wasn't even available when I was in in college you know as a everyone in college was was well aware there wasn't an HPV vaccine um didn't change people's behavior a whole lot but um you know there's there's a vaccine there's multiple vaccines and then there's you know all the vaccines yeah right and I think that one of the concerns that I hear about um is the idea that okay there's some critical vaccines but then which ones are perhaps less critical if any um and these are the kinds of discussions that are starting to surface um and that you know have parents and potential parents you know rightfully thinking about this stuff and and no one really knows where to get the information but like I'm I I've tried and I can't find a pediatrician that says Hey listen these but not those or you can certainly find board certified Physicians that say many and certain board certified Physicians that say none you actually can find those um the none category tend to hide themselves a little bit more than others for obvious reasons but it's hard to get a sense of like which which vaccines are critical and which ones aren't if you're a parent and you're not versed in this stuff and so you could imagine that like people are you know kids are taking many more vaccines and only some of those are critical or maybe all of them are critical well I think I guess the way I would maybe turn it on its head is that you know because of this this study that did in some ways so much harm right like we SPI study we spent I I I don't even want to Hazard a guess about how much money worldwide went into studying you know the the you know vaccine and autism based on a fraudulent data right like that's to me a real tragedy but at the time they didn't know it was fraudulent exactly so they went after this thinking it was true okay but I think I think the thing the consequence of all this that I think is also extremely sad is that everybody because everyone got so riled up and so fearful there has been historically until recently many researchers who were like oh man I don't want to touch IM mology and autism with a 10-ft pole right and yeah you know and I I wouldn't consider myself Fearless but like my lab never had any reason to work on those yeah on those important problems but I'll tell you like it seems like a it's not a kettle of fish it's it's a ball of barbed wire with a bunch of you know Napalm burning around it and you know I mean you say one thing your your career is ending you say the opposite thing your career is also ending you know it's it it's it's a it's a mess but but I think this highlights that there are so many parents you know again and I think we need to listen to parent stakeholders right like you know there's there needs to be a dialogue whenever anybody's studying any illness to to talk to the people who are involved right and and I think that there are parents who will report wow like there are there is immune system disregulation in my child and but because of this historical issue with vaccines it's only been very recently that I think people scientists medical doctors have said okay we're hearing a lot about this from parents and are there a group of individuals who have you know um immune issues that could be driving their autism right we don't know and everything should be evidence-based but I think that like you said with this cancel culture and all this fear scientists sometimes will pick topics very judiciously based on you know like hey I just want to be left in peace and I'm trying to help this community and if there is areas of the Enterprise that you think are going to cause all kinds of grief then people are going to be less reluctant to study them even if it's critically needed well that's a a perfect place to say thank you I realize you're not addressing the vaccine autism issue directly but you're so clearly going after the target trying to figure out what are the biological mechanisms that are disrupted in autism and by extension other deficits of social function in kids and adults you've identified this incredible relationship between vasopress which should have more prominence in my opinion than oxytocin its lesser cousin just kidding oxytocin lovers um but also have shown you know yes in a small study but you're now extending this to a larger cohort as you mentioned uh a causal relationship when B oppress is administered to these low vasopress SL low social functioning kids their symptoms improve so I I know I speak for many people when I say that um I truly appreciate your doggedness in in going after this problem especially on the complicated landscape of lack of funding for doing novel and truly high-risk work um especially on the backdrop of the sociopolitical landscape around autism it's a complicated thing even to discuss you know as I mentioned in the introduction you know we had to have some fluency around autism so we sometimes said autistic sometimes we said people with Autism you know I mean it's a it's a tough one but in order to make progress real progress in this area we need people like you we need you and you're doing it to get in there and just go okay you know let's get at the biological functions let's get at the novel treatments and you're making amazing progress so I'm so grateful that you're doing it and that you'll continue to do it and that you came here today um to teach us what you've been up to um I'm oh so grateful and I just want to say thank you for that and that we absolutely have to get you back here uh to give us an update on your progress really soon and and again and again and again thank you so much I love being here all right well I've Loved this conversation and um I'll sign off by saying folks this is how diseases are cured thank you for joining me
