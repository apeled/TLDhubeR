yes you are becauseyou have this incredible skill set fromyour time in the FBI you but you alsohave an incredible understanding andknowledge of how to communicate aboutthat skill set so that people can gleanuseful information from ityou are also the guy that I text or callevery once in a while and I've runmyself into a jam or when I think Imight be in a jam and I won't revealdetails but you tell me whether or notthings are okay unfortunately the lastcouple times I reached out you saidyou're good so thank you always happy tohelp man thank you well I have a lot ofquestions today butwhat I'd like to start off talking aboutisnegotiations take many formsbut if we could break those down intotheir broad categories that will beusefulbut before we do thatI want to know about the mindset thatyou have when you go into a negotiationand whether or not there are any sort ofpractices I realize you've been in thisprofession a long time and so it perhapsbecame reflexive to you at some pointbut all of us at some point are going togo into negotiations businessnegotiations relationship negotiationsEtc is there a process of getting one'smind and body right for a negotiationshifting from more listening and lesstalking or what are there any tools thatyou use on the regular that could beuseful for us to keep in mind as weextend into the different categories ofnegotiations and ways to approach thosenegotiations and it can there can be acouple differentumfirst of all just trying to figure outwhat what's really going on is is thereal issue and then how can I get anapproach where I'm most likely to getthe best possible outcomeum so there's always more than meets theeyeand there's a certain there's a certainfew cliches but the real issue isthere's always a better deal orum there's no deal at allso first of all trying to my first thingis I want to find out whether or notthere's a deal at all or whether or notit's a bad dealand then I'm going to walk away reallyfast because those are going to becomplete waste of timeum it's not a sin to not get the deallet's just send to take a long time tonot get the dealwhat's the sin to take a long time toget a bad dealso I you know I want to know I'm goingto try to figure out real quick whetheror not is there Cutthroat on the otherside of the table is it somebody I couldtrustI'm getting I'm leaning a little moreinclined to dealing with the difficultpeople now as long as I don't give inso I gotta I want to diagnose early onwhat the possibilities arenow if I'm curious if I'm actuallyinterestednow another aspect of the mindset isif I'm in a great moodlike if I'm just gonna be playfula couple of reallyhuge personal negotiation wins recentlywas when I was just trying to be playfulI mean I was just I was in a great moodand I'm joking around and greatnegotiation is not exciting it'sastonishingum I'm gonna come we're in conversationsright now with a possible non-scriptedTV showand so I was telling the producersyou know this ain't going to be realhousewivesum for to make this show properly thereain't gonna be any screamingit's not going to be Bar Rescue wherewe're yelling at people we're not goingto be Hell's Kitchen where we're yellingat peopleit's never going to be exciting but itis going to be astonishingyou'll get outcomes where suddenly youfind yourself in a place like what inthe worldhow did that just happenand so I I lose a suitcase in an airportthe other dayand I'm walking into the lost luggageplace and I'm in a great mood becauseI'm home and I'm happy to be homeand I'm going to get a good night'ssleep and even though it's late in theday I'm just happyand are you ready to walk into this thelost luggage store where these peopleare better childrenlike they expect youthey know that you expect them to wave amagic wand and proof your luggage isgoing to be thereso for whatever reason that's what I saywhen I walk in the doors young lady sayshow can I help you well first of all howyou could help me is obvious because I'min a lost luggage there's only onereason I'm in here so that's kind of asilly questionand I go I need you to wave a magic wandand she just laughs and she looks at meshe ends up walking me out to theCarousel climbing up on the Carousel andshe walks down a ramp the luggage comesout of and I guarantee you they're notsupposed to do that and she sticks herhead and she looks around she comes backout and I've never seen any of thesepeople leave the office let alone walkback to the carousel and she says waithere and she she disappears into thebowels of the airport which like lookslike a super highway down there rightlike God knows what it looks likeunderneath the airportand pretty soon the carousel starts upagainand my bag and another bag pops out thisother Porsche Mark is sitting therewaiting and I'm like I have never seenanybody do this everlike normally they say here's a numberwe'll call you in 24 hours it might showup at your houseand I look around at the uh there'sanother young lady there and I sayyou know please tell her thank you forme I gotta go because she she doesn'tcome back out for like almost 10 minutesand on my way out she she comes out thedoor and she high fives me and she sayshow does that for waving a magic wandand that was the magic phrase and Inever would have said it to her if Iwasn't playful in a momentand I've got a couple of others likewhen I was just playful and I'm jokingwith peoplealmost at my expense it's shockingastonishingwhere you can get people to do if you ifyou hit them the right wayso interesting I wonder what it tappedinto but it sounds like it might havetapped into her sense that everybody'salways asking me for a magic wand kindof ability but finally somebody justsaid it directly and that would be kindof fun to to actually play that rolebecause normally they're restricted totheir keyboard and their phone yeah youknow I love thaton the opposite side of that Spectrum if"

the breakups negotiationsthere's not necessarily romanticbreakups that could include that butalso professional breakups you know thethe dissolution of a of a contract orsomething like thatdo you ever have to check yourself likeokay I need to I mean I imagine beingcalm is better than not being calm formost of most all thingsum uh do you have a process of doingthat you seem like a pretty steady guyI've never seen you uh[Laughter]overall I'm pretty steadyum wellthe late night FM DJ voice thatum I'm not sure that I coined the phrasebut kind of famous forto calm you down also calms me downso if I get bent out of shapeum I will in a conversation gets heatedI'll switch into that voice with theintention of calming you down becauseyou know that's the that's the hostagenegotiator's voicebut it'll calm me down too likeintentionally going to that voicetamps down the negative emotions whichI'm convinced make me Dumber in themoment interfere with my capacity toprocess information got reasons for thatLayman's reasons no scientificacademically rigorous studies that havebeen in any journals well after you'redone I'm going to tell you somethingthat will perhaps be astonishing to youas to why there's real Neurosciencebehind that late night FM DJ voicehaving an impact on other people'sbrainsbut yeah and I'll do that because itcalms me downnow if I can if I can make this shiftthe hard part is to shift into apositive mindsetif I can make that shiftbut I can only make it from a calm voiceI also think it's the emotions are kindof a rock paper scissors sequenceI don't think you can go from sadness toElation directlysad um depressed downI think there's something toum getting angry to pull you out ofsadnessand I think if you're angry you've gotto go to calm nextand so but if I can get out of anger andgo to calm then I can say something tomyself likethe reality is this is a luxury problemor I was in a negotiation with acounterpart that I knew was deceivinglying to meand I remember saying to myself you knowI'm lucky to be in this negotiation Imean they wouldn't they wouldn't betrying to hustle meif we weren't really good if we didn'thave a product that was phenomenal Iwouldn't be targeted at allso I'm actually lucky to be in thisconversation so if I can make that nextshift emotionally then I'm good the hardpart is making those chefsI'm going to share with you what Ilearned recently about sound and emotionum I'm researching an episode on musicin the brainfascinating topic believe it or notthere's a lot known andthe auditory system has this propertywhere of course there are neurons nervecells that respond to differentfrequencies of sound low low frequencyyou know deeper tones and high frequencysqueals and that sort of thing rightokaythat's pretty straightforward just likewe have neurons that respond todifferent different colors or differentuh you know angles of light in in theroom right but what I learned and Iconfirmed with a good friend of minewho's an auditory neuroscientist and andneurosurgeons named zetty Chang who wasa guest on this podcast previously isthat low frequency soundsof the sort that your voice isthat late night fmdj voiceare responded to in the brain by neuronsno surprise there but the frequency thatthose neurons fireis also low frequency in other wordswhen you speak in yourlow voice rightthe other person's brain hears that andstarts firing in a low frequency toneright in other words it entrains to yourvoice not just the timing but it'sactually like you're essentially playingan emotional piano down in the low keysof their all right of their mind nowwhen you go up to the high frequenciesthe neurons can't follow that highfrequency so there's something specialabout low frequency sound that actuallychanges the emotional tone of the peoplethat hear that low frequency soundthis is wild right I mean I mean ofcourse the content of the words matterstoobut anyway there's there's realNeuroscience to supportum the voice that you were endowed withand that you uh that you employed foryour work well then and then also thepoint then too is it's not the otherside's not making a choice it's aninvoluntary reaction that's right thisis not something one can override exceptby perhaps plugging their ears rightright if they're hearing that theirtheir mind is getting shifted toward astate of low frequency oscillation whichis one of more calm yeah so that yeah sothat's a real thing and and were you tohave a high squeaky Chipmunks voiceyou might not have been The Negotiatoryou had all that who knows maybe there'dbe another tactic there I mean I I thinkback to the um uh what I guess it wasduring one of the Gulf War campaignswhere they weren't they trying to umsqueeze out uh Saddam and some of uh hispeople by playing like Milli Vanilli athigh volume for hours and hours is thattactic actually usedum so that was that was uh Panama whenthey were trying to get Noriega okay I'monly a few I'm only a few countriesthough see you know I had one ocean or Igot the trivia you know I was tellingyou before and the wacky yeahfascinating useless information aroundterrorism and stuff like that I triedthat at Panamaand and for whatever the military guysthey were playing music at and soundsand thenalso among the many stupid things thatthe FBI did at Wacothen late at night they tried that inthe Waco compound too and it was justthat was one of the things that thehostage negotiators were adamantlyagainst adamantly againstbut they got overruledum by answering command among the manystupid things that were done at Wacothat was also done at Waco it was stupidit's counterproductive hostagenegotiators were always against it sofor those who don't remember Waco Wacois um Branch Davidians uh David koreshright yeah there was a

hostages awayand we'll talk about that stuff umbreakups business deals that have gonewrongum people lying cheating what aboutnegotiations that are benevolent let'ssay that two people want toum come to a true win-win around youknow what they each see to be their bestinterests in let's say friendship twofriends taking a trip together vacationwho's gonna pay for what who's gonna payup front are people going to pay eachother backum or a romantic relationship two peopleare considering you know fusing financesto some extent or moving in togetherwhat sorts of questions should people beasking themselves prior to thosenegotiations in particular is it veryimportant that people know exactly whatthey want going into a negotiation or Ican recall many times when I've goneinto life circumstances knowing I wanteda certain set of feelings or outcomesbut not being extremely specific aboutyou know I want this salary I want tolive in you know in a west facing houseon this particular location you know anexplorationum of potentials I think can also takethe form of negotiation sohow do how should people think aboutapproaching benevolent negotiations likewhere we're not talking about somethingtragic happening if it doesn't gothrough it might hurt it might be alittle bit High friction butlet's talk about how to get to a win-winyeah well there's a couple interestingthings there first of all you know thephrase win-win becausewin-win is just great collaboration Imean an important fact it should bewin-win which might only be emotionalwin-win now the phraseology win-win Iknow that if someone's opens anegotiation with me and they say rightoff the bat look I want to do a win-windeal with youthat correlates extremely highlywith someone who's trying to pick mypocketso I if you use that phrase in the firstfive minutesI already know where you're coming fromyou're trying to get me to draw myguards you when I loseso and this came up on our Instagrampost I put up recentlywhich is essentially watch out for theperson says win-winnow I didn't say win-win is bad I saidwatch out for the person that says italsoyou got to be cautious if if you're likesome of the win-win mindsetthen people set themselves up to justget slaughteredby the person who's expressing a desirefor win-win and looking to pick theirpocket like if I feel win-win in myheart you go let's do a win-win dealif I don't watch it I'm like okay whatdo you want and then I find myselfgiving away the store so there's a lotbehind the win-win phraseologythat you have to have a completeunderstanding of and point of fact bothsides should feel good about the outcomeand isn't that the definition of win-winwell kind of sort ofbut it's how they feel about it morethan really what they gotso in a benevolent negotiation amongfriends where are we gonna go to eat uhwhere are we going on vacation whatroute are we going to takepeople really just want to be heard outmore than anything else whichoperationally seems to be I don'tunderstand how it's going to make anydifferencemakes all the difference in the worldand how what's the best way for somebodyto feel heard out well I'm going tostart out by telling you describing toyou not telling youbut describing to youwhat my best guess is on yourperspectivebecause it's really calibrating meactually finding out where your positionisand the only way I can find out whereyour position actually isI'm gonna I'm gonna increase you tellingme if I start taking a guess at it firstbecause you're immediately right awayyou you immediately going to tell meeither I'm right or I'm wrong you'regoing to correct me correctionis um is a satisfying thing to doand you're going to be much more candidwith me if you're correcting me than ifI'm asking youso I'll and you'll feel good aboutcorrecting me so it's gonna there's allthese great emotional lubricants to megetting you to correct me so I'm goingto start out by saying like here'shere's what I think you're thinkinghere's how I think you're approachingthis is what I think you're wanting outof this out of thisnot what you should bebut what you probably are based on yourperspective and that's going toaccelerate the conversationexponentially like it's ridiculous howmuch faster things are going to go andthen it becomes both an informationgathering and a report building processsimultaneously instead of separatelywhich is what makes this approach fastereven though it seems more indirectso if we're getting ready to let's sayyou're not going to take a car trip toCalif to San Francisco from hereand I'm gonna say all right so my guessisyou want to take the most direct routebecause you hate wasting timeand you're probably going to say to meno no no I want to go up the PacificCoast Highway because this beautifulstretch of uh country like I realizeit's going to be a waste of time if wego up the Pacific coast because we gotto jump off it at some point but Ireally want to see the sceneryyou would have I've taken a guess ofwhat you want and you're going to comeback real quick and correct me and thenmaybeI'm thinking time on the trip but I'veforgotten how beautiful it is to roll upthe coastand so when you throw that out I'll belike oh yeahit is a beautiful ride and we might notget another shot like who knows what'sgoing to happen soyeah I know now now that we're having aconversation I'd rather run up thePacific Coast Highway before we beforewe go Inland and make the trip andthat's how we get toum we collaborate for a bit a betteroutcome maybe a better idea than what Ihad in mind in the first placeI love that because what you justdescribed is hypothesis testing yes it'sthe way scientists are training you knowmany people don't know this but theyteach us in science not to ask questionsbut to start with a question like youknowhow does how does the brain develop orsomething and then you say a hypothesisand you test hypotheses and you figureout if they're right or wrong and thattakes you through a set of decisiontrees and you eventually get it what youhope is some core truthum and then hopefully others arrivethere as well and you get a consensus soI love the idea of hypothesis testing infact when you said uh take the mostdirect route from where we are now inLos Angeles to San Francisco I like totake one-on-one not the five the five isfaster so I immediately think but I like101. first of all there are a couplereally great taco and hamburger spotsalong the way that I used to stop withmy bulldog and yeah also you get to seethe coast and it makes those extra twohours completely worth it and so you'reexactly right in um in thatworking through the decision treedoesn't necessarily meanum presuming that the the hypothesis isright it sounds like you'd be equallyokay with the hypothesis being wrongbecause really what you're trying to dois just learn and in learning set upthis collaboration I love that a coupleof things first of all when you talkabout hypothesis and when when my sonBrandon was involved in a company he'son he's out on his own now but he usedto always say hypothesis test yourhypothesis you always use that termand then even now like we were talkingabout it and you just said you knew somehot dog and hamburger places I'd be likeholy cowI didn't even know that yeah yeah I wantto check those places out so that's howyou discover new stuff in a conversationI love it so um and also I'm sure peopleare noting to not say the words win-winWhen approaching any kind of negotiationwhat do you think it is about thoselittle um catchphrases that that signallack of authenticity or trustworthinessbecause you could imagine that somebodyyou know I come to you and say you knowhey Chris like let's um I don't knowlet's do some collaborative thing forsocial media for podcast and um this isgonna be a win-win for both of us now Iknow to never say that with you but youcould imagine that somebody really meansthat yeah but for you it sounds likeit's a flag that um they're trying topull one over it's it's uh it correlatesreally strongly with the people that aredefinitely trying to cut your throat andI've had I've had him admit that to mecandidly amazing like I'll beum I've experienced it like if somebodythrows win-win out early to me I'll sayall right I think I know where this isgoing but let me explore itand they'll say yeah you know this greatopportunity for you that's another tileand we're going to put you in a roomwith all these billionaires and there'sgoing to be all this opportunity for youif you just come in and speak and youknow we don't have a budget well I'vegotten that one before yeah the famousthe famous uh the world will just workout in your favor because magic becauseit's going to work out in my favor

be willing to share thatwith us well umI learned you know they tried to teachthis early on that not everything'sgoing to work outand the second negotiation I had in thePhilippines uh the first one uh uh ayoung man named Jeff Schilling wasgrabbed by terrorist group uh Abu sayefand he ended up walking away because westill we stole the bad guys long enoughthat we just you know sometimesif you can

wreckand lots of people got killed all alongthe way and just really ridiculous badthings happening and that that was badall the way throughum so we learned you know learned a lotfrom itum went back and checked everything wedidand we didn't do anything wrong that wefelt based on our strategy didn't didn'tmiss anything and that was why I endedup going uh collaborating with the guysat Harvard because my reaction was ifthis if we did everything we know how todo and it wasn't enough that means we'renot smart enough we got to get betterand so that case taught me a lot aboutthe Dynamics that really happened on theother side andthe difference betweenyou know whether or not people arereally on your side the US governmentwas not highly collaborativeuh the Philippine government was nothighly collaborativethat everybody wanted to get their poundof flesh out of the other out of theother side I mean just everything badthat you can imagine early on whenGrandma sabero uh was murdered by theAbu sayif it was a national holiday inthe Philippinesand the bad guys had a history ofkilling people on national holidaysand we weren't from the Philippines andwe had no idea that that day was anational holidayand we showed up at uh Philippinenational police headquarters in Manilaand it was closed now we got it on I gotan ongoing hostage case with bad guysthreatening to kill hostagesand we show up at the gates and thegates are closed and we're like what thehell's going on here it was the nationalholiday nobody's working todayI'm likefirst of all nobody told us thatsecondly I don't think the bad guysreally care that it's a national holidayand nobody's workingour negotiators nowhere to be foundwe got a we got a guy there that um uhthe previous negotiator we worked withPhilippine national police was not thathappy that they didn't havehim under complete control so they giveus a guy that will not tell us anythinguntil after he's told them so he'shaving conversations with the bad guysand we're actually hearing about himsecond handhe didn't show up that day and then andof course that daythe bad guys announced they're going tokill uh kill a hostageand give it as a gift to the country ofthe Philippines because it's a holidayand then go oh by the way they likedoing this on holidaysand soand and Grandma Sombrero ended upgetting his head cut offwith the because of all the warringfactions on our side of the table nottelling each other what the hell's goingonso I had assumed at that point in timethat people would tell us the stuff weneed to know we didn't need to ask andand after that I got like look thereain't nothing here that I don't need toknow I don't if it's a holiday it'scoming up then you assume I know you gotto tell usso really learned a lot aboutcollaboration on our side of the tableand alsothe lack of collaboration on the otherside of the table just because we're amess doesn't mean they got their acttogether and the bad guys didn't havetheir act together and ultimately thehostagesone of the reasons someone didn't comeout because internally they they haddouble crossed each otherso learned a lot about what reallyfundamental human nature Dynamics are onteams and your team has not got its acttogether and the other team does noteither so what can you do as acommunicator to make up for that reallylearned a lot about that in that case Ihad cases subsequent to that involvingAl Qaeda when Al Qaeda was killingpeople on a regular basisbut we saw those coming and we dideverything we could do to keep the trainfrom smashing into US you see a traincoming down the tracksyou know it's coming down the tracksand you do the best you can to derail itand sometimes you can'tI've heard it said that"

other side is gambling right they'regambling their their freedom they'regambling theirum reputation with whoever theirreputation matters toum is it important to get into themindset of the person you're negotiatingwith quicklyum using the hypothesis uh generatingmethodum and if so uh could you give anexample of how that played out in inyour previous work yeah the um uh theindicators are really there I mean onceyou sort of uh lose your Illusions abouthow you things how you think thingsshould play outthen the patterns of behavior aregenerally pretty quickuh and clear and just because you don'tlike the patterns like with Al Qaeda werecognize the patterns andknowing what they are doesn't mean youcan change what they are and Al Qaeda in2004's time frame was very clear aboutkilling people on deadlineand we had to recognize thatso there there becomes a pattern ofbehavior and it's usually specificity inwhat they sayand this is this is all this is allhuman nature like ifif you're in a business negotiation andthey say you know we're gonna dosomething horrible here you know we'regonna walk outyou know that's fairly non-specificand if they say look if we don't getthis by this specific deadline if wedon't get these specific things met bythis specific timethat's pretty specific that it'sspecificity you're looking for itI learned to look forward in kidnappingnegotiations we're working a case againin the Philippinesand a bad guy say you know if uh if wedon't get a ransom for the sun 17 yearold boy at the time is kidnapped youknow you tell his father he's going tolose an eggand that's you've you've euphemism forlosing a childand early on when that threat camethrough on our side of the tableeverybody's like oh my God they're goingto kill him you know this is really badwe got to make sure the family can paythe ransom I'm like no no noit didn't it didn't say when it wasgoing to happen they didn't say how it'sgoing to happenthey didn't say who was going to do ityou know the basic specificity of whowhat when and where like they leftthemselves and out here a very clear outand we never said we were going to do itwe never said when it was going tohappen we never said which child youknow what they're just trying to scareyou they're throwing out something backI said we got we got plenty of time toplay with thiswe gotta we gotta push this all the waythrough the process into the endnow later on in that casewhen the family tried to deliver aransom and it was screwed up by Godknows whothe bad guys came up back on the phoneand they said if we don't get paidtomorrow your son diesand I said all right now that's specificand these guys sound like they mean itand so we're going to have to make surethis thing goes down tomorroworthat's the end of this kitand at that point in time we allowed thefamilywe were in a position to allow ordisallowwe were in a position to offer thoughtsand our thoughts werethey mean it now and you need to dosomethingnow or likely something bad is going tohappen andnow that they're this serious becauseyou always got to worry about what weused to refer to as a double dipdo they take the money and then and theycome back and say no that was a downpayment that wasn't the ransom that wasjust a down paymentyou got to make sure you don't getdouble dipped if you let the family payand you got to give me your honestopinion as to whether or not they'regoing to let the hostage go if you paynowand our our thoughts were you Pamtomorrow your son's coming out and hedidthe double dip is a scary thing to hearaboutum at a much lower level meaning moreminor levelum people sometimes get shaken downonline you know like their password willget taken there are people everywherewho go for the click on this link youknow you get a text message you knowwe've identified that your account hasyou know been changed verify you clickon the link takes you someplace whereyou put in your login and password andboom it's gone and then they try andsell it back to you typically throughcryptocurrency because it's nottraceable by the way those thosenegotiations can be a lot of fun if youlet themwell I'm hoping that our discussionabout this now is going to save somepeople uh the trouble of having theirtheir accounts hacked I've known peoplewho've had their accounts hacked andthese are some smart people but what'sinteresting is that I've also observedthose situations where somebody gets tothe point where they say you know I'mjust going to give them what they wantand I I remember in this one particularinstance saying no no do not give themthe money because then they're justgoing to say they want more there's nothere's no guarantee that they're goingto give you back what you want right andwhy would they right if you think aboutit why would they the money funnels inand like they just can pivot and go tothe next thing so how do youum gain confidence that you are likelyto be double dipped or notum well first of all I got to find outif you know if they're in a position tocarry out the threat or if they're inany sort of legitimate position to beginwith you know for lack of a better termit's Proof of Lifeand there are a lot of people that aretrying to scam you but they don't reallyhave the ability to scam youso you got to find out you know do someconfirmation do they do they have accessto your account do they do they haveyour data they have your money do theyhave it in a position are they justtrying to make you believethat they have that position ofinfluence on youum there are a lot of a lot of the badguys out there that are just rolling adie styling for dollars if you willand if they don't scam you when theyhave no leverage on you they'll findsomebody else that'll give in so there'sa bit of you know authenticity or or arethey in a position to do it and umthe same rule applies in any negotiationum the other side is going to give inwhen they feel like they've gotteneverything they cankidnappers I'd be asked by an ambassadorasked by an FBI Commander when's it isgoing to be over when the bad guys feellike they've gotten everything theycould not when they didbut when they felt like they didso our job is just make them feel itsoonerso you know how how hard you make itinnocentlyon the other side everybody everybodywants to feel like they did a they got agood day's pay for a good day's worksoif you let them feel like they're inchargeand you make them workby asking them innocent how and whatquestionswhich are very hard and fatiguing toanswerthen you're going to get to the pointwhere you're going to get a solidoutcome where you don't get doubledipped and they're going to be happythat it's over because they felt likethey got everything they could it couldbe your data could be your bank accountum could be anythingthe other side is going to be satisfiedwith the outcome when they feel likethey worked for itand in business negotiations you'reselling your carand some you put a price tag on your carand a guy walks up to you and says I'llgive you full amount right nowwhat's your reactionI should ask for moreum maybe I won't sell my caryou know every human interaction theother side wants to feel like that theyearned what they gotand so the idea ofempathy and hostage negotiations isreally just to make them feel thatsoonerwe're going to come back to empathy"

um is that a good rule of thumbfor people to keep in mind to to not Ithink that's a great rule of thumb Imean I I A friend of mine um somebodygot a hold of his phone number not thatlong ago and um I was getting texts fromhis numberso I'm like look man I got some realproblems look I need some money from younow who's a friend a friend's numberand I remember when I first saw itactually if when I first saw it I wasreally busy and I felt bad that I didn'tget back to him that dayand then I didn't hear from him againand so I thought well whatever it wasyou worked it outso a couple weeks later I get the textagainyou've got a real problem you got to getback to me right nowso I'm I'm I decide if it's really mybuddy I am gonna help him right now Igotta make sure it's really my buddyand I said hey man you know uh youdidn't raise this at all last time I sawyou in Vegas because I'd seen him inVegas recentlyand he's like yeah you know I was busy Icouldn't bring it upand something like ours so there's nodirect confirmation or denial we had wehad breakfast together in Vegasso then I shoot back I said like and manI got to tell you something that wassuch a crazy night and I still owe youmoney from them soyou know that night when we weregambling I I still owe you money I'mhappy to helpnow it wasn't a crazy night it wasbreakfast and I didn't know moneyand his next response was like yeahdon't worry about it you know you canmake that up from from to me with thisso I'm like all right coolso now I start making stuff upand I said you know and when we werewith those strippers and that dog andthe clown and the pony I'll never getover that and so now the guys what areyou talking about and I said by the wayand then I started throwing in somestuff about his wife and his mother andthe guy got insulted and called me namesand stopped texting me and then I then Isent all those text messages to the realguyincluding you know what I'd said abouthis motherand he texted me back he's got a greatsense of humor he says by the way my momdoes think you're attractiveoh man I think but I start I started itall by just checking the sourceif it was my friend I would have helpedhim immediatelyand I need to throw something at himthat's going to confirm that it's himand then I'm there for himbut I'm also going to have put a littlebit of a curve in there that that if hedoesn't catch I know it's I know it's aconand then I'm gonna have fun with itincredible knowledge that you knowpeople will hear this and they mightthink oh you know that's never going tohappen to me but like I said I've knownfamily members and friends who they makethe mistake they take the bait ofclicking on the link and then nowthey're getting the Shakedownum actually a good friend of minesaid that her parentscalled at some point her parentsprobably in their late 70s nowum someone had called their house andtold them that their child this womanhad beenumkidnapped right and that they needed tosend money right and that if they calledthe police they'd kill her or harm herin some way right so they startedsending money and they were afraid tocontact her and you can see like what abind a a loving parent would be in rightthey obviously don't want to get thischild of theirs hurt and they obviouslyare willing to do whatever it takes inorder to get them back turns out it wastotal scam right because eventuallythere was communication that made merealize that their daughter wasperfectly okay and never even interactedwith kidnappers so those kinds of scamshappen pretty often I've had that happento a friend also yeah so the sense ofurgency should have been the first flagthat's a that's a great Point yeahabsolutely yeah and look look even ifthey've got your loved onethe secondary issue is if you do whatthey want are they going to let them gowhich is actually a legitimate questionlike if they really are bad guys one ofthe things we learned inhostage negotiation that I applied abusiness negotiationthere are legitimate questions that it'sokay to askyou're not being disrespectful you'renot pushing backthere's there are fairyou know to use the F-bomb Fairlegitimate questions that you can askunder any circumstances which isbasically you know if I complyis this going to work out the way thatyou're articulating itanything that adds communication into itwhich gives you more informationto find out what the ultimate outcomelooks likeeven in kidnappingshow do you know that how do you knowthat if you pay they're going to letthem gothat's a legitimate questionthere are examples somewhere in betweenyou know getting your Instagram accounthacked your bank account hacked and youGod forbid your child kidnappedfor instance there's a wholepractice within the legal profession ofprobing to see whether or

situationsbut you know it made me realize that youknow a lot of the legal profession isnot okay the lawsuit slid across thetable it's the okay here's what thelawsuit would look like here are all thestatutes that potentially were wereviolated and then there's a probe oflike what somebody's finances are andyou know how much they're willing to payand do they have liability insurance dothey have an umbrella policy all thesorts of things that are that are reallyit's not necessarily an illegalShakedown but it'syou know a probing as to whether or notyou know there's it's worth the effortdiagnosing the other side's ability topay you're right and so that happensreally often I can give a specificexample whereum somebody had a incident at a dog parkwhere their dogumallegedly ran into somebody maybecharged at somebody you know dog parkpeople are standing around and theperson moved and and apparently injuredtheir kneebut rather thansue the owner of the dog what theytypically do is deliver some set ofdocuments that say you knowI was injured your dog was responsiblefor thisum andif you don't settle up for X number ofdollars you're going to be sued forusually an exorbitant amount above thatright right and then there's thisquestion that the the lawyers have tofigure out like is it puffery right arethey saying I'm going to sue you forfour million dollars is there any basisfor that and good lawyers will saythat's puffery they're they're trying toscare you with a big number but a lot ofpeople see that number and go oh mygoodness what do they want you know whatlike I don't even know if they wereinjured if they were that's terrible I'dwant that taken care of if my dog'sresponsible I'd want that taken care ofbut what what do they need in order tomake this this go away right and thathappens millions of times a daythroughout the country and a goodportion of those probably happen here inCalifornia because there's a that's kindof the way the legal system is arrangedright so this is not somebodyum you know it could be somebodymanipulating the law it could also besomebody who's being entirely honestabout their experience of being injuredby somebody else's dogso under those conditions I mean itsounds like the same set of rules applyyou want to know how serious they aredo they have a case so to speak that'sthe work of the lawyers but in assessinghow serious somebody is you saidyou it's fair you called it the f word Ilike that I'll never forget that it justask a fair question like like how muchmoney do you think you deserve orum is that would that be a good exampleof a very direct question uh or is itum How likely are you to walk away if wedon't give you the money like you knowis there I mean because I can imaginethere's all sorts of reasons why peoplewould be dishonest about about answeringthose questions well and then uh howmuch money do you think you coulddeserve uh you deserve is is a reallygood question not necessarilywhat the answer is but how they answerityou're going to get how quickly theyfire back and whether or not they stopand think about ithow and what questions typicallyare best to judge these other side'sreaction and the answer is secondarybecause the how or what question causeswhat we would refer to as deep thinkingslow thinking Danny Kahnemanbehavioral economicsthinking fast and slow slow thinking isin-depth thinkingyou ask a how or what question to makethe other side think firstand judge their reaction to how theythink about itand do they actually do they actuallythink about it or do they fire rightback at you that gives you a clearerpicture of who you're dealing with wherethe outcome is going to go how muchmoney do you think that you deserve ifthey immediately you know 10 milliondollarsall right so this is I got a Shakedownartist on the other sideor they say all right if they stop andthink about it and they give you athoughtful answer that's a completelydifferent person on the other sideyou're

most competitive journalsto publish in science nature and celland I only mentioned that because therewas a series of Articles written inScience magazine about Magneto receptionin humans you know the idea that humanscan detect magnetic fields sounds likequackery right Turtles can detectmagnetic fields they migrate by themactually long distances but the idea isthat humans can't do that and yet thereare some well-controlled studies wherepeople have to guess about theorientation of a magnetic field and theydo it better than chance not everyonecan do it but some can do it better thanchance in a way that cannot be predictedby anything else except some inherentform of magnetoreception in theirnervous system so there are capabilitiesof the nervous system that are startingto be revealed for which we don't have alot of evidence but there's enoughevidence to suggest that these thingsare really happeningum the other example which you mightfind interesting is a little bit uh morea little less esoteric but there's abeautiful paper published in one of thecell press journals a couple of yearsago showing that when people listen tothe same storythe distance between their Heartbeatstends to be very similar now it doesn'tmean that their exact heart rates aresimilar but if you look at the distancebetween their heartbeats they allentrained to the same Rhythm the samesong and get this they're in completelyseparate rooms these experiments arebeing done on completely separate daysand yet if I were to line up just youknow the distance between the theheartbeats for you they would line uplike a set of columns wow for dozens ofindividuals listening to the same storyso you know clearly there's a passage ofenergy from things we hear and things wesee that goes into our nervous system ata level that's below our consciousdetection here's the last thing I'll sayabout this we have a series on MentalHealth coming out not Mental Illness butmental healthum by the uh I think to be among thevery finest psychiatrists in the worldDr Paul Conte and he said you know weall think that the forebrain is thesuper computer right he said nothe subconscious is the super yeah yeahthat's where the real knowledgeprocessing is happening that's theiceberg below the surface where all thereal heavy lifting has taken place andthat people who learn to tap into thesubconsciouscan learn to use that information invery meaningful ways and I think that'swhat you're describing he's been on withyou before right he has to talk abouttrauma in particular and he was on LexFriedman's podcast as well the seriesthat we're doing with him is not abouttrauma per se it's really about thesubconscious and the self I think you'llfind this series really interesting yeahand it has a number of very practicalquestions that one can ask themselvesabout their subconscious and and kind ofwork the process of Psychiatry we'reexcited to release that series but it umbecause I don't know of anything like itthat's been put out there into thepublic but but I was so umpleasantly surprised to hear him say youknow we all hear that the the forebrainis the super computer it's what droveour Evolution he's like no no noit's the it's the subconscious that'swhere our real wisdom resides and theforebrain is just the implementationdevice so it's uh you know uh how we canconvince ourselves that that we're incharge right yeah I mean I can't thinkof a time that my gut told me a and itturned out to be B more often than notthough I've suppressed my response rightI override it thinking I think I madethe mistake that you guys train yournegotiators to avoid which is I thoughtwell this is making me anxious and theanxiety must be like me like this mustbe my fault or I'm not able to callmyself in this situationum not sleeping well Etc and um andtherefore like this much must representsome deficiency on my part and then umand Lord knows as your shirt points outI'm I'm a very flawed person I have manyflaws I always say I have 3 000 petpeeves and at least as many flaws tomatch those that piece I wonder when atleast relationship but umthe point being that I think our bodiesreally do know they know yeah yeah yeahyeah I would agree so when you're doingnegotiations and you're hearing"

in the literature around dopamineand motivation and it's a term frompsychology that is being used a littlebit more nowum and it's ego depletion yeah it's aninteresting concept and I've beenwanting to run this by you for a whilebut I saved it for our discussion todayit turns out ego depletion is a lot likedecision fatigueum you know we've all heard the SteveJobs thing you know he wore a blackturtleneck every day because it you knowhe didn't have to make that decision sohe had more energy to make otherdecisions I've been accused of doing thesame because of my black long sleeveshirts but there's a whole other reasonfor that that um some people might knowbut anyway it's unimportantin the momentum but ego depletion is a little bitdifferent than decision fatigue ordecision budget the idea with egodepletion is pretty simple it's that themolecule dopamine does many things inthe brain but one of the things that itabsolutely does is it holds us to goaldirected Behavior that's associated witha sense of self like I want toaccomplish this I want to get to thatand the whole notion of ego depletioninvolves the the idea and this has beena data substantiated observation thatwhen people have to fight to be rightor to defend their positionfor a period of time eventually thatdepletes and it seems to be at least inpart dopamine mediated becausedefending one's position takes workright you earlier you talked aboutrunning somebody down you knowum wearing them out and I wonder as Ijust throw this concept out to you acold here whether or not that calls tomind any examples from your work whereyou felt like okay like this personcould really holdbut if I just kept pressing eventuallythey tilt right you know and it'sdifferent than the kind of fatigue thatcomes from a conversation that starts atthree in the afternoon and ends at 2 30in the morning we've all been thereright I've been in those conversationsusually they're not very pleasant and atthree in the morning everyone's peelingapart you just I've learned over theyears you know like you clip it at 9 30and you try and shift right right youknow one of the worst pieces of adviceI've ever heardum is you'd never go to sleep angry it'slike no actually uh actually get sleepwake up and then revisit the problem ifthe situation allows that's my uh that'smy uh yeahum trying to stay up all night trying towork something out it's just counterbiology so ego depletionum I have a feeling a lot of what youdid in your profession wasum running down their dopamine to thepoint where then they are operating froma different place where they're notdefending the ego they're actuallythinking more practically about thewhole situation does it have any kind oftexture of meaning to you yeah no Iwould I would agree and I would draw thedistinctionuh first of all in hostage negotiationthere's there's two kind of Hostagetakingsum if there's a demandum and it's going to be contained anduncontained which is just literaldefinition contained as bad guys in abank like at the Chase Bank in Brooklynway back when you got them surroundedthey can't get awayand uncontained as a kidnapping youdon't know where they are uncontainedunknown locationwe're going to try to get our way in acontained situationprobably by ego depletion wearing themout get them to the point where theyjust I just they're just going to givein because they're tiredbecause they're going to come out we'regoing to put handcuffs on themumwhich meansthat if the ego gets rechargedthey're going to go back in there thinkthey're going to think back over thedealso wearing somebody out in a businessnegotiation it's basically uncontainedbecause even if you come to an agreementthere's a whole implementation phasethey're going to you did you did you getthe agreement because you warm upbecause they get tiredbecause he just gave in at some point intime they're going to get recharged andthey're going to get recharged whileyou're in implementationso they're either going to not going tofollow the terms of the dealor it's the slightest opportunitythey're going to deviateand so yeah I think Eagle depletion isis a real thing and it's a bad wayto get a business deal that's going tostickbecause they rest and then they comeback yeah a different person yeah yeahthey're going to be recharged their egois going to berecharged and if you get the if you gotthe agreement based on a depletion ofthe ego that battery is going to getcharged back up again whether it's abusiness deal whether it's a personalnegotiationyou know you have a disagreement withyour significant other and you youfollow that bad advice don't go to bedangryand so you stay up till three in themorning and you think you come to aresolution everybody gets a good night'ssleep the next day they feel completelydifferently about what they said thenight before yeah I might have heard ofthat happening once or twice it's not ina movie right yeah I saw it in a movielike a friend

ventyou've been talking and people beenignoring youor you've been taking actions and peoplehave been ignoring you it's a it's youneed to vent because your communicationreactions have been ignored there aresome Clues here and the sooner that Iget at the heart of what's bothering youthe sooner you're going to be able tolet it off so I'm going to encourageletting the steam offwithout trying to correct you withoutgiving you adviceum without frustrating you by notlistening to you by trying to recognizeverbally what some of the motivators arewhich will deactivate the anger muchmore quickly it's the whole basis for acrisis hotline to begin withpeople are ventingand so how do you most effectively ventsomebody so that instead of going on arant for an hourand the rantintroduce toxins into their system wherethey're poisoning themselves I thinknegative emotions put toxins in oursystemyou know how do I deactivate that asquickly so that you're not hurtingyourself as much and and you you feelheard you feel relieved you feellistened toso I'm gonna and if it involves me ifit's a close friend who's venting to youyou're involved in a situation to somedegreeand I might even say boy it feels likeyou're probably frustrated because Ihaven't listened to you up to now youknow I'm going to talk start taking someemotionally educated guesses on what Ithink is driving you and I'm gonna putin the form of a label which is just anobservation seems like sounds like lookslikethen if I get it wrong and you go that'snot it at all I can say well that's justthe way it seemsit just seems that wayit puts you in a position to to just letsomebody know you see them and you'redoing your best to understandI'm I'm not a fan of venting I if if Igo on a rantpersonally I always feel worseso I want to deactivate that negativityso I can get get my feedback under meemotionallyvery useful knowledge you just sharedwith usdo you meditatetiny little bits I mean and trying tomake my day more effective

not you believe inone God or the universe or whatever itis I think spiritual spirituality is animportant component of Health whateveryour spirituality is you shouldrecognize it and you shouldyou'll be better offif you engage in some sort of aspiritual practice doesn't have to beany of the three major religions youknow but spirituality is a component ofwho we are so yeah I practice it on aregular basis so a sense of higher powerorum to better Define higher power itcould be as you said with aligned withconventional religion or just alignedwith the idea that there are thingsoutside of us that are important to payattention to that we can all do betterby being in recognition of or service toor or both yeah something like yeahpretty much pretty much like that andand then leaving it as open and as aspossiblebecause there I think there's aspiritual nature to us periodI agreewhat about your physical training I I"

negotiationsthat were very long and fatiguing soum do you recall one of the longernegotiations that you had and how do yousleep at night Midway through a hostagecrisisumso the longest one that I was I wasdirectly involved in on almost day today and hour to hour one when it wentabout three-ish daysWashington D.C2003 start of the second Iraq war guynamed Dwight Watson rolled the tractorinto the middle of DC and claimed he hadfour bombs and he left four bombsscattered aroundthe cityhad he actually done that or he was justcall he was bluffing he was bluffing hehadn't done eitherumand started on St Patrick's Daykind of interesting a couple you knowlike that like the thing in um uh yousaid in was in of the Philippines it'slike national holiday yeah holiday rightinteresting uh for a whole bunch ofreasons now I and and I had to go homeand go to sleepuh when one night and when we're in themiddle of that and then it was justI don't remember having trouble going tosleep because I felt like I did a goodjobum and that we handed I handed the shiftoff to another hostage negotiator forthe bureau was effectively the teamleader of Vince stefanzo and Vince wasbringing a negotiatorso and the team that he was with I youknow everybody was in good handsas a matter of fact Vince almost kickedme out of the scene because I didn'twant to go and he just kept saying gohome get some sleep go home get somesleep and finally the fifth time he saidit to me I went homeso I felt like I was leaving uh thingsin really good handsand we're working kidnappings weexpected them to go for long periods oftime and you just you just kind of gottait if you have faith in the processand you feel like that you're doing thebest it can be done then I think youcould sleep at nightumI guess to answer that questionyou you have to be careful whetheryou're working a a case of Siege orum anything in in the bureau that youdon't run yourself into the groundand there was some cases I worked in the90s where I mean like we we knockedourselves outlike we would we worked harder anybodywe ever saw but we occasionally we tooktime off too you know I worked with guysthat realized that sometimes you got togo out and have a beardkick back and blow off some some steamso I think everybody that I ever workedwith were occasionally cautious enoughto recharge the batteries and thendepending upon the nature of thechallenge in front of you it was a Siegein Saint Martin's Parish and went sixdays I don't think those guys got a lotof sleep but the nature of those siegesin that particular type of sea generallylasts five or six days anyway you justgotta gut it outwere there ever instances where you'rejust trying to keep the person on theline so they can just raidyou know I I know I never had to do thatpersonally you had to be prepared to dothatfrom the very beginning of any Siegethat you might have to get some youmight have to orchestrate an assault ofsome sort I was fortunate enough earlyon in my training there's kind of afamous Siege in if you know hostagenegotiation history in Londoncalled a princess gate Siegewhere um a legendary British hostagenegotiated David Van Ness had the badguys on the phone while the SAS washidden hitting the buildingand I remember that we were shown likelook there may come a timewhen you have to keep somebody on thephone when SWAT comes in that goes withthe territoryso expect that's a possibility from thevery beginning and it was a great Siegeum the bad guy Saleem the photos of himafter he was shot the phone is withinhis reach David kept him on the phoneI've heard the tapesthe breaching explosions were going onandum slim says I gotta go I gotta gothere's suspicious noises and David VanNess in his classic British accent saidSalimthere are no suspicious noisesnow let's get back to talking about howmany people are going on the bus to theairportbam and and they went in and and Icaught up with David a number of yearslater I had a FBI pres I had apresidential intern from the White Houseinternal with me in the bureauwe're drinking in a bar with David VanNess I got a lot of stories where I'mdrinking at a bar with somebodyand the intern walked around everybodyand tapped David on the shoulder and hesays uh Chris says you kept theTerrorist on the phone up to the momentthat the SAS came in the doorand David says yeah and I already kepthim on the phone even longer if the SAShad hadn't come in so soonsowhy am I telling that story if you'regoing to get into that line of businessyou got to accept all the things that gowith it and

I I knew one of thenegotiators that was 15. so I was bornin 75 soum and as I recall they ended up openingfire on a bunch of hostages who werelaying down on the ground is that rightthey um they they knew that they weregetting ready to execute the hostagesbecause they put bags over their headsand that whenever the bad guys doanything to dehumanize a hostageit's easier to shoot somebody with a bagover their head than it is notbecause you can't see their faceand so the bad guys had begun thatprocess and they knew they needed toassaultGod forbid anyone should ever be takenhostageI realize circumstances differ but youjust mentionedputting bags over their heads there'sthis notion of sheeple that you knowpeople will describeumpost-hoc after something about how youknow somebody walks into a buildingtells people to you know put zip ties ontheir own ankles or go into a back roomthat nobody resists and that inretrospect had somebody caused acommotionthey might have caused enough of acommotion to either run out or be let goum and yet of course there's a verylogical part of everybody's brain Iwould hope that thinks listen thisperson is an aggressor there's a gun inmy face don't be an idiot right becausewe also have heard of the case in NewYork City that I read about this in thenewspaper so presumably it's true wheresomeone was held up at gunpoint and oneof the women in the group that was heldup said what are you gonna do shoot usand the person shot them right so thathappens too so you knowum I don't know if there's a a fair andsafe answer to give people on this butif you're told to do something bysomebody and it's all happening in realtime I mean you have to ask do they wantmy money in my body my life or somecombination of the three right in realtime while under presumably significantduressum but for hostages like if they if theydisobey cause a commotion is thatextending their life or is it shorteningtheir life I guess it it's very contextdependent rightum the only thing that I could withoutknowing the context anything you coulddo to humanize yourself and comply withwhat the bad guys want increases yourchance of survivalso let's say you got ordered to go in aback room you could look at the hostagetaker and say I'll do whatever you sayI'm Chrisyou know drop your name on them in a wayso that you go from being a facelessperson to somebody with a name thatincreases the chances of your survivalhumanization whatever you can do tocomply simultaneously become more of ahuman being because it's the opposite ofwhat I was talking about beforeif you're easier to kill if you've beendehumanized you're harder to kill ifyou've been humanized you're harder toharm like maybe they're not going tokill you they're just gonna they're justgonna hurt you they're less likely toharm you if they know your first namehow do you get them as a hostagenegotiator if they if they talk about ahostage I'll say you you know you meanyou mean Sheilado you mean Rexyou know I'll find a way to drop theperson's name into the conversation soas soon as if if you can humanize justbygetting them to know your name youincrease the chances of survivabilityyou increase the chances of beingtreated better and and comply I'll dowhatever well I'll do whatever you sayI'm Chrisis gonna is gonna start to move the oddsin your favoryou know that what you just describedextends to uh scienceum you know I've talked before about mystance on animal research and um why Ichoose to no longer do itum I do think it has its place in makingimportant discoveries that cannot bemade on humans but that eventuallyextend to oh you don't want to do it Idon't want to do it personally I don'twant to do it and I don't want to doprimate work or large carnivore work orsmall carnivore work but um the point Iwas going to make is that when you doprimate workumthey strongly discouragenear forbid you from giving them namesright they give them numbers right rightright right right so it all falls inline with what you were what you weretalking about because the momentsomething has a name it moves from beinga research animal to a pet of sorts andthat makes it a relationship right sointeresting how a name turns somethingfrom a you know it elevates something toa relationship however insignificant itit's up a notchan entire empathy circuitry yeah yeahyeah which is uh

of for their ownmeanings soummy take on empathy tactical empathyalso to keep drawing names out becausepeople give me thoughts and I want toSource them out I'm very close toStephen Cutler's perspective on it andStephen would say empathy is about thetransmission of information compassionis the reaction to the transmission Ilike that and by the way I'm a fan ofSteven's work I think he I think he'squite astute and a boy is he a hardworker he writes like a beast I thinkhe's up at like four in the morning healso has like 50 Chihuahuas or somethingcrazy he's weighing the dogs yeah yeahwell you can fit more Chihuahuas in aroom than any others gotcha Stevenbut yeah so um and and that was when Iwas with the FBI we startedcollaborating with Harvard because theHarvard definitionum was empathy was not liking the othersideit was just demonstrating anunderstanding of their perspectiveum Bob manukin's book beyond winningschapter the tension between empathy andassertiveness he says empathy is notagreeing disagreeing or even liking theother sidewhich sort of falls into what Stephentalked about you know it's about thetransmission of information now empathyis very compassionate thing to dobut it doesn't necessarily equate tocompassion itself if I'm if I do if Ilet you know if I make you feel heard byme saying to you what your perspectiveon something isyou're going to feel cared for you'regoing to feel understood it's going toland with you really wellI don't necessarily have to feelcompassion for you I know it's aprecursor to compassion so I wouldseparate it from sympathy clearlyand I would even separate it fromcompassion although I know it's a verycompassionate thing to do it's abouttactical empathy is about me activelydemonstrating verballyto you that I understand where you'recoming fromtactic from The Experience on hostagenegotiatorsbacked up by Neuroscienceis that people largely react negativelyso the smarter move for me instead oftrying to reinforce a positive is toFirst deactivate the negative by simplycalling it out calling the elephant aroom outdon't deny the elephant don't ignore theelephant call The Elephant a room outsayit probably going to sound like I'mgreedyif I expect that you're going to thinkI'm overreaching I'm not going to say Idon't want you to think I'm greedy I'mgoing to say it's probably going to seemgreedyso simplywell-educated emotional intelligenceinfluence gut instinct influence on whatthe other side is thinking and feelingif I can Define it in that way then itbecomes an unlimited skill if itrequires me for to have compassion foryou when I don'tthen that limits my ability to useempathy and I'm not interested in havingthat ability to be limited I want it tobe an unlimited skillso if you just if you just Define itstrictly in terms of transmission ofinformationthen it's not sympathy or Compassion orliking or green it has a very powerfuleffect it at least feels like compassionto the other sideit reacts with the emotional circuitrythe neurochemicals that everybody has tosome degree if they're alive even ifthey're on this the spectrum they havesome of that going on insideand of what I've read on even even amental illnessesuh in my last century training I sawpeople who were paranoid schizophrenicis it effectively be more of a wiringproblem than a chemical problemfor for Layman's descriptionand a lot of what I've read saidempathy's even effective with paranoidschizophrenics people regardless of howuhdisarray the circuitry in their head isit's uh it helps themon some level to feel understoodso empathy is just about lettingsomebody feel understoodexample when I'm working terrorism wehad a lot ofArab Muslims testify an open civiliancourt against a legitimateMuslim cleric who was also a criminalwho also committed crimesandI would sit down with them and I'd sayto him right off the bat because I knowwhere they're coming from you believethat there's been a succession

articulating what theirperspective on the interaction was theywere so startled by itwas empathyand andwe were so good at that empathyfrequently in that in that time framethey would say are you are you Muslimand I'd say no I respect the religionyou know if you need to know you knowI'm a Christianbut I respect your religion and I I gotno problem saying to you where you'recoming from that's

does that work ahigh IQ guy is going to want to knowsomething that's really simple thatdoesn't take any effort to doand that's what a mirror does it'sreally really effective it's almost noeffort on your part at allinteresting I must say that Neurosciencehas a um an unfortunate dearth ofknowledge about how brains interact thisis starting to change but most of whatwe know about how brains work is fromputting people into functional magneticresonance imaging machine so-called MRIexposing them to movies or games thatthey have to play Etc and then lookingat brain state activation there are afew Laboratories starting to look at howpeople interact in real time with bothpeople in separate MRI machines thathopefully will be able to parse some ofthis and I'm certain that somebodyhearing this will use this knowledge togo do the experiment if not I'll I'llrun out the flagpole to some uh highlyqualified people at Stanford who couldwho could do this because it'd be fun tosee what's happening but I have thesense that what's happening is thatthere is a real merge of cognition whenone hears their own words right spokenback to them thatum well it's you know you've now got twobrains processing the same informationand that has to lead new places soum I don't have any um insight as towhere what exactly is happening but umcertainly that something is happeningthere right right evidenced by the realworld results that you're getting wedon't need experiments to tell us thatum but it'd be interesting to to see andlearn a bit of what's happening ifthere's a fusion for instance of aco-activation of emotional centersco-activation of there's something abouthearing our own voiceis very different than hearing otherpeople's voices most people cringe whenthey hear their own voice on recordingrightum most not allum some people are in love with theirown voiceum we know these peoplebut we know that our auditory systemcancels outthe hearing of our own voice did youknow that as we're talking now ourauditory system is suppressing our ownvoice we don't really hear ourselvesspeak the same way that when you speak Ihear you speak yeah so um it's an activeneurochemical inhibition of the responseand it's amazing too because as we growup our voice changes puberty and soforth and other ways too that the vocalcords change in thickness Etc and ourvoice changes but we always know selffrom other in terms of voice and wecancel out our actual auditoryperception of our own that's fascinatingand breathing and heartbeat we shut downour response to self actively within thebrain that's fascinating so maybehearing back some of what we just saidallows us to actually hear what we justsaid yeah well true and that's whypeople sometimes all somebody needs is asounding boardso they can

about and read about in otherplaces that if people were undergoing anegative emotionin my Layman's paraphrase of theexperiment is they've shown a picturethat induced the negative emotion intheir head

by simply by calling it outis just darn near all the timeso for largely 75 percent negative andwe can deactivate the negativityby calling it out well let's beproactive if you're a human being andwe're engaged in a negotiationthere's going to be certain verypredictable negativity that's going tobe thereand I should be proactive in calling itoutanticipating the negativity is going tobe therebased on a circumstances highlypredictableand your gut instinct before you'rereferring to when you want to say look Idon't want you to think I'm being greedyyour gut's telling you it's highlypredictable you're going to come off asgreedyso let me be proactive and say it'sprobably going to seem like I'm beinggreedyand that's the dialing over to what iseminently predictable in the interactionand just being proactive to deactivatethe negative emotionsthat either are taking place or what ourexperiences found then I haven't seenanyscience that is yet that has had theopportunityto back this up it inoculatesI can create a barrier if I call out anegative that's not there it doesn'tplant itit actually inoculates you from it ifand I've done this in practice I've Iwas given a lecture a couple of yearsagoanybody asked a question I try to findthe value in the question no matter howbad the question isthis poor guy asked me a question that Ijust cannot find a single component inhis questionthat demonstrates that he was listeningor paying attention there was nothingabout it that I could congratulate himonand so I saidthis is going to sound harshbecause I know the answer I'm gettingready to give him is going to make itsound like to the group that I thinkhe's stupidI just I can't think of a way to respondto this without saying effectively likewhat are you thinking about that's gotnothing to do what we're talking aboutso I go this is going to sound harshand I answer the question and he justkind of goes okay and I start answeringsomebody else question and he goesthat wasn't harshnow if I hadn't said this is going tosound harshand answered the questionI guarantee you my answer would haveembarrassed themand embarrassment is one of the worstnegative emotions you can inflict onanybody and he would hate me to this dayfor embarrassing himso I got a moment coming at me that ispredictably negativeand I can let it I can let that trainrun me downor I can call that out in advance andget a reaction where the guy saysit wasn't that badand that's what being proactive aboutthe emotions is aboutI love it and I'm recalling an instanceduring graduate school where my graduateadvisor who sadly has passed away butwas a phenomenal scientist I mean justso pureinsisted on getting the answers couldemotionally detach from the answers andshe's just was it was a ninja she usedto come into the laboratory when we wereworking on a paper and she'd sit downand she'd sayYou're Gonna Hate Me for what I'm aboutto ask you to do and I think oh no likeI'm gonna have to redo all the analysisor I'm gonna like some you knowMonumental thing and then she'd sayyou gotta change the like fonts infigure twolike oh my Godly what do you mean I wantto hate you but but it was relief but Iwanted nothing more than to make herhappy with my work because I I respectedthe standard that she held so so greatlyum I mean she could have asked me to youknow stand on my head and do theexperiments 50 times I would probablywould have done it if I thought theywould make the project better and as aconsequence she would have been pleasedum because she was the standard for mein many ways still is but I'm wonderingif she read your book because uh she'sdepressed theseum requests with like you're gonna hateme and then she'd ask me for somethinglike oh I hate you like that's nothingbut now I wonder if if I would have beentaken aback if she had just said uh youknow um hey by the way figure two needsredoing I might have been kind ofbristled by that so um maybe she readyour book Christhese are great tools mirroring andproactive listening and thank you forsharing these of coursedid you ever employ the family members"

read it if they haven't alreadybut you're doing a lot more right nowthanum than just writing although I want tohear about your other book projects aswell but before you list off the numberof things you're doing tell me firstabout Fireside because this sounds likea really interestingum Endeavor that frankly I haven't heardof before what's Fireside a brand newsocial media platform it's essentiallyan interactive podcast it's asubscription service founded by Fallonfatimi and Mark Cuban follow and I havebeen friends for a number of years shewas Google's youngest employee she's anentrepreneur Dynamic smart hard chargingpersonand it'ssort of grew out of what's inadequate insome of the social media apps that areout theretrying to combine the best ideas of afew different things and found suggestedit to me and I thought I'll jump inbecause she's a visionaryand what has turned out to be is it'seffectively weekly Interactive Groupcoachingand you you get the app off your iPhoneor your Android whatever platform yourphone is onand then you log in we do an hour once aweek and it's you're getting groupcoaching and then you get askedquestionsand it's got a video component to it soif you want to ask a question we we'regoing to bring you up on quote stage andI get to see you and talk directly toyou and you get to see me and talkdirectly to me or and I interviewed MarkCuban a couple of weeks ago and peoplegot to come on and ask Mark questionsor ask me questionsand what it has turned out to be is justone of sort of uh uh the the next levelof how to get better at negotiationsafter you've read the book and probablytaken to Master Classyou know where do you go next one of thepeople that came on the podcast theother day the the Firesideepisode they said well I don't haveenough money yet to go to your in-persontraining events because those areexpensiveand this is how I'm going to get betterin the in a meantime and and work my wayin that directionand sothe monthly coaching if you were to signup for group coaching from us on aregular basis on a monthly basisit would probably easily cost you forwhat we're providing twenty five thirtythousand dollars a monthand this is a thousand a yearso at scaleit's an opportunity to interact directlywith me and the members on my team oncea week and get group coaching and it'sand it's just kind of fun we're gettinga kick out of it and people that reallyreally care about interacting well withpeopleguy comes on the first episode I did andhe saidbesides the fact that you helped me makea lot more money you helped me save mymarriageand he just needed to know how to talkmore genuinely and honestlywith his wife in a way that made herfelt heardand he didn't really have a good way todo that beforehandand I was just likethat's a lot I don't I don't I don'tknow how to respond to that other thanjust be grateful thatpeople can say stuff like that to us sothe Fireside thing is kind of cool we'restill experimenting with itit's an interactive podcast groupcoachingit's fungreat I mean I would say uh you'rechanging lives there I mean the saving amarriage is no small deal and I thinkthat the ability to communicateum directly with people also I imaginegives them the opportunity to implementthe the tools that you're providing inreal time and that's one thing to hearabout something and and try it but thenuh you can give feedback in real timeare you on these these Fireside Chatsdirectly or members of your team no I Ido we do one every week and I'm once amonth and the other thing too like I canexplain something one way and if forwhatever reason it doesn't land in yourcontext you can't quite get itso that's what we found about theinteractive nature of it somebody comeson and asks a question in their contextand then I'll answer it and then they'llgo like oh oh oh oh okay all right thathelped so you get you get to hear peoplelike you who are struggling with it theway you are but I haven'tput it in your context yet and that'sthe other thing that's great about a q alive q awe had a guest on here who told me thatthere are amazing data supporting thefact that people follow the medical andhealth advice of doctors that they canrelate to far more than they follow themedical and health advice of thePhysicians that they feel aren't likethemumand oftentimes this can include thephysician or health care provider beingsomeone that they would aspire to belike but oftentimes it's just somecommon Rapport like they both likebaseball or they both like to cook or togarden and that sets a bridge rightwhere then the patient is willing to doall these things that ordinarily theywould be resistant to right and andthere are really good data to supportthis and I I that that really stuck withme because it says that it's it's notjust about the information or the thedelivery route or the information thatthe context and the rapports even alongsomething is like oh you you're uh bythe way I'm not a major you know a majorsports fan on most things but you knowlike oh you're a Bills fan or somethinglike me too like that can be thedifference between somebody doing allthe things to lower their blood pressureor the day in changing their diet allthe all those thingsversus not making the changes at allRapport is the magic yeah it's kind of amagic component that
