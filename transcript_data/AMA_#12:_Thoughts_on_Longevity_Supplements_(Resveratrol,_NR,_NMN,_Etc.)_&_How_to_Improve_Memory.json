            "text": "The question\nspecifically is, and Iquote, \"there seems to be a lot\nof conjecture about resveratroland whether or not it\ncan extend lifespan.Could you please tell us your\nthoughts on this subject?\"OK, well, I will indeed tell\nyou my thoughts on this subject.And I'll use it\nas an opportunityto also give you my thoughts\nabout supplementationfor sake of longevity, that\nis, for extending lifespan,more generally.So resveratrol got\na lot of attentionsome years back\nbecause, at the time,it was believed that\nsupplementing with resveratrolcould impact certain cellular\npathways that would extend notjust the lifespan of\nthose individual cellsbut perhaps the lifespan of the\nentire organism, meaning us,humans.And as a consequence,\nsupplementssuch as resveratrol supplements\nbut also grape seed extracts,which we know contain a\nfair amount of resveratrolor can be converted\ninto resveratrol, alsoreceived a lot of attention\nfor their potentialto increase lifespan.I think by now, 2023,\nit's fair to saythat most of that thinking has\nbeen, let's just say, debunked.I think that most\npeople understandthat while indeed\nresveratrol mighthave some positive effects on\nthe functioning of our cellsthat there is very\nlittle, if any,direct evidence that resveratrol\ncan increase lifespan.If you are aware of any data\nto the contrary that is modern,is highly controlled,\nand even better,was carried out in human\nstudies or non-human primatestudies or even\nmouse studies, pleaseput links to those in\nthe comments on YouTube,because I'd love to see\nthose studies, especiallyrecent studies.But my current\nline of thinking isthat resveratrol while it may\nhave certain health benefitsdoes not seem to\nincrease lifespan.Now, with that\nsaid, that doesn'tmean that things like\nresveratrol or grape seedextract are of zero utility.In fact, I take 400 to 800\nmilligrams of grape seedextract, usually with a meal.It's just part of my\nstandard supplementationstack every single day.But I do that mainly for its\neffects on vascular functionand blood flow and\na few other effectsthat grape seed extract\nhas been related to.The data there, I would say,\nare reasonably strong, strongenough certainly\nthat when weighedagainst the potential downsides\nof taking grape seed extract,including the cost of\ngrape seed extract,lead me to take 400\nto 800 milligramsgrape seed extract per day.I just do that as a kind\nof general insurance policyagainst a number of things.And it's part of a\nsmall kit of supplementsthat I take that fall\ninto that category,meaning supplements that appear\nto be very safe, certainlyat the dosages that\nI just referred to,supplements that\npotentially are havingpositive effects on\nour cells, and that arefairly if not very low cost.So that's why I take\ngrape seed extract.I do not take it for\nits potential impacton resveratrol and\nresveratrol-related pathwaysper se and certainly not\nto extend my lifespan.So that basically answers the\nquestion that I was asked,which is what are your\nthoughts on resveratrolfor extending lifespan.My answer was I don't\nthink it extends lifespan.But I take something related\nto resveratrol for other healthpurposes.And by the way, I\ncertainly wouldn'tplace grape seed extract\nin my list of top fiveor even top 10 supplements\nif somebody, for instance,said I want to take anywhere\nfrom one to 10 supplements,and I have x amount of budget\nto devote to supplementation.And I'm thinking about\ntaking grape seed extract.Would that be one of\nthe top 10 supplementsyou would recommend?I certainly wouldn't\nput it in the top 10.And by the way, at some point\nin the not too distant future,I will put online--so I'll probably do a\npodcast episode-- listingout all the supplements that\nI take and the rationalebehind those and how long I've\ntaken them and the effectsthat I've observed both\nsubjectively and in my bloodwork and what I recommend to\nother people, what I don'trecommend to other people,\nwhat's specific to me,and so on and so forth.But meanwhile, that's my\nanswer to the question.I don't think resveratrol\nincreases longevity.At least, I'm not aware\nof any direct evidencefor that in humans.Now, with that said, let's\nuse this as an opportunityto talk about some of the\nother so-called longevitysupplements and drugs that\nare often discussed onlineand elsewhere in terms of their\nefficacy to increase lifespan.About four or five\nyears ago, therewas a sudden and\nincreased attentionon NAD-related pathways\nfor increasing longevity.So the NAD pathway, as some\nof you may already know,is a pathway within\nall of our cells.This is a pathway that is\nhighly active in young animalsand humans.But all animals and humans\nacross the entire lifespanmake NAD in their cells.It's related to\ncellular energetics.That is the production\nof energy in cells.It has direct relevance\nto mitochondrialfunction and mitochondrial\nfunction to it.And that's a\ndiscussion unto itself.But suffice it to say that\nthe pathway leading to NADincludes things\nsuch as NR and NMN.NR and NMN are considered by\nmany to be precursors to NAD.OK, so why am I telling\nyou all these acronyms?Here's the deal.The argument was made, in\nfact, by some prior guestson the Huberman Lab podcast and\nelsewhere that by increasingNAD levels in our cells\nthat one could potentiallyextend lifespan.And there are generally\nthree ways in which peoplehave attempted to do that.OK, we'll talk about whether or\nnot increasing NAD in our cellsactually increases\nlifespan in a moment.But for the time being,\nlet's just talk about someof the ways that people\nhave tried to increase NADwithin their brain and body.The most typical ways\nthat people have done thatis through, until very\nrecently, supplementation.And so there are supplements\nout there such as NR which weknow can increase NAD levels.So this is taken as\na pill or a powder,typically as a\ncapsule or a powder.Or by taking NMN which,\nand here there's been some,let's just say,\ndebate as to whetheror not taking NMN actually\nleads to increasesin NAD within our\ncells, whether or notit can get into our\ncells, whether or notit's converted into NAD,\nand so on and so on.But there again, the idea\nwas by taking NAD eitherin capsule form, or\nit's sometimes takenas a sublingual powder, that\none could increase NAD levelsand thereby potentially\nincrease lifespan.And then there's a third\nway that's commonlyused to try and\nincrease NAD levels,and that's by infusing\nby intravenous infusion,or in some cases, by oral\nadministration, either liquidor pill form, NAD itself.Now, I confess that I have tried\nall three of these approaches.OK, so I do indeed take an\nNR supplement every day.I take 500 milligrams of NR.I also and have separately\ntaken an NMN supplement.I take sublingual NMN.So I'll take anywhere\nfrom 1 to 2 grams of NMNas a sublingual powder,\nwhich as the name suggests,you put it under your tongue,\nand it dissolves there.It's got this kind\nof tangy flavor.And the goal for me in taking\nan NR and NMN each day--and I should mention that\nsometimes I have justtaken NMN or just NR to do the\ncomparison between NR and NMNfor me in a subjective way, just\ncomparing what are my energylevels, how do I\nfeel, whether or notthere are any side effects.And then I've also\ntaken them together.And I've arrived at a\nprotocol where I takeNR and NMN every single day.And the goal of that is\nindeed to increase NAD levelswithin my system.However, and I really\nwant to emphasize this,I do not take NR and NMN in\norder to increase my lifespan.In fact, at this\npoint in history,it's unclear and seems somewhat\nunlikely that increasing NAD isgoing to increase lifespan.But I think we should\nalways keep our minds open.There may be data to\narrive in the future thatshows that actually\ndoes happen in humans.Now, there are some animal data\nsuggesting that increasing NADeither by taking NR and/or\nNMN can increase lifespan.But frankly, that is not\nwhy I take NR and NMN.I take NR and NMN in an\neffort to increase NAD.And now I realize what I'm about\nto say is entirely subjective.And I really want\nto highlight that.What I'm about to\ndescribe is my experience.It is not based on any\npeer-reviewed studies.When I take NR and\nNMN at the dosagesI talked about a\nlittle bit earlier,it gives me a lot of sustained\nmental and physical energythroughout the day.Now, I've always had a lot of\nmental and physical energy.But I'm 48 years old now.And I'm interested\nin doing anythingthat I safely can to keep\nthose levels of energyas high as is reasonable, right?I don't want to\nhave so much energythat I can't sit still\nor so much energythat I can't sleep at night.But I find that when I take\nNR and NMN in the morning--so typically, I'll do\nthis before my first meal.I don't really regulate how\nclose it is to that first meal.So I'll wake up,\nuse the bathroom,hydrate, get my sunlight,\ndo all the things I'vetalked about on other podcasts.But I'll take my\nNR and NMN sometimeusually within\nabout an hour or twoof waking up and typically\nat least 30 minutesto two hours before my first\nmeal, which for me usuallyarrives around 11:00 a.m.So sometimes I'll take it\nlong before my first meal.In any event, it gives\nme a lot of energy.And I seem to have that\nenergy throughout the day.I have gone periods\nof time whereI stopped taking NR and/or NMN.And while I didn't feel\nas if I was completelydepleted of energy, I did\nnotice a decrement in energycompared to when\nI took NR and NMN.Now, I want to be\nvery, very clear.I have no, zero,\nfinancial relationshipto any company that\nmanufactures NR.And while I used to have a\nrelationship to a company thatmade NMN, as of\nrecently, there'san FDA ruling that has made NMN\nnot available as a supplementin the wider world.So earlier this year--\nthat is in 2023--there was a filing for\nNMN as a experimental drugin a clinical trial.And as a consequence, NMN\nwas listed as a banned or notallowed to be commercially\nsold supplement.And that has to do with\nsome of the legalityaround clinical trials.And when something is listed\nas an experimental drug,it can't be listed\nas a supplement.Nonetheless, you can still\nfind NMN on the open market.You can find it on Amazon.I can't really\nspeak to the purityof one source versus another.You'll have to explore\nthat on your own.But I will say this, even\nthough I said it before.I have zero financial\nrelationshipto any company that manufactures\nand sells NMN at this timeor NR at this time.So the short summary to\nthis whole discussionabout NR and NMN is\nthat I take NR and NMN,but I take it because I\nlike how it makes me feel.It increases my energy\nlevels in the morningand throughout the day.And it does so in\na way that tapersoff nicely in the\nevening, and I can stillfall asleep, et cetera.I do not take it\nwith any expectationthat it's going to\nincrease my lifespan,simply because I don't think\nthe data substantiatingthe extension and\nlifespan are here yet.They may arrive at some point.But I don't think that\nthey are here yet.So there are a good\nnumber of people out therethat still take NR and/or NMN\nand are doing so in effortsto increase NAD.And so let's take a moment\nand talk about increasing NADdirectly, because\nthat's somethingthat I have some recent\nexperience with, and that'sbecoming more common and\nis, yes, still FDA approved,at least as far as I know.There are companies that\ncan come to your house,or you can go to a\nfacility, and theywill give you an NAD infusion.So they will infuse you\ndirectly with NAD into the vein.I've done this twice now.And I will say, as\nmost people experiencewhen they do an NAD infusion,\nit's pretty darn uncomfortable.In fact, so much so\nthat a lot of peoplehave to take anti-nausea meds in\norder to get the NAD infusion.I opted to not take\nthe anti-nausea meds,not because I'm\nparticularly tough,but because I don't like taking\nadditional medication if I can.But I've taken anywhere from\n500 to 1,000 milligrams of NADby infusion.I did that at times when\nI was feeling particularlyrundown or post-illness.And I did indeed find that after\nthe NAD infusion was complete,I felt much, much better in\na number of different ways--improved sleep, improved vigor,\ncoming off those illnesses.I felt much better.But again, there is\nno clinical trialexploring NAD infusion\nfor sake of vigor,et cetera, that I am aware of.I just happen to\nbe somebody who isinterested in exploring these\ntools and techniques from timeto time.And I deemed this as safe.Whether or not\nit's safe for you,you have to explore\nwith your physician.Also, I do want to reemphasize\nwhat I said a moment ago.Those NAD infusions are\npretty darn uncomfortable.You can have the\nperson administeringthe infusion adjust the\nrate of the infusionso that the drip\nis slower, whichmakes it more tolerable\nas opposed to tryingto get the whole infusion bag\nin there in 45 minutes or less.I just wanted to get the\nwhole thing over with.So I just said, put it in\nas quickly as you reasonablyand safely can.It took about an hour,\nmaybe 45 minutes to an hour.Initially, I felt nauseous.I felt like someone was\nstepping on my chest.I felt like someone was\nstepping on my legs.I felt like, well,\nI just felt lousy.I felt so awful.And then after about\n10 minutes, it passed.And I felt fine.And then after the infusion was\ndone, as I mentioned before,I felt terrific.I was still able to fall\nasleep that night just fine,although I did make it a point\nto do this earlier in the day.I have heard of some people\ndoing NAD infusions laterin the day and having\nchallenges with sleep.But again, that's\njust anecdotal.Or we could call it anecdata,\nif you want, but it's anecdotal.It's generally assumed\nfor obvious reasonsthat NAD infusions are more\neffective at increasingcellular levels of NAD\nthan NR or NMN or bothtogether, although the direct\ncomparison has not been made,as far as I know.And there's still this\ngeneral question as towhether or not any of this stuff\nis getting into cells directlyand impacting NAD levels\nin specific cells,although I think most\npeople assume that the NADinfusions certainly are.Now, there are a number of\ndifferent experts out therewho debate all the fine points\nof everything that I just said,people like Dr. Charles\nBrenner and peoplelike Dr. David Sinclair,\npeople like Matt Kaeberlein.There are people\nwho really actively,and let's just say, heatedly\ndebate all the issuesthat I just talked about.I think the greatest debate\nis around whether or notincreasing NAD levels in cells\nactually increases lifespan.But there's also a debate\naround whether or notNR is more advantageous than\nNMN, whether or not all of thisis too premature to\nexplore yet already.Again, I just want to\nrestate for the third time.I don't do any of this\nstuff in these NAD pathwaysfor sake of increasing lifespan.I do it for sake of the\nvitality and energy effectsthat I subjectively experience.I must say that the NAD\ninfusions are expensive enough,inconvenient enough, and let's\njust say uncomfortable enoughthat I don't see myself\ndoing them very often,although perhaps maybe doing\nthem a couple of times a yearor more makes sense\nshould I find myselffeeling run down or post-illness\nfatigue or things of that sort.I would be very curious\nto learn from any of you,the audience, what\nsorts of thingsyou've experienced\nif perhaps you'veexplored NR supplementation,\nNMN supplementation, or NADinfusions.And as I mentioned\nearlier, there'snow a growing number\nof different productsthat claim that you\ncan take NAD orally,so either in pill,\ntincture or other forms,so no requirement\nfor an infusion.But I'm not aware of any\nstudies that have directlylinked oral NAD to\nNAD levels in cellsand how those two things relate.So lots more important science\nto be done in this area, lotsmore debate surely to\nbe had, and any time wetalk about supplements,\nI just wantto emphasize several times that\nI do see supplements as indeedsupplements.I think only by getting your\nlight exposure, sunshine,movement, nutrition,\nstress modulation,social relationships, et\ncetera, correct should you evenbegin to consider\nsupplementation,because supplementation\nis just notat the foundation of mental\nhealth, physical health,and performance.It is indeed something\nthat, providedit fits within your safety\nand economic frameworks,could potentially\nenhance mental health,physical health,\nperformance in certain ways.But it's certainly\nnot the foundationfrom which you build mental\nhealth, physical health,and performance.So now we've talked about\nresveratrol, a little bitabout grape seed extract.We've talked about NR and NMN\nand NAD and the NAD pathway.There are a few other\nthings that are commonlydiscussed in the longevity\nsphere, let's callit, things such as metformin.I'll just be very direct and\nsay I do not take metformin.And I also don't\ntake what some peoplecall the poor man's version of\nmetformin, which is berberine.Berberine gives me\nbrutal headaches.Berberine lowers blood glucose.That's why I think it's\ngiving me brutal headaches.A lot of people\nhave explored or arethinking about exploring taking\nmetformin or berberine for sakeof lowering blood glucose and\nlowering a particular cellular,let's just say, pathway or\na set of molecules, mTORbeing the most common of them.mTOR, mammalian\nTarget of Rapamycin,is abundant in developing cells.It's responsible for the\ngrowth of individual cells.And the amount of\nmTOR in our cellstapers off across our lifespan.mTOR and its\npathways is somethingthat I've actually worked\non fairly extensivelyin my laboratory in the\ncontext of the regenerationof the visual system.So I'm very familiar with it.And for sake of convenience\nand ease in this conversation,we can just think\nof mTOR as somethingthat's abundant in\ncells during developmentand any time cells\nare growing, includingthe growth of tumor\ncells, and cellular growthat any stage of the lifespan.So the logic that\npeople have wagedis that drugs like metformin\nor compounds like berberinethat reduce mTOR levels or\nimpact the mTOR pathway in waysthat lead to net\ndecreases in mTOR,the logic is that could\nsomehow increase lifespan.There's also the logic that\nfasting can reduce mTORwhich can increase lifespan.I don't think there's any\ndirect evidence for thatyet, however, at\nleast not in humans.So I'll tell you.I don't take berberine for the\nreasons I mentioned before.It makes me feel uncomfortable.Not psychologically\nuncomfortable,it makes me feel\nphysically uncomfortable.I don't take metformin because\nexpert colleagues of mine,including Dr. Peter Attia,\nhave come on this podcast.In fact, we did a collaboration\njournal club podcastthat we'll provide a\nlink to in the shownote captions during which\nwe, meaning mainly Peter,reviewed the peer-reviewed\ndata on metformin and lifespan.And at least to\nmy understanding,at present, there\nisn't sufficient datato support taking metformin\nfor increasing lifespan.So that's why I don't take it.I may in the future if more\ndata come out and things change.But right now, I see no\nreason to take metforminto increase my lifespan.So I don't take metformin.Similarly, there's\na lot of discussionout there about rapamycin.Remember mTOR, mammalian\nTarget of Rapamycin,is so named because it's a\ntarget of this drug, whichis used largely as\nan anticancer drugbut has other purposes as well.Rapamycin is actively\nunder investigation,which makes it sound like\nthere was a crime committed.But as far as I\nknow, there wasn't.Under active\nscientific explorationwould be the more\naccurate way to say it,by excellent researchers such\nas Dr. Matt Kaeberlein upat the University of\nWashington in Seattle.He's been looking at\nrapamycin for its abilityto extend lifespan, focusing\non many different species,including dogs.So he has a dog\nlongevity project.So that's really interesting.Dr. Peter Attia has talked\na lot about rapamycinand did a recent\npodcast about rapamycinwith not only Matt\nKaeberlein but oneof the experts in\nthe world on mTOR.So I invite you to check\nout that podcast if youwant to learn about rapamycin.So there is a fair\namount of understandingabout the biological pathways\nof rapamycin and mTOR and so on.And there are\nclinician physicians,like Peter as well\nas others, whoare quite excited about\nthe potential for rapamycinto extend lifespan, although\nyou have to go directlyto Peter to find out\nexactly what he's doing,whether or not he's\ntaking rapamycin or not.I certainly can't speak for him.But at present, I\ndon't take rapamycin.Why don't I take rapamycin?Well, I don't take rapamycin\nbecause at least to my eye,the data at present\ndon't justifythat for sake of\nincreasing lifespan.That is not to\nsay that rapamycinisn't an effective drug for the\ntreatment of various cancersand for other purposes.But for me, at\nthis point in time,I just don't see a\ngood reason for meto take rapamycin relative to\nsome of the, let's just say,substantiated potential\nside effects of rapamycin.It is a drug that I\nthink can be taken safelyunder certain conditions but has\nenough of a side effect profilethat I'm not\ninterested in taking itfor sake of increasing\nlifespan at this time.So no metformin, no\nrapamycin for me right now,perhaps in the future.I've listed out\nthe things that I'mperfectly willing and happy\nto do, grape seed extract, NRand NMN, the\noccasional NAD infusionto increase NAD directly,\nand for the time being,I've decided to stay away\nfrom metformin and rapamycin.But of course, any\nand all of thatcould change going\nforward dependingon the data that are published\nand my own experiences.As a final point on this,\nI want to again emphasizethat the foundation of a\nquality life and a long lifeis most certainly going to\ncome from the basics, perhapsthe most fundamental\nand important of whichis to get sufficient amounts\nof quality sleep each night.We know that not\ndoing that can indeedreduce your lifespan if not\ndirectly, then certainlyindirectly by increased\nnumber of accidentsand certainly being far\nless happy and energeticduring the day.So that's fundamental.Also, and this is very\nimportant to emphasize--and here I'm essentially\nborrowing the words straightout of Dr. Peter Attia's mouth.So forgive me, Peter.This won't be nearly\nas eloquent or succinctas Peter would make it.But it is very, very clear\nthat at present thereis no supplement or drug\nfor increasing longevitythat even comes close to the\nknown improvements in healthmetrics that relate to longevity\nthat come from getting qualitysleep and especially from\ngetting sufficient amountsof quality exercise.So that means both a combination\nof cardiovascular exercise,a minimum of 180 to 220 minutes\nof so-called zone 2 cardioper week.So that's cardio that\nyou can carry outwhile still maintaining\na conversationbut should you increase\nthe intensity any more,you would have a hard time\ncompleting your sentences.But in addition to that also\ndoing some VO2 max work,so getting your heart rate way,\nway up at least once per week,and also, of course, doing\nresistance training eitherwith weights, machines\nor bodyweight,doing that at\nsufficient intensity,six sets minimum per\nbody part per weekto maintain not just\nmuscular size and strengthbut equally important,\nperhaps even more important,maintaining nerve to\nmuscle connectivity,which correlates with\ncognitive functionand a number of other\nimportant longevity metrics.So again exercise, sleep,\nquality nutrition, qualitysocial connection,\nwhich means eliminatingas best you can toxic\nsocial connectionand increasing quality social\nconnection, people that youlike and enjoy spending time\nwith and feel enriched by,stress modulation, all of\nthese things are so key.And of course, getting morning\nsunlight, all of those thingscombine to have a huge out-sized\neffect compared to anythingthat you could take in\npill, capsule or infusion.So before even considering\ntaking any supplement or drugto increase your longevity or\neven for increasing vitalityfor that matter, get those\nbasics of sleep, sunlight,nutrition, movement, stress\nmodulation, or stress control,I should say, and\nrelationships down.Get those right.And get that morning sunlight\nto set your circadian rhythm,because of course,\nyour circadian rhythmis what anchors it all.And I'd be completely\nremiss if I didn't emphasizeyet again that any time you're\nthinking of adding a supplementor removing a supplement\nfrom your regimenor adding a prescription drug\nor removing a prescription drug,you absolutely\nshould consult you'reboard-certified physician.Thank you for joining\nfor the beginning"
