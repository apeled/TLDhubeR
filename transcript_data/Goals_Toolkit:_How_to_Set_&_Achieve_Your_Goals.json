            "text": "how lofty that goal is will impactwhether or not you are able to achieveit and I think most people mistakenlybelieve that if a goal is easy toachieve it's more likely that they willachieve that goal sort of a duh but infact the opposite has been shown to betrue if a goal is too easy to achieve itseems that it doesn't recruit sufficientamounts of the arousal Network thatinvolves the amydala but a bunch ofother brain structures as well that getpeople into the necessary actions tocontinually pursue that goal thisperhaps should not be surprising inorder to learn something we have toshift our nervous system into statesthat are somewhat uncomfortable theseshould be safely uncomfortable Statesbut they should be uncomfortable Statesand we're going to talk more about thisas the episode continues but any kind ofsuccessful learning or goal Pursuit isgoing to involve errors it's it's goingto involve failures it's going toinvolve frustration it's going toinvolve anxiety all of those states ofMind and Body in fact shift the braininto modes of so-called neuroplasticitythey give it the ability to change andthat should make perfect sense becauseif you can complete what you need to doeasily there's absolutely no reason forthe neural circuitry in your brain orbody to shift in any way why would itrather those states of discomfortfrustration anxiety Etcrepresent shifts in neurochemical statesthat literally open the opportunity forneuroplasticity to occur the changesbetween neurons that allow those neuronsand their Associated neural circuits toperform differently in the future whenwe learn something so the key here istwofold first Define the specificpriority goal that you're going topursue and set aside all other goalPursuits and in doing that it makessense to pursue a somewhat loftier goalthan perhaps a more mundane goal or ifyou know exactly what goal you're goingto prioritize that you try and Achieveperhaps more than you think you ought tobe able to achieve within that givengoal and within the goal that you decideto prioritize you want to set a level ofprogress a level of performance thatyou're striving to attain that's a bitabove what you actually believe at thistime you can accomplish now in doing soyou are inevitably going to encountersome frustration and anxiety butremember the component of the neuralcircuitry that we talked about at thebeginning of the episode the orbitalfrontal cortex that orbital frontalcortex is not just part of a neuralcircuitry that assesses how we feel in agiven moment as we are trying to pursuea goal but it also understands contextit has the capacity to for instance seethat you are experiencing anxiety knowthat you are frustrated but now that youunderstand that anxiety and frustrationthat comes with making errors isactually the Gateway it's a necessarygateway to achieving neural circuitchanges so-callneuroplasticity well the orbital frontalcortex understands that context itliterally can take information aboutneuroplasticity it can take informationabout frustration which you now have andit can combine those such that when youexperience that frustration youexperience those errors and youpreviously would have wanted to quit nowyou know that you are literally makingprogress you're literally shifting thoseneural circuits in the direction ofimproved learning now it's alsoimportant to remind that neuroplasticitythe changes in neural circuits thatallow for improved performance in thefuture does not occur instantaneouslythat frustration that occurs during ourattempts to learn or to pursue a goal isthe trigger for neuroplasticity theactual rewiring of neural circuits thatallows for proficient correctperformance occurs during deep sleep andother forms of deep rest this issomething I've covered extensively inepisodes on neuroplasticity and learningand if you you'd like to learn moreabout neuroplasticity in fact if you'dlike a zeroc cost toolkit that definesthe so-called super protocol forneuroplasticity and learning that is notjust nested within the context of goalPursuit and learning we have that youcan go to hubman lab.com you go to themenu go scroll down to newsletter andyou can sign up it's completely zerocost and you'll get that as a brief Ibelieve it's a two or maybe three pagePDF okay so returning to goal settingand pursuit first you need to set yourgoal you really should take the timerequired to Define your priority whatare you going to try and learn and thenyou're going to pick a goal that reallyfeels challenging that feels like itmight even be Out Of Reach because thatwill recruit the neural circuitsassociated with arousal they'remotivating enough to get you into actionnow I want to be very clear I'm notsuggesting that you pick a goal that'simpossible to achieve or that youbelieve is impossible to achieve that'snot going to serve you well rather I'msaying pick a goal that feels just a bitOut Of Reach and don't obsess too muchabout whether or not it's a lot out ofreach or a little bit Out Of Reach picksomething you're excited to pursue thatyou would really like to accomplish setthat goal and then just set aside allother goals still of course maintain orimprove other aspects of your life thatare necessary for daily living formental health physical health Etc butreally just focus on one goal I promisethat you will be far more satisfied withthe results if you can truly set apriority so once you've defined thespecific goal that you are going to"

            "text": "prioritize there are two more thingsthings that you need to do before youstart to pursue that goal the first oneis that you need to define the specificverbs the actions that are involved inpursuing that goal this is absolutelycritical a lot of people will set a sortof title goal or a goal State they'llsay oh you know I want to be rich or Iwant to be smart or they will say I wantto be fit or proficient in a givenlanguage it's really important that youput additional specificity on your goalin fact it's important that you put alot of specificity on your goal and thatyou focus mainly on verbs when definingthat specificity now there are a lot ofreasons for this that have to do bothwith increasing the probability that youwill achieve your goal as well asmaintaining motivation as you pursuethat goal so for instance rather thansaying you want to be fit or you want tobe a better Runner or swimmer you wouldwant to get very specific about the verbthat you're going to engage in order toachieve that goal now it's somewhatobvious in the case of running orswimming I think everyone understandsthat if you want to be a better Runnerthere is going to be some runninginvolved if you want to be a betterswimmer there's going to be someswimming involved of course butpresumably there will be some otherbehaviors as well everything fromdriving to the pool or lacing up yourshoes I mean there's an essentially nearinfinite number of verbs involved in anytype of goal Pursuit so what we aretalking about here is really definingthe goal on a piece of paper and I dothink that's important you should writethis down and I think the process ofselecting your goal that priority aswell as defining the specificity of theverb action that you're going to pursueshould be done on paper you of courseare going to think but then you shouldwrite it out seeing things on paper andwriting them out by hand with pen orpencil really has been shown to engageneural circuitry in a way that isdifferent than typing with your thumbsinto your phone which by the way is anew feature of human evolution I dobelieve this is the first time in humanevolution that we have written with ourthumbs I don't know I don't have a timemachine I can't go back and check butI'm willing to place a bet that thatstatement is correct so the point isthat writing things out is not onlyimportant it's also the most effectiveway to embed knowledge in our nervoussystem so I highly recommend that youwrite things out on a piece of paper inyour process of goal setting so when weare talking about generating verbspecificity about your goal it wouldlook like the following so let's say Iwant to to quote unquote get more fit orlearn conversational French or anythingfor that matter gardening maybe I wantto build a gazebo in the backyard or adeck in the backyard the key thing toanswer is what is the major block ofaction that's going to be involved inpursuing that goal so for instance ifyou want to get more fit and you'regoing to do that primarily throughrunning and weight training or swimmingand weight training you would want toget very specific in defining thatpriority goal as I'm going to run Xnumber of miles per week or I'm going togo to the gym three times per week tolift weights although I would recommendgetting even more specific than that Iwould recommend that you literally writedown I'm going to go to the gym threetimes per week for a minimum of 60minutes where 50 minutes of that arecarrying out hard work okay with ofcourse rest between sets Etc or I'mgoing to attend three classes per weekor perhaps even just one class per weekof learning conversational French plusI'm going to spend two hours per week ofpracticing say word problems ormathematical problems whatever it is youwant to Define first the priority thenyou want to define the verb action thatrepresents the bulk of effort towardsthat priority so running in the case ofthe person who wants to get fit byrunning weightlifting in the case of theperson that wants to get fit byweightlifting though of course I highlyrecommend people do both resistancetraining and uh cardiovascular trainingif indeed they want to be truly fit orin the case of language learning orlearning how to code or gardening orsomething of that sort to really Definethe verb actions involved and then toplace specificity in terms of the amountof time that one is going to try toachieve each week in pursuit of thatspecific priority goal now I realizethat that process itself takes a bit oftime but when you look back on the100-year plus scientific literature ofwhat leads to success uccessful goalsetting and pursuit you find over andover again that those two componentswe've been talking about specificity andmeasurability are Paramount you justsimply cannot discard those from theprocess if you expect yourself toachieve your goals so whether or notit's the ABC method or it's the smartmethod or the smarter method again allacronyms coined not by me but by othersprevious to this conversation you'regoing to find elements of specificityand measurability showing up again andagain so these are key features of anyprotocol that you are going to use inorder to try and set and achieve yourgoals and I should mention that settingspecific goals and clearly defining theverbs that you're are going to engage into pursue those goals and defining howlong you are going to try and engage inthose verbs each week to achieve thosegoals has significant impact on theprobability of success we're not talkingabout a minor effect in fact in theoriginal episode I did about goalsetting and pursuit I talked about theso-called recycling study I'm not goingto describe it in a lot of detail rightnow but essentially this study looked atmotivating people to recycle morerecyclable products in the workplace andwhat they found was that when peoplewere told what the specific goal was andwhat specific actions they needed toengage in were and how much of a givenbatch of refu so say you know afterlunch there's some boxes or some ForksEtc some napkins how much of that refuthey were going to try to put into therecycle versus the trash it led to agreater than doubling of successfulachievement of that goal now that's aperhaps trivial goal to some of youalthough let's face it recycling isimportant but that result has been shownagain and again and again for differentdomains of goal setting and pursuit sothis thing of setting specificity reallyspending time with it on paper settingspecificity of actions of which specificactions and then setting specificity ofhow long you are going to engage in eachof those actions each week greatlyincreases the probability that you willachieve that what previously seemed tobe a all too lofty goal earlier Imentioned that during the course of"

that you shouldtell people you are going to achievethat goal now I realize that there aresome prominent examples in pop cultureof people posting something on socialmedia and saying you know in three yearsI'm going to be you know playing inWembley Stadium or in two years watchI'm going to be at the top level of mygame whatever that game happens to besure there are examples of that andthose are beautiful and inspiringexamples however the scientific datatell us that if we inform people aroundus that for instance we are going towrite a book or that we're going tostart a podcast or that we are going torun a marathon or whatever it happens tobe more often than not we get feedbackthat is generally positive inform Ithink that's good and to be expectedfrankly you know if a friend tells ushey I'm going to write a book or I'mgoing to pursue a new fitness goal orI'm going to learn a language we saygreat go for it you can totally do ityou're very likely to succeed go for ithow do you want me to support you as athere anything I can do to support youthose all are frankly healthy exchangesand yet the data tell us that thepositive feedback that we get fromothers when we announce that we're goingafter a goal activate certain rewardsystems and motivation systems withinour brain that then quickly dissipateand then diminish the probability thatwe'll engage in the type of behaviorsthat actually lead us to achieve thatgoal so we have the posit fallacy and wehave the myth of accountability fallacywithin the context of goal Pursuit I ofcourse am not saying that accountabilityis bad to the contrary accountability isa great thing both to ourselves and toothers it's something that we should allcultivate throughout life I'm merelytalking about the myth of accountabilityin the context of goal Pursuit and I'mactually being more specific than thatI'm saying don't tell people that you'regoing to go out and Achieve somethingprior to initiating action toward thatgoal because in fact the positivefeedback that we get will diminish theprobability that we will continuallypursue that goal in a way that allows usto achieve it so you could interpret theinformation I just gave you as meaningthat perhaps it's better to tell someonewho doubts us that we are going toachieve a goal and then of coursethey're not going to give us thepositive feedback we're not going to getall that reward circuitry activatedrather we're going to get the uhfriction circuitry activated of uswanting to prove ourselves and overcomethe uh let's just say the lack of faithin our ability to achieve a goal andindeed that can work there is evidencethat can work but then of course youhave to find someone who doesn't believein you you have to get them to tell youthey don't believe in you and that couldhave all sorts of deleriouspsychological effects that mightundermine the goal Pursuit process andother things as well so if you are luckyenough to know somebody who doubts yougo ahead tell them that you want topursue your specific priority goal butmore likely than not the best thing todo is to Simply keep that goal toyourself you may need to inform a familymember or others of you know where youwill be between the hours of say 8:00a.m. and 9:00 a.m. if you're going to beexercising or learning language ormeditating whatever it is during thatperiod of time but what I'm referring tohere is what I will call the don't tellthe world rule don't tell the world thatyou're going to achieve X Y or Z justsimply tell yourself in fact I wouldsuggest that the more time you can spendwith that one or two or three sheets ofpaper where you defined the goal thespecific actions that you're going totake how you're going to measureprogress which we'll talk about bit morelater the more time that you can spendwith that goal in your mind and on thatpaper the higher the probability thatyou will achieve that goal that standsin start contrast to telling everyonearound you that you're going to achievea certain goal the so-calledaccountability myth or the myth ofaccountability within the context ofgoal Pursuit would be the more specificway uh to describe that myth now itturns out there is some utility tohaving one person that is a so-calledaccountability buddy if that person isreally just L addressing accountabilitythey are reminding you to do what youneed to do or they are asking you didyou do what you said you were going todo but that's a bit more of a tough loveaccountability model what the don't tellthe world rule is really about is notgetting the kind of dopamine and otherforms of neurochemical reward that comefrom just simply saying that you'regoing to pursue a goal because as you'llsoon learn that dopamine and othermolecules too of course are going to

            "text": "how to define or quantify the goalitself now of course in differentEndeavors you're going to have theopportunity to quantify and Define goalachievement in different ways so forinstance if you want to be able to run asub six-minute mile or a sub five minutemileor if you're really impressive a subfour minute mile well that's a highlyquantifiable goal that you can breakdown into a series of training steps orMilestones meaning that you couldquantify at the beginning of your goalPursuit how long it takes you to run amile you could then set out to achieve afaster time within two weeks or threeweeks and then do the appropriatetraining to achieve those numbers andsimply keep updating that in order toeventually reach your quantifiable goalat 12 weeks again you might not completeyour goal of running a sub five minutemile or sub six minute mile at the endof 12 weeks but perhaps if your goal isto be able to run a sub five minute mileby the end of the calendar year andyou're initiating this whole goalPursuit thing on the first of the yearwell then you have 12 months broken intofour 3month cycles and you wouldessentially set the quantifiable goal atthe end of the year December 31stperhaps is when you actually do that runum where you hopefully would achievethat sub 6 minute or 5 minute mile ormaybe even 4 minute mile and then youbacktrack from that date and you setMilestones of goals that you're tryingto achieve that's a highly quantifiableset of goals because it is literallydistance Over time however in a lot ofPursuits in fact I would argue in mostPursuits you don't have that very clearquantifiable result you might have forinstance the achievement of a doctoraldegree or a bachelor's degree or an AAdegree or a professional degree of somesort which represents a Finish Line umyou could perhaps even attach a graypoint average or a publication goal tothat but in most Endeavors that aren'tathletic or aren't within the realm ofFinance it becomes much harder to veryclearly Define your goal in purelyquantitative terms so that is the reasonwhy we spent so much time talking aboutthe measurability of the specific amountof time that you're going to engage inthe verb actions that each day whichdays each week over the course of these12we Cycles because ultimately what'sgoing to allow you to arrive atsuccessful achievement of your goalregardless of whether or not that goalis highly quantifiable X number ofdollars X number of minutes to completea mile run or SwimEtc or it's something that's a bit morenebulous in terms of quantifiabilitylike conversational French right there'sconversational French that you can learnthere's also conversational French thatincorporates humor or that incorporatesGood Humor or um perhaps you want to getbetter at writing poetry or simply spendtime writing poetry can you quantify thequality of that poetry well perhaps uhyou know if you could win a particularprize for poetry but I think for mostEndeavors they are more Loosely definedin terms of their quantifiability now wecan always attach quantifiability to theultimate end goal if we choose so forinstanceI could decide that I'm going to learnconversational French and I could decidethat the ultimate goal at the end ofthis 12we period is to be able to have a10-minute conversation with somebody whois fluent in French they're native bornin France and that I'm going to makezero mistakes that's a pretty lofty goalbut the point being that if you arepicking a goal that is not easilyquantifiable you want to beexceptionally precise about the amountof time that you are going to spend inengaging in the specific verb actionsthat are going to allow you to makeprogress toward your goal becauseultimately whether or not it's a highlyquantifiable goal or it's a more Looselyquantifiable goal in terms of the endgoal the process of achieving goals isalways going to be in the form ofactions and actions themselves arealways quantifiable it's number of hoursof dedicated work toward that particulargoal a common example of an end goalthat's very hard to quantify in terms ofthe end goal itself is the writing of abook book for instance now you could setout to write an 800 page book but mostpeople agree that the length of the bookshould have something more or less to dowith the content and not the other wayaround in other words that you don'tjust want to add words in order toachieve a certain number of pages thatsaid most all experienced writers willtell you at least two things they'lltell you first don't wait forinspiration simply set a period of timeeach day that you're going to write andwrite X number of words or for x amountof time each each day or perhaps evenjust three days a week but most of theexperienced writers that I've spoken towrite every single day and they write800 words per day or 2,000 words per dayor 500 words per day whatever they cando consistently they may do it for timethey may do it for words but they arewriting during that time they are notwaiting for inspiration to land on themthey're not trying to get optimallycaffeinated and perhaps they didn't evensleep that well the night before inother words they are dedicated toengaging in a particular number of hoursof word generating action rather thantrying to focus on getting the numberone best seller at the end after thebook is published of course they canwish for that number one position on thebestseller chart But ultimately thegreatest probability of achieving thatgoal is going to come from engaging in aparticular number of hours generating aparticular number of words each day soagain the highest probability ofachieving our goals of achieving anykind of goal is going to be byunderstanding the specific verb actionsthat we need to engage in and thenquantifying the amount of time that weengage in those specific word actionsand then simply doing those verbs so upuntil now we've been talking about goal"

            "text": "setting and we really haven't talkedabout goal Pursuit itself so now I'dlike to talk about what the scientificliterature says is the best protocol forinitiating our goal Pursuit for startingtoward our goal and to do so we have toaddress a set of key questions thequestions you have to ask yourself aredo I do I want to pursue this goalmeaning am I highly motivated to pursuethis goal or even mildly motivated topursue this goal do I want to do thethings involved to get this thing toaccomplish this thing or am I feelingresistance do I not want to pursue thisgoal or perhaps this is a daytoday shiftthat occurs where some days you'rereally motivated and other days you arenot now the reason to ask yourself theset of questions is that the data saythat there are two different strategiesin fact two markedly differentstrategies that you'll want toincorporate depending on whether or notyou're motivated or you are unmotivatedto pursue that particular goal forwhatever reason and of course there's anentire psychology to motivation and youcould get a therapist or a coach to workwith in order to address that underlyingpsychology yes it might ladder back toChildhood issues it might ladder back toesteem things none of that can becovered here in any sort of meaningfuldepth because frankly we each havedifferent circumstances different pastsdifferent psychologies there are howeversome universals that we can all apply inorder to help us get started toward ourgoal and this is nested in this wholeconcept of whether or not we shouldvisualize the end and successfulcompletion of our goal so keep the endin mind as we start off toward a goal orwhether or not we should incorporate adifferent strategy here's how it goes soif you askyourself do I want to achieve this goaland I would hope the answer is yesbecause the overall goal should besomething that you want to pursue itshould be something that you are deeplyDesiring to accomplish then you have toask yourself next do I want to do thethings required to achieve that goal nowmaybe you don't want to do all of themyou only want to do some of them butgiven that you've now carefullyQuantified which specific actions you'regoing to be doing on which days and forhow many hours and how many weeks forthese 12we blocks you could simply askyourself you do I want to do this thingtoday and if the answer is yes well thenit turns out that spending just one tothree maybe five minutes but even justone minute visualizing the outcome thepositive outcome of course and thefeeling state that you may have becauseof course you don't know you don't havea uh time machine you can't feelyourself into the future but you canmake a good guess as to how you mightfeel in the future if you accomplishthat goal spending one to three maybefive minutes in a sort of meditationalthough sort of a visualiz a is perhapsthe better way to describe it thinkingabout that feeling State and the outcomeand some of the things that are going tobe associated with that outcome turnsout to be a great practice to engage injust prior to initiating that day's worktoward that goal however if you arriveto your practice meaning you show up tothe piano to learn piano or you'resitting down to the table or maybe youhaven't even gotten enough motivation togo toward the piano or toward yournotebook or computer or whateverlandscape it is that you are going to beuh pursuing your goal with in and youare having quote unquote a hard timegetting motivated toward that goal wellthen it turns out what the scientificliterature tells us is that visualizingthe end keeping the end in mind positivevisualization of all the good thingsthat you'll experience when you achievethat goal is not going to be aneffective strategy to motivate yourather if you are not feeling motivatedthen what the scientific literaturetells us is that you actually want tospend one to three maybe 5 minutesvisualizing failure visualizing howterrible you will feel if you do notachieve your goal visualizing severeconsequences perhaps mostly of the sortlike telling yourself gosh I set a goalI set a 12we block I quantify it I knowI want to do this here I have the timeto do it and I'm simply just not doingit and in that case you would think okaywell you should kind of build yourselfup maybe call a friend text a friend getsome encouragement no the scientificliterat tells us that when we are notmotivated and it is a goal that weactually want to pursue and of coursehere I'm talking about adaptive goalPursuit meaning things that are going toenrich your mental health physicalhealth Etc not things that are going tobe detrimental to us well then if you'renot feeling motivated you want to spendone to three perhaps five minutesmeditating concentrating on what it'sgoing to feel like to fail and the factthat you are not succeeding but indeedthat you are failing and I I know thissounds like rather harsh advice thatthis protocol uh sounds like kind of aself- flatulating protocol it's notintended to be self flatulation in factit should not be self flatulation butrather what you want to do when you arenot motivated is to think about failureand what that failure at the end of 12weeks will feel like and the reason forthat is that the data tell us that whenwe visualize positive outcomes yes itdeploys certain neurochemicals in ourbrain and body that make us feel goodalthough frankly if you've heard thatimagining something creates the sameneurochemical and neuros circuit statesin the brain as actually experiencingthat thing that is simply not truethat's a myth we've talked about this inprevious episodes that's simply not truebut if you are having a hard timegetting motivated toward a goal that youactually want to achieve then spendingthat short amount of time thinking abouthow lousy you'll feel when you don'tachieve it recruits certain elements ofyour so-called autonomic nervous systemit creates shifts in the release ofthings like epinephrine norepinephrineeven release of the so-called rewardmolecule dopamine which in fact is notthe molecule of reward it is themolecule of motivation and it'sassociated with pain It's associatedwith negative thoughts and of courseit's associated with positive thoughtsand outcomes but basically what I'msaying is if you're highly motivated todo something you're ready to go spendone to three minutes maybe fivevisualizing the positive outcomes thatyou're going to EXP experience when youultimately finish out that 12 we cycleas a consequence of all the great workthat you've done if however you are notmotivated you're feeling like I don'twant to do this thing I'mprocrastinating I'm just not feelinglike doing it yes I want to achieve thegoal but I just don't feel like doing itwell then your task is to take one tothree maybe five minutes and think abouthow much more lousy you will feel whenyou do not achieve that goal at the endof 12 weeks and that the data tell usrecruit certain elements of your nervoussystem your hormonal system that aremore successful in getting you intoaction into starting toward your goalthan were you to try and build yourselfup towards all that positivity so yesindeed there is a place for negativethinking I'd like to take a quick breakand acknowledge our sponsor inside"

instance there aretools that you can use to stay motivatedwithin the 1hour learning block that youhappen to be doing on Monday morning forinstance and there are other tools andprotocols that you can incorporatetowards staying motivated from one dayto the next or from one week to the nextbut I think the most useful of thosetools are going to be the tools that youincorporate to stay motivated within agiven training block or practice blocktoward your goal because what I justdescribed a few minutes ago was theprocess of how to initiate your dailywork right you ask yourself thatquestion am I motivated the answer couldbe yes could be no if you really want toget you know uh quantitative about ityou could give yourself a 1 to 10 score10 being the most motivated frankly I'mnot that quantitative about that sort ofthing I'm more subjective about it but Iknow some of you are real um numberjunkies and you really like to quantifyeverything keep a journal and look backsee how that relates to your sleep youknow some people are of that orientationother people like myself are simplygoing to you know sit down and say okayit's time it's time to train or it'stime to practice whatever the thing maybe how motivated am I am I a I don'tknow like a six out of 10 or a seven outof 10 okay I'm ready to go I'm going tovisualize the end in mind in a positiveway or if I'm a two out of 10 oranything less than a four out of 10 I'mthinking I'm not that motivated so thenI'm going to basically scare myself intodoing the work that day so that's howyou initiate the work each day and Ijust gave you a couple of quick examplesof how you could quantify that took meabout 30 seconds to do that example outloud take you about 30 seconds to do butagain if you want to quantify it in moredetail and write it down and relate itto other things be my guest so now youalready have a science based protocolfor how to get started each day towardyour goal now what about within the oneor twoh hour block or perhaps 90-minuteblock that you're going to use to pursueyour goal and here it's very importantthat you have a number of tools thatwill allow you to both set the optimalamount of focus so that you're reallyconcentrating on pursuing that goalyou're concentrated on the verb actionsthat will deliver you to that goal isperhaps the best way to state that andthat you can constantly update or renewyour level of focus should it start todissipate now I want to be clear I'vedone entire episodes about focus and howto increase focus with behavioral toolseverything related to meditation whichindeed can increase your ability tofocus I've talked about nutritionaltools supplementation tools prescriptiondrug related tools there's a lot ofinformation on that you can simply go tohubman lab.com put focus into the searchfunction and it will take you to notonly those episodes and the toolkit forthat but the specific timestamps forthat but what we are going to talk aboutnow is not about how to increase Focusper se rather it's about how to usefocus in particular visual focus inorder to increase your or maintain yourlevel of motivation within a givenlearning block within a given batch oftime on a given day where you arepursuing your goal you're engaging inthat practice which of course willinclude frustration anxiety it has to ifyou're going to get any better and howto set that motivation and keep thatmotivation throughout that hour or 90minutes or two hours is critical so howdo you do that well it turns out it'sfairly straightforward so it's anchoredin the fact that your cognitive Focusyour ability to maintain a narrow coneof attention as well as your bodilystate of Readiness and your mental stateof Readiness to perform work ispowerfully anchored to your visualsystem as many of you have heard me saybefore your eyes are actually two piecesof brain I mean to be more specific theneural retinas that line the back ofyour eyes like py crust are literallytwo pieces of your central nervoussystem of your brain that were extrudedfrom the cranial Vault duringdevelopment so yes these two bits andfor those listening I'm just pointing tomy eyes your eyes are two pieces ofbrain outside of your skull and youreyes can view things broadly so so youcan uh so-called soften your gaze andview the entire Horizon you can see theperiphery of the room by relaxing youreyes you can actually do this now infact when you drive most of the timeyou're doing this you're not looking ata particular focal point you're viewingthings in so-call panoramic vision andof course you can draw your visual Focusto a particular location what we call avirgin eye movement that is you'rebringing your eyes in toward the centertoward your nose a little bit and you'refocusing them in a more narrow cone ofvisual attention this is something youcan do almost imperceptibly to othersalthough if we were to measure your eyemovements what we would see is that youreyes are actually moving inward a littlebit toward your nose when you do thisvirgin eye movement and narrowing thatcone of visual attention and thenthey're you relaxing into a state of umbeing slightly further out from yournose not the eyes themselves of coursethey can't move within the sockets butyou know the pupils of your eyes aremoving out a bit from your nose andyou're in so-called panoramic Vision soessentially what I'm saying is that youcan narrow or broaden your visualattention and that's something that cantake a little bit of practice I highlyrecommend that you try this and that youpractice it a little bit but indeedeveryone has the neural Machinery to dothis from birth this is not somethingthat requires neuroplasticity to be ableto do you can do this right now you cannarrow your visual attention you canexpand or relax your visual attentionand thereby narrow or relax your visualfield from being smaller or larger thereare data that show that when we narrowour visual attention and we hold thatnarrow visual tension on a spot severalthings happen first of all there'srecruitment of circuitry within theso-called brain stem that then deploysneurochemicals that increase our levelof alertness and arousal that's rightwhen you focus your visual attension ona more narrow location or one locationin front of you and you hold thatFocus you are causing the release ofneurochemicals that increase youroverall level of alertness in the brainbrain and body conversely when you relaxyour visual Focus so-called panoramicVision you are turning off thatrecruitment you're not activelyrecruiting molecules for relaxationwithin the brain but you are turning offthis release of the neurochemicalsassociated with increasing focus andarousal so why am I talking about thisin the context of goal Pursuit well ifyou are feeling lack of motivation atany point within a given training blockor bism calling it this could be at thebeginning this could be 5 minutes inthis could be half an hour in you wouldbe wise to pick a visual Target ideallya visual Target that is within thegeneral range of the work that you'retrying to perform in other words ifyou're doing desk work with a piece ofpaper you would draw that visual Targeton a piece of paper approximately thesame distance that you were reading orthat you were looking at music um youcan tell how little uh playing of pianoI've done in my life but the point beingthat you set the visual Target at aapproximately the same distance that youwould be performing your particular workso if you're doing a sport the distancemight be some many meters off in thedistance whereas if you're doing deskwork of some kind then it might be muchcloser and then you focus your eyes onthat location and you actively work tomaintain that Focus just like I'm doingnow into the camera for a given periodof time and I recommend that you set atimer and that you of course allowyourself to Blink like I just did thereand that you try and Achieve at least 30seconds but even better would be 60seconds even better would be 90 secondsof that Focus virgin eye movement duringwhich several things happen includingthe deployment of those neurochemicalsfrom the brain stem that I talked aboutbefore which are going to increase yourlevel of autonomic arousal and alsoincrease your level of focus further andthere I'm not just talking about visualFocus I'm talking about cognitive focusit has also been shown that when wefocus on a particular point in the waythat I'm describing here that itincreases our so-called systolic bloodpressure as many of you know bloodpressure is always described to us as agiven number over another number and thefirst number is the so-called systo orsystolic pressure which is the amount ofpressure your vascular system when theheart beats as the fluid of your bloodis pumping through the arteries veinsand capillaries of your system and thenthe bottom number is the amount ofpressure within those arteries veins andcapillar iies in between heartbeat soit's the systolic over the diastolic andwhat we know is that visual focus andhere I'm still holding mine now on thecamera so for those of you listening Iprobably blinked once or twice but I'mreally trying hard to maintain my focusdirectly within the camera this visualFocus increases the systolic bloodpressure it increases the deployment ofthose neurochemicals from the brain stemand we know it also can recruit TheLiberation of molecules such as dopamineand some Associated molecules elsewherein the brain that together act in asynergistic way to increase our level offocus and motivation this is based againon work describing the neural circuitryof what I'm describing here and workfrom Emily bis's lab which has shownthat if people focus on a Target on agoal line literally a physical locationwithin their environment and then theyinitiate some work it could be physicalwork or cognitive work not only do theyexperience significantly decreasedlevels of perceived effort whileengaging in that work but they alsocomplete that work in a significantlyreduced amount of time meaning thatwithin a given training bout or trainingblock you are able to get significantlymore work done and you perceive that asless effortful or requiring less effortthan had you not done this visual Focusnow I've been doing this for quite sometime now into the camera this isactually a practice that I've been doingfor well over a decade and it's actuallya practice that I use when I podcast orwhen I post on social media it's part ofthe reason why I'm accused of being anon- blinker quite often but I want toremind people that you are allowed toBlink don't let your eyes dry out it'sperfectly fine to Blink it's not goingto inhibit the effectiveness of thisprotocol but I don't think I can reallyoverstate how valuable this sort ofprotocol is first of all it's completelybehavioral it costs nothing it'scompletely safe as long as you rememberto Blink and it allows you to increaseyour level of focus your level ofmotivation and the sustainability ofyour focus and motivation while in goalPursuit so it's a quite valuableprotocol to incorporate and it'ssomething that you can do once for 30seconds and then lean into whatever itis your writing process your runningprocess it's something that you could dorepeatedly throughout that learning boutand it's something that you can practiceoffline a little bit away from thattraining bout as a means to sort oflearn and get familiar with so that thenyou can incorporate it very quickly andrepeatedly and with much moreEffectiveness during these differentlearning doubts again it's a highlyvaluable tool that's ground grounded inneural circuitry grounded inneurochemistry and that Emily bis's labhas shown in numerous domains physicalPursuits cognitive Pursuits can reallyhelp people achieve their goals and toachieve them more easily or at leastwith less perceived effort and morequickly now we can get a bit moregranular about the incorporation of thistool this protocol but before we do weshould acknowledge that all of thethings that lend themselves to improvedcognitive focus and physical abilitystill hold true right you still need toget good sleep as many nights of yourlife as you possibly can you still needto eat properly you still need to tryand limit your stress we have podcastepisodes related to all of those topicswe have toolkits available at zero costrelated to all of those topics I'm notsaying that this visual Focus or visualTarget Training is the only tool thatyou should incorporate it's a tool thatyou want to superimpose on thefoundation of all the things that bringyou to your practice with the bestpossible cognition the best possiblephysical Readiness and that when addedto that Foundation of excellent sleepexcellent nutrition social connectionsunlight in the morning Etc is going toincrease the probability that you'regoing to make those learning bouts aseffective as possible now some of youmay be thinking elevating your bloodpressure is bad why would I want toelevate my blood pressure ah well itturns out that these increases insystolic blood pressure achieved withthis visual Target Training or focusingon a Finish Line for some period of timeare transient and they are perfect lysafe so essentially what it does is itboosts or bolsters the activity of theautonomic nervous system it kickstartsthe deployment of those chemicals andthose neural circuits that then allowyou to be motivated for some period oftime but then that is a transientincrease in autonomic rousel which iswhy perhaps every 20 minutes or perhapson the hour you might stop do a 30second or 60-second visual TargetTraining and then lean back into yourprocess of however you it is that youare pursuing your goal I should alsomention that if your eyes are gettingtired doing whatever goal Pursuit youhappen to be engaged in it's also a goodidea to go into that panoramic Visionmode the easiest way to do that is to gooutside or to be outside and to view ahorizon and not look at any oneparticular point on the horizon but ifyou're indoors as I am now you can alsojust relax your eyes you know you knowblinking a few times and getting rid ofthat virgin's eye movement and try andvisualize the corners of the room or thesides of the room rather the floor andthe ceiling all at once that's a goodway to expl expl how to so-call relaxyour eyes and take you out of thatvirgin's eye movement and I say thisbecause a lot of people will feel whenthey're pursuing their goal that it'skind of fatiguing so you have toremember to Breathe Right you still wantto breathe as you're pursuing your goaland you certainly want to be visuallyfocused on your goal so you'recognitively focused on your goal andyou're motivated but that from time totime you also relax take a moment shakethings off look into your panoramicVision mode and then go back to yourmode of goal Pursuit now there are a fewother protocols that might seem Oho"

previouslyand we can provide a link to all threeof those as well as the toolkit thatwe've published and that's available toyou at zero cost on our website abouthow to regulate dopamine both Baselinedopamine stores and peaks in dopaminethere's a lot there to be understood andIncorporated because it has to do withvarious things not just in the realm ofgoal Pursuit but also feelings ofwell-being um staving off depressionthings of that sort the dopamine systemis linked to oh so many importantaspects of Life far too many than wecould discuss right now and we havethose previous episodes in which we dodiscuss all of that material nonethelessit is important to understand thatdopamine is the molecule of motivationand to some extent reward but reallymotivation and that if you want tomaintain consistent motivation duringsay your individual bouts of work towardyour goals and from one bout to the nextso not just within a session but fromday to day across sessions and from weekto week and indeed from 12we cycle to12we cycle if that's required and fromone goal that you set to the next goalthat you define and decide to pursue youwant to understand this particularfeature of dopamine which is that yesdopamine and its release is highlyvaluable toward getting more motivatedand feeling more motivated but that ithas certain properties related to thingslike dopamine reward prediction errorbaselines of dopamineEtc that make it the case that if youreward yourself every time you reach amilestone say you finish out an hour ortwo hours of work so you treat yourselfto something you reward yourself thatyou are going to diminish both thepotency of that reward and you are goingto reduce your motivation over time thatmight be surprising to you but if youwere to watch those episodes it wouldall become clear as to why that is thecase it is also true that if you were toonly reward yourself when you accomplishyour goal or perhaps more commonly ifyou look at the accomplishment of yourgoal as the only reward in the wholeprocess of goal Pursuit and achievementthat is going to undermine yourprobability of success as well ratherthe best way to incorporate themechanics of the dopamine system suchthat you can achieve not just immediatemotivation but ongoing motivation is toincorporate what is referred to asrandom intermittent reinforcement whichis what the casinos use to keep peopleplaying it simplymeans randomly reward yourself andrandomly don't reward yourself forsuccessful completion of Milestonesthose Milestones could be within a boutof effort or it could be across bouts ofeffort so let's say you set out at thebeginning on your piece of paper tobasically let's say run or practice atsome cognitive Endeavor four hours totalper week and you're going to do thatMonday Wednesday Friday and Saturdayshould you reward yourself at the end ofeach session should you reward yourselfat the end of each week the answer is itdepends and it should depend in a randomintermittent way so the simplest way todo this is whenever you complete amilestone could be at the end of a dayyou did your one hour whatever it wasthat you designated you were going to doon that particular day should you rewardyourself cognitively or with somephysical thing I don't know what thatphysical thing might be but it I don'tknow could be a meal could be a moviecould be something that you enjoy wellthe answer is you should flip a coin andif it's heads yes reward yourself and ifit's Tails don't it's that simple it isthat simple it should be 50/50probability and it's random as towhether or not you reward yourself nowwith physical rewards like monetaryRewards or food rewards or a movie orparticipating in something else that youenjoy it's a bit easier to define thecognitive rewarding of One's Own effortsis something that people really struggleto comprehend but what I'm not referringto when I say cognitive rewards is I'mnot referring to saying yes I'm the bestand really trying to shower yourselfwith internal praise and tell yourselfthat you're the greatest thing that everhappened simply because you performedthis learning bout what I'm simplyreferring to is the kind ofinternal dopamine reward that comes fromtelling yourself like yes I'm makingprogress I'm making progress I'm on thepath I'm able to set a goal and achievea goal which might seem like a healthything to do psychologically and in factit is it's great I think it's reallyimportant that people be able toself-reward themselves especiallyself-reward for verbs that put them in amore adaptive stance in life thatenhance their mental health physicalhealth and performance and that ofcourse also includes relationships we'renot just talking about solitary Pursuitshere we're talking about Pursuits thatbring us into the world that allow us tolean into life with more Vigor and withmore Effectiveness not just to helpourselves but to help others so what I'mreferring to is completing something andinternally patting yourself on the backfor having completed that thing thingthat is a good thing to do but if youwant to maintain ongoing motivationyou're not going to do that every timeyou're not going to punish yourself butrather you finish out a bout of learningyou flip the coin let's say it landstails on that day you simply shift intothe next thing you need to do that daynow it is not easy to suppress thoughtswe know this it's very hard to suppressnegative thoughts but it's still hard tosuppress positive thoughts so internallyif you're glowing from the fact that youperformed well don't try and suppressthat that's okay but if you flip a Tailsthen you don't want to actively engagein a self-reward process however if youflip the coin and it's heads well thenyou should absolutely engage in aself-reward process and that processshould consist of 30 to 60 seconds ofclosing your eyes well you don't have toit works better if you close your eyesand simply thinking about the fact thatyes you can set a goal you can engage inthe specific set of questions do I wantto do this practice today do I not wantto do this practice today and then thespecific set of actions maybe theyinvolve visual focus and the other toolswe talked about turning off of yourphone Etc and you are somebody who canget things done you are somebody that ismoving forward toward your particulargoal and so you just sort of create alittle bit of a positive cognitive looparound that ability that you are in factbuilding up and that's something thatpeople often Overlook which is that notonly is moving toward a goal greatbecause it establishes more robustnessin the neural circuits that allow us toperform that thing right I mean afterall that's what learning is eventuallyyou don't achieve the same frustrationand errors that you do when trying toperform that thing eventually you learnhow to play the piano you learn how tospeak conversational French you run thatsub six-minute mile but also the neuralcircuits associated with self-generatedmotivation and with the tools that we'retalking about themselves are subject toneuroplasticity so those become morerobust and that's fantastic because whenyou eventually reach one goal I wouldhope that you would then update and setout to achieve another goal and you willfind that over time you will be moreeffective in achieving other goals byvirtue of the work that you did inpursuing a previous goal becauseultimately it's really about defininggoals and then learning how to quantifythe actions required and then engagingin those actions so there's the specificcircuits involved in generating thoseactions which are very goal specific andthen there are the circuits whichcircuits are we talking about we'retalking about that amydala the lateralprefrontal cortex the orbital frontalcortex and the basil ganglia we talkedabout earlier that have been built upthat have been reinforced because as Imentioned there is one universal circuitfor goal Pursuit and achievement SoRandom intermittent reinforcement is thekey and while I spent a good amount oftime talking about self-generatedcognitive reinforcement this alsoapplies to any kind of physical rewardsthe movie that you're going to rewardyourself with the ice cream cone thewhatever that you're going to rewardyourself with perhaps it's monetaryperhaps it's food perhaps it's socialrandom intermittent rewards are the onesthat are going to keep you motivated andare going to best increase theprobability of success not just within agiven bout of learning not just daytoday not just week to week not justquarter to quarter but across thelifetime an important protocol toincorporate in your goal Pursuits is one"

            "text": "that I learned from Dr Maya Shankar whenshe was a guest on the huban Lab podcastand she talked about the so-calledmiddle problem the middle problem is thefact that people tend to have a lot ofmotivation at the outset of pursuing agoal although you now know thatsometimes or some people don't have alot of motivation when pursuing theirgoal at the start so they need to thinkabout failures and how terribleeverything will be and then they willcertainly have motivation it's going tobe a fear-based motivation but ingeneral people tend to have moremotivation at the start of pursuing agoal and at the end when they get closeto or they start start to perceive thefinish line but that most peopleexperience the so-called middle problemwhere in the middle of a learning boutor in the middle of the week or in themiddle of a 12-week cycle they are lessmotivated and this has actually beenQuantified in numerous studies and thereare several ways to overcome the middleproblem the simplest one is toacknowledge it to recognize that it'scoming and so when it does come andyou're experiencing lower levels ofmotivation perhapseven increased failure rates and you'renot performing as well you're gettingfrustrated to know that that's a naturalprocess that everybody experiences andjust knowing that can sometimes allowpeople to move through that to the placewhere then they can sense the end of thelearning bout or they can sense thatthey're making some progress the finishline is there and then they get thatincrease in motivation again howeversometimes the middle problem is such aproblem that people need some tools tomove through it and and the best way tomove through the middle problem or infact to eliminate it is actually to makethe middle of a learning bout its ownseparate thing that you acknowledge thepresence of and that you break up intothree separate bouts so here we'retalking about carving up the 1 hourlearning bout or the two-hour learningbout into an initial phase where youeither have naturally occurringmotivation or you use fear-basedvisualization to increase yourmotivation you lean into that and thenlet's assume it's a 1H hour learningbout and then at about the 25 minuteMark you start to experience lowerlevels of focus perhaps then you use thevisual Target protocol but then you goback into your bout of learning andyou're not feeling very motivated it'shard your mind is drifting you want topick up your phone you want to do otherthings you find yourself doing otherthings that's the period of time to takeSay the 25 minute to 45 minute periodwithin the session and divide it intoperhaps three or even four smallerchunks of time and you perhaps haveheard of chunking before chunking issimply breaking something down intosmaller chunks that are more achievablethat's simply what we're talking abouthere but really chunking up that middlesection of a learning bout can be veryeffective at essentially eliminating themiddle problem now for those of you thatare going to be really nitpicky you'llsay wait you take that 20 minutes fromthe 25 minute Mark to the 45 minute Markwithin your hour learning bout and youdivide it up into four little uh chunksand in those two middle chunks I'm goingto feel the middle problem for those twomiddle chunks ah well that's not notactually the way it pans out fortunatelywhen you break things down into smallenough chunks you eliminate the middleproblem and you experience sustainedmotivation now the extremeinterpretation of that would have youmeasuring every minute or even everysecond of a learning bout and havingconsistent motivation throughout thatbecause for instance if you canconcentrate for 10 seconds why wouldn'tyou simply be able to just mark off10-second increments well at some pointthe marking off or the monitoring ofthose increments is going to bedistracting to toward the thing that youactually want to do so the simple thingto do is to acknowledge the middleproblem right the fact that we have moremotivation at the start and at the endof our goal Pursuit sessions than we dowithin the middle and then to Simplychunk that middle section into threemaybe four smaller chunks and if youneed to incorporate things like thevisual Target protocol one or three orperhaps even eight times within thatmiddle section so be it it's going tohelp you move through with better focusand better motivation and what I justdescribed can of course be applied tothe longer bouts of effort that don'toccur just during one learning bout butperhaps across the week so for instanceif you are doing four days a week oflanguage learning or Fitness training somaybe it's a Monday Wednesday FridaySaturday type of Schedule H you maynotice that in the middle of the weekthe Wednesday training session tends tobe the one that you're less motivated todo for whatever reason there could beany reason at all for which themotivation is lower in the middle of theweek it doesn't matter well in that caseyou would want to First acknowledge thepresence of the middle problem so youwould want to acknowledge that thatWednesday training bout is prone to themiddle problem because it is indeed themiddle problem it's in the middle of theMonday and the Friday training bouts sothen you would want to approach it withthe understanding that it's going to bethere and that you are going to needtools and protocols that will allow youto overcome it by for instance takingthat one or two hour session onWednesdays and putting a bit more timetoward a visual Target protocol at thebeginning to increase your focus a bitmore more visualizing failure if you arefeeling amotivated that means notmotivated in nerd speak amotivatedtoward doing that Wednesday session andyou would want to break up thatWednesday session into smaller chunks soinstead of looking at that 2hour sessionyou might break it up into a series of15 minute smaller learning bouts doneconsecutively back toback and then indoing so you have essentially taken thatWednesday session and I'll bet that itbecomes at least among your mostmotivated sessions so the middle problemexists it's important to acknowledge andthere are tools to overcome the middleproblem on any time scale you simplyhave to Chunk Up the middle and approachthings with deliberate increased Vigorjust as you would you know if you'rerunning and there's always a tough Hillyou have to really or gear up forattacking that hill and then to do thatrepeatedly in those smaller chunks untilyou've completed that session so todayI've been talking about how to approach"

trainingsessions or the practice sessions towardachieving that goal what I haven'ttalked about is how to show up to all ofthat in the best possible State of Mindand Body in order to achieve the bestpossible results and of course there arenumerous things that we need to do inorder to quote unquote show up at ourbest where we would stand the bestpossibility of Performing our best andlearning the best in those learningbouts things like getting adequate sleepgetting sunlight in our eyes early inthe day adequate and proper nutritionsocial connection and so on we talkedabout all of that on previous podcastepisodes so I'm not going to talk aboutthose again now but it is important torecognize that the backdrop of Our Liveshow well we've slept what's going on inour personal lives will all Impactthings like motivation and frankly ourability to even identify what'simportant because you know if we'redealing with a Health crisis or someoneclose to us is dealing with a Healthcrisis we tend to have our attentiondiverted toward that but I do want toacknowledge all of that because it iscritically important in defining howyou're going to show up to theseEndeavors and for that matter allEndeavors now with that said there are afew things that you can do in order totry and optimize your ability to focusand your level of motivation during yourgoal Pursuits and there are some reallyinteresting data and protocols that Ihaven't talked so much about on thispodcast ever that are relevant totoday's discussion and this relates toour so-called circadian rhythms inattention we have robust rhythms in ourability to focus and our level ofmotivation that vary across the 24-hourAKA circadian cycle with a regularrhythmicity that is independent of howbadly we want a goal or how afraid weare of failure right all the stuff aboutmotivation and fear of failure anddesire Etc all of that is still true butwe all have a naturally occurring rhythmof rise and fall and return to rise andfall of our levels of attention andmotivation and this is something that'sbeen described beautifully in thescientific literature in fact I'llprovide a link to what I consider areally nice review on this topic this isa review that was published by PabloValdes in the Yale Journal biology andMedicine in 2019 entitled circadianrhythms in attention and there's a lotof information within this review but wecan distill out of a couple of usefulgems from it so if you are somebody whois embarking on the pursuit of a goalwhich is particularly hard that's goingto require a really high level ofmotivation and focus know that there arethree times during the day when youstand to have the greatest level offocus and attention and of course thiswill vary depending on when you went tosleep at night and when you wake upthere's natural variation in circadianrhythms but it's worth knowing that mostpeople find that their level ofattention and motivation is going to behighest 30 minutes 3 hours and 11 hoursafter waking up okay so 30 minutes 3hours and 11 hours after waking up andthis relates to a number of importantbiological principles related tocircadian shifts in body temperaturewhich are also related to circadianshifts that means changes around the24-hour cycle in the release ofparticular neurochemicals so the amountof dopamine available to be released byany sort of goal pursuit or reward theamount of Serotonin available lots ofneurochemistry in there lots of neuralcircuitry but these heighten levels offocus and motivation that just occurnaturally regardless of what goal one istrying to pursue in fact regardless ofwhether or not you're trying to pursueany goal 30 minutes 3 hours and 11 hoursafter waking your focus and motivationare going to be their greatest relativeto other times in that 24-hour cycle nowas I tell you this I can imagine thatsome of you are thinking great I'm goingto schedule one bout of goal Pursuits 3hours after waking and another one 11hours after waking great if you can dothat and that fits with your work andother demands of Life your relationshipsEtc terrific however I don't want this30 minute 3-hour and 11-hour protocol tobe considered a rule and here's why mostpeople don't have a tremendous degree ofcontrol over their schedule things likework and family and other demandsconstrain them in terms of when they canget the work in and while I do thinkit's extremely valuable to schedule thespecific time or roughly the specifictime even though know that's an oxymoronmeaning a period of time during the daysay before 9:00 a.m. or between 9:00 andnoon that you are going to carry outyour goal Pursuit Endeavors I've talkedabout this in previous podcasts somepeople do very well by scheduling anexact time from noon to 2 I'm writingother people like myself do a littlebetter if I set a constraint but it's alittle bit broader such as I'm going toexercise before 9 a.m. that could beanytime before 9:00 a.m. or I'm going toengage in language learning some timebetween say 6:00 p.m. and 9:00 p.m. asopposed to setting a specific timethat's just what works best for mepeople vary in terms of whether or notthey respond best to setting a specifictime or a Time block and setting upthese kind of barriers after which youare essentially telling yourself youwon't do it but and this is a veryimportantbut it is most important that youactually engage in the goal Pursuit andI experienced this recently I'm tryingto run more these days uh I still enjoydoing resistance training I still runthree days a week but I'm trying to runa little bit longer as opposed to justdoing the one long run per week and thentwo shorter runs later in the week I'vetalked about this in my optimal Fitnessprotocol episode if you want to checkthat out or check out the PDF where it'sall distilled down to one or two pagesif you like but in any event these daysI'm trying to extend the amount of timethat I'm running I'm just enjoying thatit's kind of a throwback for me to whenI ran across country as a senior in highschool and this was the time of yearwhen I would start getting ready for thefall season so I'm enjoying running moreand just this last week I had theexperience of having a very full Sundayand that's usually the day when I run inthe morning or hike during the middle ofthe day and I simply did not get aroundto it because I had a lot of otherimportant things to do and what I foundwas 9 p.m. rolled around 10 p.m. rolledaround and I started thinking ah like Iwish I had gone running my Monday wasgoing to be busy so what did I do Ilaced up my shoes and I went for a runat 1000 p.m. something I haven't donesince college or maybe even high schooland I ended up running for 90 minutesfrom 10: p.m. until 11:30 p.m.definitely not the optimal time for meto go running in fact I was thinking ohthis might disrupt my sleep but in factit didn't I came back I showered had alittle bit of food which normally Idon't eat that late and I slept like ababy and I felt great the next daywaking up at my normal time which cuesme to another important scientific fact"
