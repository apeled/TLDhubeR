            "text": "Andrew Huberman: [OPENING THEME\nMUSIC] Welcome to the Huberman Labpodcast, where we discuss science and\nscience-based tools for everyday life.I'm Andrew Huberman, and I'm a professor\nof Neurobiology and Ophthalmologyat Stanford School of Medicine.Today, my guest is Dr.Robert Malenka.Dr.Robert Malenka is a professor of\nPsychiatry and Behavioral Sciences atStanford University School of Medicine.He is both medical doctor, an\nMD, and a researcher, a PhD.His laboratory is famous for having\ndiscovered some of the key componentsallowing neuroplasticity, that is,\nthe nervous system's ability tochange in response to experience.In addition, Dr.Malanka's research is considered\ncentral to the textbook knowledgeabout how reward systems in the\nbrain are organized and function.Indeed, Dr.Melanca's research over the last ten or\n15 years has merged what was once twodisparate fields, the first being the\nstudy of neuroplasticity, again, thenervous system's ability to change in\nresponse to experience, and the otherfield being the field of dopamine as\nit relates to pleasure and addiction.His laboratory has shown, for instance,\nthat when we seek out particular formsof pleasure, regardless of whether or not\nthey are healthy for us, that changes theway that our reward circuitry works and\nactually changes the way that dopamineis released and how it impacts the brain.And his work has also informed how we\nseek out healthy pleasures, includinghealthy food and social connection.Today's discussion explores all of\nthese topics, and by the end of today'sdiscussion, you will have a rich\nunderstanding of how neurochemicals likedopamine and serotonin work in parallel,\nto reinforce that is, to increase theprobability that we will engage in\ncertain types of thinking and behaviors.So if you are somebody interested\nin neuroplasticity, that is, how thenervous system can change in response\nto experience and or you are interestedin reward systems, what motivates us,\nand what we are likely to pursue inthe future, given our choices of past,\nand if you are interested in thingslike social connection and empathy,\nor lack thereof, today's discussionencompasses all of those topics.It is worth mentioning that Dr.Malenka is a true luminary in all\nof the fields I just mentioned,as well as several other fields.In fact, when you look out on the\nlandscape of modern neuroscience,what you'll discover is that a\nvery large percentage of the toplaboratories studying neuroplasticity\nand reward systems and so on, allstemmed from having trained in Dr.Malenka's laboratory.So it's a real honor and pleasure to\nbe able to host him today, and I'm surethat our discussion is going to greatly\nenrich the way that you think about brainfunction, neuroplasticity, and reward.Before we begin, I'd like to emphasize\nthat this podcast is separate from my"

psychiatrist\nand of course as a luminary in the fieldof neuroplasticity, dopamine and reward\nsystems, social systems, your knowledgeof autism and social interactions,\na newer interest in, or perhaps oldinterest in psychedelics and what they're\ndoing and potential for mental health.There are just so many things\nthat you've done in this field.I've been a long,\nlongtime fan of your work.Since your days as an assistant\nprofessor, I've tracked your career.I've learned a tremendous amount\nfrom you by observing you andfrom being your colleague.So really delighted to have you here.Robert Malenka: You're making me\nblush, and I don't blush easily.Andrew Huberman: Well, it's all true.Robert Malenka: Thank you.Andrew Huberman: And I will say as\nwell, you've also trained an enormousnumber of incredible scientists.Karl Deisseroth, the Karl Deisseroth,\nAnna Lemke always speaks incrediblyhighly of you as a mentor and somebody\nshe's learned a tremendous amount fromand pretty much anyone that's worked on\nneuroplasticity, on dopamine and rewardsystems, addiction, and now in the\nfields of autism and soon psychedelicsas well, references you often, and you've\nbeen mentioned many times before onthis podcast, if not by name, by work.So again, thank you for being here.I'd love to kick off the conversation\nby talking about something which is veryfundamental to everything we're going\nto talk about, but certainly fundamentalto our daily lives, which is dopamine.We hear so much about dopamine.People talk about dopamine hits.People think about dopamine as pleasure,\ndopamine reward for the novice.How would you frame the dopamine system?I mean, it does a bunch of different\nthings in different areas ofthe brain and body, but to you\nwhat does dopamine represent asits major function in the brain?And could you give us a kind of\ngeneral contour of the neural circuitsthat allow this chemical to more or\nless put value on our experiences?Robert Malenka: Yeah,\nthat's very well put.As you point out, dopamine is one of\nthe major, what we term neuromodulatorsin the brain, a chemical signaling\nmessenger that the brain uses tomediate a complex array of actions.Its best well known function is in what\nwe call the brain's reward circuitry.So this is a circuit in the brain.And when we use the term circuit,\nwhat we really mean is onepart of the brain communicating\nwith another part of the brain.Because the brain is this very\ncomplex, it's the most complexorgan in the universe, with lots\nof different nerve cells talkingto each other simultaneously.And as neuroscientists, we try to parse\nwhat different brain areas are doing andwhat different neuromodulators might be\ndoing, and dopamine was discovered, oh,I should know this, many decades ago.And it's, as I said, the major\nchemical messenger molecule in theso called brain's reward circuitry.And when you're talking about, so\nwhat is the brain's reward circuitry?This is a part of the brain\nthat tells us something isreinforcing in our environment.Some stimuli is \"rewarding,\" makes\nus feel better or good, althoughthat's a gross oversimplification.Before getting into the details of\ndopamine and its function in the rewardcircuitry, I think it's useful to talk\nabout, why do we need a reward circuitry?Why do we need something in our brain\nthat tells us, this feels good or thisfeels bad, and it goes back to evolution.I am a biological scientist.That means I believe in evolution.And if you think about the evolution\nof our species, everything isdriven by developing mechanisms\nthat increase our survival.And it's really useful, you need something\nin your nervous system that tells yousome stimuli in your environment is\nimportant for your survival, or somestimulus in your environment is dangerous.So it's not magic that sugary,\nhigh fat laden foods are highlyreinforcing and rewarding.It's not an accident.There has to be a mechanism in\nthe brain that tells us that.It's not an accident, that most\nof the time, for most of us,a sexual experience is pretty\nreinforcing, is pretty rewarding.It's not an accident that warmth\nfeels really good when you're cold.That water tastes much better\nwhen you're really thirsty.What evolved is a mechanism to tell\nour nervous systems and tell ourbrains, this feels pretty good,\nI should repeat the behavior thatleads to that rewarding experience.And similarly, it's really important when\nthere is an event in your life that'shighly dangerous for some mechanism in\nyour brain to say, whoa, I don't wantto go back to where that lion was.And we can get into that.So this was a long winded way of\nsaying what the reward circuitrytells us is this event, this stimulus.It could be an external stimulus,\nlike I said, a Krispy Kremedonut, which I happen to love.And I have to be very disciplined,\nso I don't eat too many of them.It could be a drug of abuse, and maybe\nwe'll talk about that a little bit.All of these stimuli seem to activate\nand cause the release of dopaminein this brain's reward circuitry.So now we need to get into\na little bit of detail."

            "text": "Neuroscientists use these very unfriendly\nterms to describe different brain regions.So the home of dopamine cells, or\nbrain cells, are called neurons.So the home of dopamine neurons\nare in a part of the brain, sortof what we call the lower midbrain.The dopamine neurons that are part of\nthe reward circuitry are found in thisarea called the ventral tegmental area,\nwhich, I'm sorry to have to use suchtechnical jargon, we call it the VTA.That's the acronym.Andrew Huberman: I think the roof o f\nthe midbrain is the tectum, it meansroof, and the base of the midbrain, it\nmeans floor, which is the tegmentum.So there's a rationale, but it doesn't\nhelp much at all to know the names.Robert Malenka: And, in fact,\nyou are absolutely correct,and I always forget that.So thank you for pointing that out.Andrew Huberman: It's a side\neffect of teaching neuronatomy.Robert Malenka: Which I once did\nback in the early 80s, but I'veforgotten everything I taught.Anyhow, so these dopamine neurons,\nand we can talk about other types ofdopamine neurons, they send messages,\nwhat we call projections, usingtelegraph wires that we call axons.They send projections to many different\nbrain regions, the key one in the brain'sreward circuitry being an area, again,\nwith a very complicated name called thenucleus accumbens, and maybe Andrew.You know, I actually don't know how that\nname evolved, the nucleus accumbens.And I'm sure I should know, because I've\nbeen studying it for 30 years, but I havenever looked up the genesis of that name.Andrew Huberman: Well, the fortunate\nthing about this podcast is it'sboth on audio platforms like Spotify\nand Apple, but also on YouTube.And so now we can be absolutely\nsure that somebody has put it intothe YouTube comments underneath\nthis episode, and thereforeeveryone will learn, including us.Robert Malenka: So I don't know the\norigins of t he word nucleus, and it'sa gross oversimplification, but it's\nthe activity of these dopamine neuronsin the ventral tegmental area that\nthen cause the release of this powerfulneuromodulator, dopamine, in the nucleus\naccumbens, which is part of anotherbrain structure with a tough to remember\nname called the ventral striatum.And then magic happens, and when I say\nmagic happens, even though we've beenstudying how dopamine modifies the\nproperties of cells in this nucleusaccumbens, the truth is, we don't\nhave a deep mechanistic understandingwhy, when dopamine is released in the\nnucleus accumbens, we experience that.As I'm being very cautious here,\nthe simple way would be to sayas highly rewarding, but it's a\nlittle more complicated than that.What it tells us is that there's\nsomething really importanthappening in our environment.Andrew Huberman: So could we say\nthat it cues the arousal system?Robert Malenka: It gets\nthe arousal system going.There're close ties to our memory systems,\nwhich hopefully, intuitively, makessome sense if something really important\nis happening in your environment.Because, again, I think what's helpful\nfor your audience is to always bethinking about how these systems evolved\nfrom an evolutionary perspective.And if dopamine is signaling something\nreally important and salient is happeningin your environment, you want to remember\nthat it could be a highly rewardingexperience, like a source of food for me.I like all donuts, so I don't want\nto emphasize any one manufacturerof one donut versus the other.I like sugar laden, fat laden foods.That's why I never eat them,\nbecause I like them so much.And I use that as an example,\nbut because that was animportant event for my survival.This reward circuitry, yes, it\nstimulates my arousal system.It gets me to pay attention.It also has very close\nties to memory systems.And to go off on a little bit of a\ntangent, I think the one, I don't wantto say it's a mistake, I think perhaps\nsomewhat oversimplification of howpeople conceptualize dopamine's role\nin the brain is, even though it's amajor, important role, is for it to\nbe active and released during highlyreinforcing experiences like sex, like\nreally good food, like drugs of abuse.It also can get activated, subdivisions\nof this system, during painfulstimuli and during aversive stimuli,\nwhich, again, are really importantfor you to be aware of, to say, oh\nmy God, that's really bad for me.So the dopamine system, this reward\ncircuitry and its subcomponentsthat maybe, perhaps signal more\nsalience or aversion in theenvironment, are closely tied to\narousal systems and memory systems.Again, hopefully, for somewhat obvious\nreasons, you want to remember powerfullyreinforcing events in your life, as\nwell as powerfully emotionally orphysically painful events in your life.So I hope I answered your\nquestion to a modest degree.Andrew Huberman: No, far\nbetter than a modest degree.That's an excellent description of the\ndopamine system from a true expert.And the question I have is about\nsome of the context and nuance ofthe system, but in sort of real world\nterms, how should I think about this?"

            "text": "Even in my training as a neuroscientist,\nI know neurons can be a little active,a lot active, everything in between.They can be active over long periods\nof time or short periods of time.But let's use the example of the donut.I like a glazed old fashioned donut.I actually don't have a craving for\nsweet thIngs, but donuts is an exception.I like the glazed old fashioned donut,\nbut if I were to see just a little pieceof a glazed old fashioned donut versus a\nfull glazed old fashioned donut, could Iexpect that more dopamine is released to\nthe anticipation of the complete donut?And then the other question is, how does\ncontext influence the dopamine system?For instance, if I'm very\nfull, a glazed old fashioneddonut might be aversive to me.Whereas if I'm just a little bit hungry,\nor if I'm actually more on a scheduleof rewarding myself for abstaining from\nsweet, fatty foods, then abstaining fromthe food might be its own form of reward.Robert Malenka: Yeah.Andrew Huberman: And so, to me, the\ndopamine system seems incrediblysimple and yet incredibly prone to\nimmediate context and the kinds ofnuance that we're constantly juggling.I'll interrupt myself to say that\nwe're constantly juggling a bunchof different reward contingencies.We want to have good health\nmetrics and maybe have a certainaesthetic qualities to our body,\nbut we also want the doughnut.And so how does a system as simple\nas one neuromodulator system andthe VTA to nucleus accumbens, and\nwith some connections to the memoryarea, how does it balance all of\nthat information in real time?To me, that's just, like, staggeringly\ncomplex, but also incredibly interesting.Robert Malenka: I think you,,, beautifully\nput, very eloquent description.You just said it.It's staggeringly simple,\nsimultaneously staggeringly complex.And you asked several different questions.So context makes an enormous importance.And that's one of the reasons I\nbecame interested in the dopaminereward circuitry is, as you know, as a\ncolleague in the academic neuroscienceworld, but your listeners probably\ndon't, I started out my career studyingvery basic mechanisms of plasticity.How does the brain modify itself?And what makes the brain different\nthan the computer hardware isthe physical connections in the\nbrain are constantly changing thestrength of the communication.Similarly for the dopamine reward\ncircuitry, it's highly plastic andit's highly contextually dependent.And so you gave the example of\ndonuts and feeding, and I'll answeryour question about the cues.Yes, I used to give the example of\nThanksgiving, so let me give that example.In the morning of Thanksgiving, all,\nfor most of us in the United States,the morning of Thanksgiving, if you're\nat home visiting your parents, thesmells of the apple pie, the smells\nof the turkey cooking are highlyrepetitive, highly reinforcing.You're anticipating that fun event.You're anticipating Uncle Joe coming\nto visit you for Thanksgiving.And that's all because these cues, the\nsmells, the anticipation of Uncle Joe,your previous experiences, are part of\nyour memory system, sort of talking to,in a simple way, your reward circuitry.So you're building up this\nanticipation, one could almost saythis craving, which maybe we'll talk\nabout in the context of addiction.And then, make a long story\nshort, think about that eveningat the end of Thanksgiving.Those exact same cues, the exact\nsame smell of the apple pie,turkey, and Uncle Joe himself.At the very least, they're no\nlonger repetitive, meaning theymight actually be aversive.The last thing you want\nis a piece of apple pie.You can't wait for Uncle Joe to\nleave your Thanksgiving dinner.And I always argue that\ndoes not happen magically.That happens because your brain has been\nmodified by the context in which it sits.And this very important modulatory\nsystem, this reward circuitry, isresponding to the exact same stimuli\nwith a very different response.So I'm just telling you, I'm repeating\nwhat you said, the phenomenology.And again, my other favorite example\nis any of us who have been in anintimate relationship knows that the\nlove of your life can turn to thebane of your existence in 20 seconds.And again, that doesn't happen magically.This person who you crave, who you\nlove, does something, and two minuteslater, your brain is saying, oh, my\nGod, I may have to break up with thisperson, or, this is an incredibly\npainful emotional experience, and whatfascinates me about the brain is, how\ndoes the brain mediate that rapid change?So now back to, so, yes, context\nis everything about how thispowerful neuromodule choice\nsystem that uses dopamine works,and the truth is, we don't know.It's because the inputs onto these\ndopamine neurons, the other nervecells that are driving the activity\nof the dopamine neurons, and I'veactually studied this in my lab at\nStanford University with a colleagueyou know well, Lee Chun Luo, who's\na world class neuroscientist.We've studied the complexity of the\nneuroanatomy of the dopamine system,and these dopamine neurons in the\nventral tegmental area, the source ofthe reward circuitry, dopamine, are\nreceiving inputs from all over the brain.They're receiving indirectly\nor directly inputs from visualareas, from somatosensory areas.And I'm not giving you a really good\nanswer because that's one of the goalsof my research, to try to understand\nhow context, how the history thatyou've had with these cues, which we're\ngoing to get back to of the donut orof a drug, how has that modified how\nthis neuromodulatory system responds?Similarly, the nucleus accumbens, the\ntarget of this powerful modulator,dopamine, is receiving communications,\nwhat we call inputs from all sortsof brain regions that you know about.Andrew, your audience may not.It receives inputs from an area called\nthe hippocampus, which you may havecovered in previous podcasts, which\nis very powerfully, very important formemories, both establishing new memories\nand, again, remember, that makes sense.You want this system, this\ndopamine reward circuitry, to bevery connected to memory systems.So the activity in the nucleus\naccumbens is modulated by dopaminewhile it is receiving information from\nthe hippocampus, which helps encodenew memories, while it's receiving\ninformation from a brain area called theamygdala, which is a part of the brain\ninvolved in our emotional experiences.The accumbens also receives\ninputs from the prefrontalcortex, which is this brain area.As you know better than me,\nAndrew, is important for decisionmaking, for planning our activity,\nand I could go on and on.Andrew Huberman: Well, could we talk\nabout prefrontal cortex for a moment,"

            "text": "because it always was surprising to me\nthat prefrontal cortex is talked aboutas this higher executive function area.But then when you look at the\nneuroanatomy, it's, as we say,monosynaptically, as you and I know,\none connection away from structureslike the amygdala, one connection\naway from structures like the nucleusaccumbens . In other words, prefrontal\ncortex, to me, is every bit as ancientas some of these other structures\nthat we think of as more ancient,and really, the whole ancient evolved\nthing gets a little bit dicey becausecertain areas aren't like the prefrontal\ncortex, are more elaborated in humans.But to me, the prefrontal cortex seems\nto be especially important in the contextof this thing of scaling the reward\nresponse, or context of the rewardresponse, because it can set rules.It seems to know, okay, we're recording\na podcast now, and there are certainrules, there are certain things\nthat we're going to do and not do.But what's fascinating about the, and\nI'm so glad you gave a bunch of differentexamples, because what's fascinating, for\ninstance, about the relationship exampleis that, yes, at one moment we can adore\nsomebody, and another moment later, ifthey do something or don't do something,\nwe can be incredibly frustrated with them.They can even become aversive to us.Hopefully, that doesn't\nhappen too frequently.Robert Malenka: Hopefully.Andrew Huberman: But I think we've all\nhad the experience of a doughnut, anevent, or a person actually looking\ndifferent to us from one moment tothe next, hopefully not at random.And so, to me, it seems like the\nprefrontal cortex is uniquely positionedto really say, okay, right now we are\nin a mode of, for lack of a better word,love and loving, like in the verb tense of\nloving, be in the verb tense of arguing.We're now arguing.We're in the verb tense of reconciliation,\nkind of somewhere in between orsomething of that sort, and how a\nstructure in a circuit as simple asthe dopamine system, one molecule\ncould suddenly say, oh, you know what?Now getting over my anger is rewarding.Whereas five minutes ago, being right\nand being the most angry was rewarding,and then five minutes before that,\nagain, we're accelerating this movie,but five minutes or five days or five\nyears before that, this person coulddo no wrong, and the dopamine system\nis just cranking out dopamine, saying,whatever you do, I'm just delighted by it.Incredible.Like, to me, I can't think of a more\ninteresting system in neuroscience.Robert Malenka: Well, I mean,\nthat was eloquently put.I agree with pretty much\neverything you said.I don't have much to add, because what\nyou're pointing out is the challengesof studying these systems, the\nimportance of studying these systems,and the challenge of presenting how the\nbrain works to this podcast audience.Because on the one hand, you have\ndone a fantastic job over the lastfew years in your podcast of making\ncomplex subjects accessible to a layaudience and get them to be thinking\nabout how our modern view of how thebrain works could be used to enhance\nhealth, could enhance mental well being.But as neuroscientists, academic\nneuroscientists ourselves, we know,you know, you are oversimplifying\nthings, and the actual functioningof a system like the dopamine reward\ncircuitry, as you just eloquentlypointed out, is so much more complex.It's modified by these prefrontal inputs,\nwhich are simultaneously telling ourmemory systems, pay attention here.I'm repeating what you just said.The context makes a big difference,\nthe history you have with the person orstimuli with whom you're interacting.Like to bring this back to your which\nI never - the initial question - doesa small piece of a doughnut activate\nthe cue that, that small piece of adonut activate the reward circuitry\nand cause release of dopamine tothe same extent as the full donut?Depends on your experience with donuts.I think for you and me, because we seem\nto both like donuts, they're highlyrepetitive for us, probably doesn't\nmatter, because we have learned evena little piece of a doughnut activates\nall of our memory system, saying, man,that's an old fashioned glazed donut.I want to eat that.I want to get one, or I want to\nhave the discipline not to eat it.So I hope I'm answering your question,\nand I'm shifting topics completely.But that's why addiction\nis so challenging.Well, let's talk about that.Andrew Huberman: Let's talk about\nthat, because you've done a ton of"

            "text": "important work in this area of addiction.I mean, one of the basic questions\nI have about addiction know we hearthat certain drugs are more addicting\nthan other drugs or certain behaviors.We also hear that we can\nbecome addicted to anything.When Anna Lemke was on this\npodcast, I said, what's the mostunusual addiction you've ever seen?And she talked about a patient who sadly\ncommitted suicide at some point laterthat she told us had been addicted to\nwater, to drinking of any kind, firstalcohol, but then water eventually.So my question about addiction\nin the dopamine system is,let's pick a drug like cocaine.I've never done cocaine, but\npeople who have done cocainetell me that it feels very good.And one of the more salient features of\nthe cocaine high is that it comes on veryfast, and it ends pretty quickly, too.Is the rate of dopamine increase\nrelated to the addictive propertyof a drug or behavior as much as\nhow much dopamine is released?Robert Malenka: And that's a\nvery sophisticated question,and the answer is yes.And that's usually the lecture I give,\nthe way I think about addiction, andobviously my friend and colleague\nAnna Lemke is one of the world'sexperts in terms of the understanding\nthe human experience of addiction.I have studied it as a cellular molecular\nneuroscientist trying to understandhow addictive substances modify reward\ncircuitry, modify the connectionsin the reward circuitry, modify how\ndopamine neurons act, and the way,like any, what appears to be a simple\nterm, it's layered with complexity.Addiction is somewhat of a continuum.And I like to think about whether\nyou're talking about substances likecocaine, and I will explicitly answer\nyour question soon, or opioids.As you know, we're going in this\ncountry, there is an opioid epidemic.I do like to think about addictive\nliability, and in my view, it ispretty clear that when we're talking\nabout drugs, they have differentdegrees of addictive liability.I mean, I had a cup of coffee this\nmorning, and many of us listening to thispodcast, it's really hard to start our\nday without getting that hit of caffeine.But are we addicted to caffeine?That's a tricky question, because\nI've never heard of anybody robbinga bank to get caffeine, destroying\ntheir personal life to get caffeine.So I would say caffeine causes\ntolerance, but I would not say it has aparticularly high addictive liability,\nwhereas drugs like psychosimulants,like cocaine or opioids, have a\nvery high addictive liability.So, to answer your mechanistic question,\nthere have been some famous studiesdone by the director of the National\nInstitute on Drug Abuse, Nora Volkow.Simultaneously, there have been\nstudies in animal models ofaddiction where you nailed it.In a rough way, the addictive liability\nof a substance is directly correlatedwith two aspects of dopamine.How much dopamine is released in\nthe accumbens and the kineticsof the dopamine release.As you said, how rapidly it's released.To get a little technical, even with\na drug like cocaine or opioids, it'snot only the drug itself, it's the\nroute of administration, because theroot of administration influences the\nkinetics, meaning how fast that druggets into your brain influences the\nreward circuitry and how fast it causesa big, rapid release of dopamine.And some of your podcast listeners may\nbe old enough to remember the crackcocaine epidemic or free base cocaine.And cocaine does have, like\nmethamphetamine, a veryhigh addictive liability.I give lectures to students at Stanford\nabout neurobiology of addictionas part of a team taught course.I have kids who I had to deal with,\nand what I always say is, it's notthat if you use this drug, you're\nautomatically going to become anaddict, but you're taking that risk.And it is impossible to become\naddicted to a substance if you'venever used it, by definition, but\nback to the root of administration.So I went off--Andrew Huberman: --That's actually\nan interesting statement, because Ithink we may have heard that in high\nschool, although I, to be honest,wasn't the most attentive high\nschool student, and I regret thathigh school students, pay attention!Robert Malenka: You did okay for yourself.[LAUGHS]Andrew Huberman: Eventually I came\naround, but it was an uphill battle.But that you can't become addicted to\nsomething that you've never done, whichI just want to earmark that because\nI think it's a profound statement,because it points to the importance of\nthe memory system, but also plasticity.And so I want to make sure that\neventually we get around to talkingabout how the amount of dopamine\nreleased and the kinetics, howthat might influence plasticity.Robert Malenka: Absolutely.Andrew Huberman: What I'm asking here,\nqueuing up in the back of your mind,is whether or not addiction is just\nrelated to the sensation that we havewhen we indulge in a behavior, or\nwhen we are under the influence of adrug, or whether or not it actually\nmodifies neural circuitry in a waythat makes a broader range of drugs\nor experiences attractive to us.Robert Malenka: It's\nprobably the latter, but.So let me get back, and I will answer that\nin a second to the point I was making.So it's not only the substance,\nit's the route of administration.As I said, you can't develop a problem\nwith a substance and develop a substanceabuse problem if you never take it.But snorting cocaine is a\ndifferent experience thansmoking it or injecting it.And one of the reasons the crack cocaine\nepidemic was so powerful, is it gets intowhen you're smoking it or injecting it.And people do this now with\nmethamphetamine, I mean,meth addicts, most of them.And that is another\nepidemic in our country.Most of them smoke it.And the danger of that is the drug,\nwhether it's cocaine, methamphetamine,gets into your brain almost\ninstantaneously, causes a very rapid,powerful surge of dopamine in the\naccumbens in this reward circuitry.And that the feeling you get, which,\nand we're going to get into this, isnot necessarily a happy feeling, and\nit can last for tens of seconds or afew minutes, and it's a feeling that\ngives you this overwhelming compulsionand urge, I want to do it again.Even though it may not actually feel\nall that good, and again, this getsinto we didn't have an addiction problem\nfor any substance other than alcohol,for most of humanity's existence,\nbecause these substances like cocaine,methamphetamine, synthetic opioids\nlike fentanyl, they didn't exist.And the truth is, our brains\nare not designed to handle thosekinds of very powerful substances.Andrew Huberman: As many of you know,\nI've been taking AG1 daily since 2012."

            "text": "You asked a question about the neural\nmechanisms of what we call addiction.Andrew Huberman: Yeah, I'd\nlike to know about the role ofneuroplasticity and addiction.I do want to highlight something\nyou said, and I apologize forinterrupting a moment ago.And then I refrained, but it was an\ninterruption based on real excitementbecause a person I know quite well, who\nis a recovered cocaine addict, told me.And that, by the way, folks,\nthis isn't, I have a friendand I'm actually, you know...I truly have never tried cocaine.And this person said that the first time\nthey did cocaine, his thought was, I hatethis, and I can't wait to do it again.And that's exactly how you described it.Robert Malenka: And I think that is a\nfairly common experience with peoplesuffering from an addiction disorder.We're not supposed to use the\nword addicts anymore becausethat's a little bit judgmental.Andrew Huberman: That's\nthe new nomenclature.Robert Malenka: Something\nalong those lines.Andrew Huberman: Got it.Calling someone an addict as\nopposed to being addicted.Robert Malenka: Yeah, being.And that is a beautiful description.I hate it, but I want to\ndo it again and again.It just shows the power of this system,\nwhich, remember, evolved for our survival.So a very simple way of thinking\nabout it is these drugs are trickingthe reward circuitry to say, this\nstimulus, this experience, isreally important for my survival.I have to go do it again\nand again and again.A side question is, the huge question\nis, why do some people develop anaddiction problem and others who\nhave used this substance just don't?And again, as a world class neuroscientist\nyourself, you know the answer.It's always a complex combination of\nunderlying genetics, the environmentin which they find themselves, the\nenvironment in which they grew up, andhow that modified their reward circuitry.So, to get at your question, one set\nof experiments my lab did, which otherlabs did, too, I don't deserve the sole\ncredit for this, is showing that drugsof abuse cause powerful plasticity\nin the neurons that make up the cellsthat make up the reward circuitry.And in fact, drugs of abuse, like\ncocaine, methamphetamine, opioids likemorphine, heroin, change the synapses.The synapses are the connections from\nother nerve cells onto dopamine neurons,onto the nerve cells and the accumbens.And these connections,\nthese synapses, can change.And drugs of abuse cause powerful\nchanges in those connections, andtherefore, powerful changes in the\nactivity of the dopamine neurons andthe neurons in the nucleus accumbens.And, in fact, the types of changes that\noccur appear to be similar to the typesof changes that have evolved for good uses\nfor adaptive forms of learning and memory.So, again, this is an example that\nthis superficially simple dopaminereward circuitry is changing all\nthe time, and it's highly plasticand can become more sensitive to\ncertain experiences, etc, etc.Andrew Huberman: Well, could\nI ask a question about someof the general contours of the\nplasticity and the dopamine system?You said before, and I love this\nstatement, even though it's verysimple, but in its simplicity, it's\nreally elegant that we can't becomeaddicted to a substance or a behavior\nthat we haven't taken or partaken in.So is there data to support the idea\nthat just one exposure to cocaine or oneexposure to some sort of behavior can\nlead to a lasting change in the dopaminesystem, such that one's propensity to be\naddicted to that substance again, if onewere to indulge in the future, or behavior\nagain in the future, is increased?And I have a very particular\nreason for asking this, but I'mvery curious what the answer is.Robert Malenka: I mean, in the work my lab\nand other labs have done in preclinicalrodent models, the answer is yes.A single administration of a drug of\nabuse, like cocaine, like morphine, cancause relatively several days, several\nweeks of changes in the connections ontodopamine neurons and onto the neurons\nin the nucleus accumbens those changes.That does not mean these changes\nare permanent or irreversible,but the changes last a long time.And again, the big question for\nunderstanding the neurobiologyof addiction is, those changes\nare probably happening inmost people who take the drug.In this case, and we can talk about\nother stimuli, non drug stimulithat can become \"addictive.\"Again, why in certain individuals?To be honest, it's not a big deal.Yeah, I did cocaine at this party.It was nice, but I don't feel any\ncraving or urge to do it again.Whereas other individuals, it\nsets them down a very bad path andreally badly affects their life.And that's a huge question in the\nresearch field, because obviously,if we could make predictions on which\nindividuals are more susceptible, andnot to get too political here, but\nwhether you become, develop a problemwith addiction, or not is influenced\nby the other parts of your life.Do you have other ways of getting,\nreinforcing stimuli, gettingsatisfaction, having an outlet,\nthat other ways of activatingyour reward or dopamine circuitry?Healthy ways, right?Like, as you have articulated, I think,\nin your podcast, getting exercise.You and I both like to get exercise.I feel really good.Sometimes it's painful during the\nexercise, but afterwards I feel great.Andrew Huberman: Almost the\ninverse of the cocaine response.Robert Malenka: Yeah, the desire.Andrew Huberman: And then I hate\nthis, but I can't wait to do it again.It seems like exercise\nis often the opposite.I hate this, I don't want to do this.And then afterwards, gosh, I always feel\nbetter and I'd be happy to do it again.Robert Malenka: Yes, I like to\nexercise chasing a ball, becausethat gets me off thinking about this\nhurts anyhow, back to addiction.So, yes, these drugs can cause, I don't\nwant to, definitely not permanent,changes from a single exposure.And the types of studies I'm talking about\nwere all done in experimental animals.So how that relates to what happens\nin our brains, in human subjectsbrains is not completely clear,\nbut I think there are parallels.So the changes might last a few days, a\nweek or two, but one can see if somebody,there have been studies done where, in\nan animal model, if you give repeatedadministration of a drug like cocaine, the\nchanges get stronger and they last longer,which is kind of intuitively obvious.But again, the big question is why,\nin human subjects, there are peoplewho can use these substances and not\ndevelop a serious problem, and thereare others where they're very damaging.And then that's why I\nstill make the point.If you're a young person, do\nyou want to take that risk?Is it worth it to have that experience?And that's an individual decision.Andrew Huberman: We've done some podcast\nepisodes about alcohol, cannabis, etc., and there just seem to be a pretty wide\nvariation in people's response to theinformation, I think because there are\npeople out there who, well, I've gotfriends who are recovered alcoholics\nwho will tell me the first drinkthey took, they use language like it\ncombined with the chemistry of my bodyin a way that nothing before ever had.And they felt like it was\nlike this magic elixir, right?That has not been my experience.Robert Malenka: I have heard the\nsame stories, and it's hard for meto relate, because, like you, alcohol\ndoes not have that effect on me.And it's hard to believe that kind\nof immediate response to alcoholis due to the environment in which\nthey grew up, although that canhave an influence that just feels\nalmost more genetically encoded.And there is evidence that issues with\nthe use of alcohol and developing alcoholuse disorder does run in families.And obviously, if it runs in family,\nyou have to worry about how theenvironment of that family influences it.But there's a lot of studies saying\nthere is a genetic component.Maybe, like you, if I have a drink or\ntwo in the afternoon, I just fall asleep,and it does not have that effect on me.And anyone can imagine similar\nthings for other drugs of abuse.There are people who have used\ncocaine, have used methamphetamine,who find it modestly enjoyable, but\nit's not the be all or end all, isn'tthis incredibly powerful experience.And you just talked about, I think, a\nfriend or a colleague who said, I hate it.I hate that, but I want to do it again.And that's fascinating.Andrew Huberman: Yeah.They're now a recovered alcoholic and\ncocaine addict, and they've abstainedfor many years, but still get a little\nbit of a gleam in their eye whenthey talk about alcohol or cocaine\nin a way that I just can't relate to.Robert Malenka: Can I tell you\na little vignette about me?"

            "text": "Which I love to tell.Andrew Huberman: Sure.Robert Malenka: And it gets into how the\nreward circuitry is so closely associatedwith memory systems and how cues associate\nit with powerful experiences, developtheir own reinforcing or aversive quality.So, long story short, when I was a\nyoung kid, I can't remember in my20s, maybe 20, I spent a few weeks in\nParis, I started smoking cigarettes.I mean, this is a long time ago,\nand cigarettes are very interesting.Nicotine is highly addictive, as the\ntobacco companies were fully aware of.Andrew Huberman: High addictive liability.Robert Malenka: Very\nhigh addictive liability.Andrew Huberman: People will rob\npeople for the money to buy cigarettes.Robert Malenka: They may not rob\nbecause, although my understandingis they've become quite expensive,\nbut counterfeit cigarettes are ahuge market for organized crime.There are parts in the world,\nthird World countries, whereorganized crime produce counterfeit\ncigarettes and are making hundredsof millions or billions of dollars.I think nicotine as it is delivered in\ncigarettes, as you know, I mean, tobaccocompanies put in a lot of work to figure\nout the exact dose of nicotine thatwill make you get that kind of feeling\nthat only lasts for a few minutes,so you want to do it again and again.So we can talk about nicotine.What becomes a problem in a specific\nsociety with addiction is not onlybased on the neurobiological actions.If we're talking still about drugs\nor substances of that substance,it's heavily influenced by the\navailability of the substance.But my little story is, I\nsmoked some cigarettes in Paris.I learned why people like to smoke.It was very satisfying to have\na cigarette in a Parisian cafe.And it's very interesting\nbecause the first few times youinhale tobacco, you get dizzy.It's kind of aversive, and it's\nexactly what you articulated.Despite that, you want to do it again.So it was just a lot of fun for me.I enjoyed it, and I was disciplined.At some point, whenever this was,\nI came back to the United States.I didn't smoke because I\nknew it was bad for you.But to this day, 40 years later, every\ntime I go back to Paris, I get cravings.I actually just want to\nget a pack of cigarettes.I want to have that feeling\nagain of inhaling the smoke.But the point is of how powerful\nthese rewarding experiences canbe, or reinforcing experiences.And for your audience, technically, what I\nhave been taught by some of my psychologycolleagues is we use the term reinforcing\nin a very behaviorally defined way.Something is reinforcing is if the\nbehavior that led to that stimuli, itmakes you want to do that behavior.Again, rewarding means\nit actually felt \"good.\"Andrew Huberman: That's\nan important distinction.Robert Malenka: They\nactually can be different.Again, as you defined by your friend who\nhis, I forget, I think it was cocaine.Cocaine was highly reinforcing, but it was\nnot necessarily enjoyable or rewarding.And isn't that fascinating?I have some colleagues\nin the addiction field.One of them is retired now, Kent\nBarridge and Terry Robinson.They distinguish between the\nterms wanting and liking.And think about that.Liking something means it's\nsomething you like, you enjoy.Wanting means you want it, but you\ndon't necessarily like it or enjoy it.And that's a description of your\nfriend's experience with cocaine.Some of us have been in destructive\nrelationships where you want thatindividual, but you're not sure you\nnecessarily like that individual.Andrew Huberman: Sometimes people\nwill be in relationships where theyactively dislike the other person,\nwhich is a bit foreign of a conceptto me, but, well, it's interesting.This separation of reinforcing\nand rewarding wanting and liking,because one of the things that's\nvery prominent in twelve stepprograms is to create rewards around\nabstaining from the drug or behavior.And I should mention that programs\nlike twelve step, when followed,seem to have very high success rates.At least that's what Ana Lemke\ntells me, that in some ways they aremodifying the wanting and liking.They're splitting the wanting and liking\nof alcohol, for instance, creatinga liking of sobriety more than the\nwanting of alcohol, for instance.Robert Malenka: That's beautifully put.And I think that's right.How that plays out in the\nneural mechanisms that, as aneuroscientist, I'm interested.Man, that's a tough one,\nbut I think that's why thoseprograms are pretty successful.It's helping the person\nmake those dissociations.And I don't know that much about\nthose programs because I havenot seen patients myself for\nwhatever it's been, 27, 28 years.But I think part of them are to\nhelp that individual find, bothother sources of liking and reward,\ngetting some satisfaction and rewardfrom the actual abstinence, being\nable to cognitively teach themselvesthat I deserve a pat on the back.I deserve credit.I feel good that I did not take\na drink at that party that I didnot use that substance again.And how that plays out in our\nbrains is a really tough one.Andrew Huberman: Yeah, the way\nyou described it is exactly right.Those programs are highly reinforcing for\nabstinence behaviors, everything from thesocial connection, which we're going to\nget to social connection, as you know, tothe way that people start to conceptualize\ntheir addict self versus other self.It actually involves a splitting\nof the self in interesting ways.As long as we're talking about\ndonuts, cigarettes, alcohol, cocaine.I'm curious, before we move to a bit\nmore on neuroplasticity, is thereanything that people ought to know about\nhow different substances and behaviorsthat are addicting might impact the\ndopamine reward circuitry differently?So, for instance, we talked about\ncocaine as having this very rapidonset, big increase in dopamine, then\na crash, as we know, a certain patternof kinetics, as you describe it, the\nopioid crisis is incredibly seriousproblem right now, as is methamphetamine.But it sounds like methamphetamine\nfunctions a bit like cocaine.And in terms of its kinetics, yes.So an opioid is a very different\nchemical than cocaine, but it soundslike it impacts the dopamine system.Is the dopaminergic activity caused\nby opioids responsible for theaddictive properties of opioids?Or do people also like the\nfeeling of being under opioids?I personally hate it\ncoming out of surgery.Like, they gave me Vicodin\nonce and I hated it.I'd rather have the pain, the\npostoperative pain, than takesomething like Vicodin or a Valium\nor fentanyl or anything like that,to me, is just completely aversive.But I realize that there are many millions\nof people that feel quite differently.Robert Malenka: It's a great question.So I think all the studies, both in human\nbeings and preclinical animal models, yes,would suggest that the addictive liability\nof opioids and psychostimulants, whichare cocaine and methamphetamine, have the\ncommon final action of causing massiverelease of dopamine in this target of the\ndopamine neurons, the nucleus accumbens.They do it, if we want to get a\nlittle scientifically technicalhere, via very different mechanisms.So cocaine and methamphetamine, what\nthe drugs known as psychostimulants,actually bind to a protein in the\nbrain, or a molecule in the brainthat is responsible for sucking up.It's a vacuum cleaner sucking up the\ndopamine after it's been released.And cocaine prevents that\ndopamine from being vacuumed up.So the cocaine hangs around longer.Meth not only prevents the\ndopamine from being vacuumed up,it actually causes the reverse.It actually causes the direct\nrelease of dopamine from what wecall nerve terminals, from the\nsite where dopamine is released.Opioids work very differently.They actually primarily, not solely\nwork where the dopamine neurons live.And it's a little complicated,\nit's not that critical, but theyindirectly increase the activity\nwithin the dopamine neurons themselves,causing a big, massive, bigger\nthan normal release of dopamine.So that's one commonality.But anybody who has used these\ndrugs or read about these drugs,the subjective experience of the\ndrugs are dramatically different,and that's because of the actions\nthey're having, not only in the rewardcircuitry, but throughout the brain.And it's interesting,\nyou talked about Vicodin.I've taken Vicodin because I've had\nseveral knee surgeries and things.Like you, I didn't like it.I've gotten other opioids for\npain relief that were great.I mean, they took away a lot of\npain after my ligament repair.And that's a different question, that\neven when you're talking about opioids,all drugs, they're not identical.Fentanyl has a much big, larger addictive\nliability because of its molecularproperties and how it's interacting\nwith the opioid system in our brainsand the receptors, the actual proteins\nin the brain that it interacts with.But the subjective experience\nof opioids, it's interesting.Some people love it.If we go back in history, as you know,\nthere were the opium dens throughout Asia.There were wars about opioids, the\nfamous opioid wars between Chinaand the United Kingdom, showing you\nhow powerful the availability ofa substance like an opioid can be.So I'm going off on a tangent.Andrew Huberman: No, I\nthink these are important.Robert Malenka: But commonality is\ndopamine release in the, if you rememberwhat a ven diagram is, these drugs have\nsome common actions, usually on, directlyor indirectly, causing the massive\nrelease of dopamine in the accumbens.But then they have their own\nindividual actions, becauseobviously, when you take cocaine or\nmethamphetamine, it's a stimulator.People are grinding their\nteeth, they're hyped up.For most people, opioids are the\nexact opposite in opium dens.From the movies I watched and\nwatching narcos and all those TVshows, you're lying down, you're\nkind of in almost a dreamlike state.So very different subjective experiences.Andrew Huberman: I'd like to just\ntake a brief break and thank one"

it.Robert Malenka: I started out in sleep\nresearch, so I have a fondness for it.Andrew Huberman: Well, drug research\nand sleep research have a long historyof overlap with Alan Hobson's work on--Robert Malenka: --I\nworked with Alan Hobson.Andrew Huberman: Okay, by the way,\nfolks, if you're interested in therelationship between hallucinations\nand dreaming, Alan Hobson is a goodname to start your rabbit hole.Robert Malenka: Oh, my God.I'm dating myself.I can't remember if it was\n'76 or '77, I worked with AlanHobson as an u ndergraduate---- At Harvard Medical School----No, as an undergraduate at Harvard.He was at Harvard Medical School.Yeah.Andrew Huberman: Amazing.I love his writing, and\nI learned a lot from it.He was really ahead of his time.Robert Malenka: Yes, he was.Anybody who knows me won't believe\nthis, but back then, I was avery shy, insecure 20 year old--Andrew Huberman: --I\nwould not have guessed--Robert Malenka: --who, even in\nmedical school, I literally was notconfident of my opinions at all.I was very shy, thought all of the\nideas I had must be obvious thatI should never say them out loud.Andrew Huberman: Do you mind if\nI ask, since you raised this,I think it's really important.I mean, you have this\nincredible career track record.You're adored by your colleagues,\nyou're highly respected, you'vewon just about every award there\nis to winning neuroscience.So was there something in particular\nthat, was it an overnight thing whereone day you woke up and thought,\nI actually believe in myself?But if you wouldn't mind sharing\nthat, because I think before weget back into some of the science.Science is a human endeavor, and\nmost people listening are probablynot scientists, but I think\neverybody deals with these issuesof self-doubt, and people appear to\nhave varying levels of confidence.But what happened?Robert Malenka: Thank you for asking.For me, it was a very gradual process.And as an undergraduate, as a medical\nstudent, even as a postdoc, yeah, Iwas very unsure of my ideas, of my\nintellectual abilities, of whether whatI was thinking was really worthwhile.So it was a very gradual process, I think.The increase in my confidence, I\nthink, began when I was a postdoc,which is a training period after\nyou've received a PhD or an MD, whereyou get additional research training.And I worked with a guy named\nRoger Nicoll at UCSF, andRoger was a very intellectually\nintense, very forceful individual.And I got involved in a field where, I\nmean, people, a little bit of a tangent,your listeners may think that scientists\nare these geeky individuals wearing whitecoats with no passion or emotion, and\nnothing could be further from the truth.The most successful scientists I know\nare pretty passionate and pretty intenseabout what they're working on and driven.And this is a gross generalization.So, anyhow, during my postdoc, I\nstarted getting involved in a topicwhere there were vigorous arguments\nabout phenomenology we were studying.So I had to develop a\ntougher and thicker skin.I had to be able to argue my side of\nthe hypotheses we were generating.So it started developing as a\npostdoc, and then it slowly evolved.As an assistant professor, and for your\nlisteners who don't know, I don't like toadmit this, but I'm in my late sixties.I have been running my own\nlab for almost 40 years.So gradually, as an assistant professor,\nI realized, hey, I can do this.I can do science.I can write papers that my\ncolleagues seem to be interested in.And then gradually, over then\nthe next 10, 20, 30 years, Igained more and more confidence.So for me, it was this very gradual build\nup of many different experiences whereI developed some confidence that not all\nof my ideas are great, of course they'renot, but it's okay to voice my opinion.It's okay to state my ideas and why I\nbelieve this and why I don't believe that.So that was my experience.Andrew Huberman: Thank you for\nsharing that, because I think peoplestruggle with that very issue.And clearly, showing up again and again\nover a long period of time is helpful.But as you said, learning to trust\none's ideas, just a brief anecdotewhen I was coming up in neuroscience,\na few years behind you, 20 yearsbehind me, not too many decades.But I recall the incredible number of high\nprofile papers on neuroplasticity and longterm potentiation, long term depression.These are terms related to the\nmodification of synapses that RobMalenka and Roger Nicoll pioneered.A big segment of that work.And I remember seeing your\nnames on papers, and Ithought Roger worked for you.Sorry, Roger.[LAUGHS]Robert Malenka: I love to hear that.[LAUGHS]Andrew Huberman: I was under the\nimpression he worked for you.And only later did I learn\nthat you were his postdoc.Robert Malenka: And then\nwe collaborated as equals.Andrew Huberman: You\nbecame peers very quickly.Robert Malenka: Very quickly.Andrew

            "text": "Andrew Huberman: I'd like to discuss\none aspect of reward circuitry that Idon't think most people think about.It's fairly straightforward nowadays.I like to think more people know what\ndopamine is and understand it, thanksto your work and Anna's work and some\ndiscussions that have taken placeon our podcast and other podcasts.But all too often we think dopamine,\nreward, wanting, liking drugs.Okay, all of that is great, but what\nabout the truly adaptive stuff, right?Because it's easy to fall into\na discussion around dopamine ofthe things that are bad for us.But what I'm thinking about\nhere is social interaction.Clearly, we are a social species, and\na lot of your work in the last decadeand a half or so has focused on the\nrelationship between the reward circuitry,which you beautifully described for us,\nand social interaction and connection.And where I'm going with this is\nultimately, this has huge implicationsfor autism and autism spectrum disorders.I don't know if, nowadays, is it okay?You're not supposed to call\nautism a disease, is that right?You hear about neurotypical and neuro\natypical, but I have friends who havechildren who are severely autistic.And I don't know many parents who would\nelect to have a severely autistic kid.And so those people often will talk about\nit as autism or a child having autism.So first of all, before we get into\nthe social piece, maybe because Ijust tabled it, how are we supposed\nto talk about autism nowadays?Robert Malenka: I am very interested in\nthe pathophysiology of what the medicalprofession terms autism spectrum disorder.As you pointed out, individuals living\nwith an autism spectrum disorderare quite heterogeneous, and it can\nrange from individuals with severeintellectual impairment and quite severe\nimpairments in social interactions,impairments in sensory processing,\nimpairments in lots of different aspectsof our behaviors that are important.And I think nobody would say, would argue,\nthose individuals on the severe spectrumdo not have some sort of \"disorder.\"The issue we have to be sensitive\nto is it's a heterogeneous disorder.Like many brain issues that psychiatrists\ndeal with, like depression, likeobsessive compulsive disorder, like\nvarious anxiety disorders, it'salways on a continuum and a spectrum.So for autism spectrum disorder, there\nare individuals who are high functioningwho, one could argue, have a different\nstyle of interacting socially, may havea different way of processing sensory\ninformation, but who would prefer notto be viewed as having an illness,\nbut rather would be viewed as having adifferent style of living and interaction.And I think we need to respect that.So the challenge is, again, not\noversimplifying a complex heterogeneousdisorder and both being respectful\nof the people who don't want to bedefined as having a neuropsychiatric\nor brain disorder, while equally beingrespectful of people like your friends\nwith severely impaired children whodeserve help, who deserve research.And it's a tough one, because my\nunderstanding from, to be honest, justreading articles in the lay press and\ngoing to websites from organizations thatphilanthropically support research related\nto autism, within that community ofindividuals who are not researchers, but\nwho have family members or are themselvesdealing with some degree of autism\nspectrum disorder, there's disagreementsabout what terminology to use, how to\ndeal with them, and it's complicated.I think we just have to respect everybody.And if you're interacting with\nindividuals, I think it's appropriate.What do you prefer?I do know as a medical professional,\nand especially when you're dealingwith children, there are children\nwho need help and we're not doingthem a service by saying they don't\nhave an issue that we should behelping them with and working on.So I hope that answers\nyour question beautifully.Andrew Huberman: I think it beautifully\nanswers it and encompasses allsides so that we can move forward.So as we use the term autism or\nchildren or people with autism,that's what we're referring to.Robert Malenka: I think people are very\nsensitive, especially those individualswho are neuro atypical, who previously\nmight be diagnosed as autism spectrumdisorder, but would prefer to not be\nlabeled as having a brain illness.That's fine.Once you are an adult, you can\nmake that decision for yourself.Andrew Huberman: We certainly have\ncolleagues at Stanford and elsewhere who,at least by my non clinical assessment,\nseem to fall somewhere on that spectrum.Robert Malenka: And\nagain, it's a continuum.Just as the experience of\ndepression is a continuum.Andrew Huberman: As with depression, you\nwouldn't love a child or an adult anyless because they have depression, nor\nwould you love a child or an adult anyless because of expression of some autism.Robert Malenka: I know the point, we are\nbeing trained in the medical professionto be very, and our society is going\nthis way too, very careful with the termswe use and the labeling of individuals.So I've been taught you can\nsay individuals living withan autism spectrum disorder.Some people don't like using\nthe term, oh, that individual isautistic, because that can have\nsome, I don't want to say derogatorymeaning, but some labeling kind of.But sometimes this gets out of\ncontrol, too, as we both know.Andrew Huberman: Well, for sake of\nfluid conversation, we will do ourbest, but we will acknowledge from the\noutset that we are well meaning but farfrom perfect in how we'll handle this.Robert Malenka: Well put.Well put.Andrew Huberman: So, in thinking about\nsocial interactions and leaving aside"

            "text": "anything related to autism, for the\nmoment, it appears that the circuits inthe brain that mediate the desire to spend\ntime with others of the same species,maybe even with other species like a\ndog, are fairly hardwired but modifiable.We were born with the capacity\nto build them up and that socialbehavior is highly rewarded.Is it rewarded through\nthe dopamine system?And what, if any, involvement is\nthere of the serotonergic system?And we haven't talked about\nserotonin yet, but I'd love tobring up serotonin at this point.Maybe you could educate us a little\nbit about serotonin, because,gosh, if dopamine is fascinating,\nserotonin is at least as incredible.Robert Malenka: Yeah, great question.So I think for me, the easiest way\nfor me to answer it is, actuallyjust tell you, my research history\nand how a lab like mine at Stanfordthat at one point was studying what\nyou and I would call fairly hardcoremolecular mechanisms of neuroplasticity.How do connections between nerve cells\nchange and what molecules are changing?And pretty hardcore molecular stuff.How did I end up studying\nsocial behaviors in mice?And what I hope we'll end up talking\nabout, even developing behavioral modelsof what I will define as empathy in mice.The answer is very simple.My lab was working on roles of classic\ndopamine reward circuitry and howit changes in models of addiction.We haven't talked about depression\nmodels of depression, because justintuitively, hopefully, your listeners\ncan understand if one component ofdepression is what we call anhedonia,\nthe inability to experience reward.Eating a donut is no longer satisfying.Having sex is no longer that much fun,\nwhich is a component of depression.If there's a mechanism in the brain\nthat tells you something is rewarding,by definition, that's not functioning\nnormally in severe depression.So we were doing models of\ndepression to figure out how thedopamine reward circuitry was\nchanging, as were many other labs.We were studying addiction.Those were the obvious ones.And, I mean, it might be entertaining\nto your audience to learn howacademic scientists think.I was thinking, those\nare fascinating topics.They're pretty competitive.Lots of other labs were working on it.And I started thinking what\nother experiences might bemodifying the reward circuitry.I actually made some attempts to look at\nfeeding behavior, but we actually neverpursued that for a variety of reasons.And that's obviously important\nbecause there is an obesityepidemic in this country.And we can talk about how the reward\ncircuitry and some of the things we'velearned from our studies of addiction\nmay be helpful to understanding obesity.But back to social interaction.I started thinking, well, for most\nof us, what I call a pro social, nonsexual experience is highly reinforcing.Andrew, you're a pretty social guy.I'm a pretty social guy.Most of the time, I'd rather\ngo to a movie, a sportingevent, a dinner with friends.Actually, for me, the most meaningful\ncomponent of my life, other thanspending time with my children, is\nspending time with my close friends.And I started thinking, well, why is that?Why do I have such a good time\ngoing to a ball game with my bestfriend or going out to dinner with\nanother couple and interacting?It's because, well,\nit's highly reinforcing.And if it's highly reinforcing, it\nmust involve the reward circuitry.And then I started thinking,\nevolutionarily, it makes a lot ofsense, because if you are part of\na social species, there's a lot ofadvantages for your survival to be\nhanging out with other members ofyour species in a non aggressive way.It can increase your likelihood\nto find a mate and reproduce.It can protect you from predators.I mean, that's why any of your listeners\nwho ever watch wildlife shows or NationalGeographic shows, there's a reason\nall these animals hang out together.It's for protection from predators.So there are all these reasons.So, about, whenever it was, 13 or 14 years\nago, my lab decided to start looking athow the reward circuitry may play a role\nin what I am going to call positive,pro social, nonaggressive interactions.Another word we use is just sociability.And for a variety of reasons back\nthen, this is at least 13 yearsago, maybe 15 years ago, a postdoc\njoined my lab named Gul Dolen.She's now a professor at Johns Hopkins,\nand she had an interest in oxytocin.And as your listeners know, oxytocin\nis this evolutionarily conservedneuropeptide that's very important\nfor parturition, having a babyborn for milk being produced.And it's gotten a lot of attention\nas a potential love neuropeptide, assomething that is released in our brains\nduring a positive social interaction.There's a well known researcher in\nsocial behavior and bonding researchcalled Larry Young, and he did some\nvery important, now somewhat classicwork studying a species called the\nvole, in particular, the prairie vole.And prairie voles are a species\nwhere they mate for life.It's called pair bonding.So one vole will find another vole.They basically get married, they\nhave kids, and they hang outtogether for the rest of their life.No divorce, no 50% divorce rate.And what Larry elegantly showed in\nearly days, in collaboration with aguy named Tom Insel, who is a famous\nacademic psychiatrist, they showedthat oxytocin action within the nucleus\naccumbens, within this reward circuitry,was required and really important\nfor this monogamous pair bonding.Having said that, there was just a\npaper that called that into question.Andrew Huberman: But there's 30\nyears of research prior to that.I'm glad you brought that up,\nbecause we'll keep this contemporary.And the reality is that that recent\npaper got a lot of attention.Robert Malenka: You know\nthe paper I'm talking about.Andrew Huberman: Yeah.That maybe oxytocin isn't\nplaying as prominent role in pairbonding as people had thought.And yet, folks, that could be true.We have to be scientific\nabout this and be open minded.But there's three decades of\nwork that speaks to the contrary.So I think we want to weigh the evidence.Robert Malenka: Yeah, exactly.And again, the investigators\nwho presented the work sayingoxytocin may not be as important.There are limitations to the manipulations\nthey did, which they would agree with.So I'm just telling you.So, Gul Dolen was a postdoc in my\nlab, and we formulated a projectto look at the actions of oxytocin\nin the nucleus accumbens in mice.And the reason we study mice\nis they're what are known asgenetically tractable organisms.We have all sorts of really cool\nand sophisticated tricks we cando to probe brain circuitry.The actions of neuromodulators like\ndopamine and serotonin and oxytocin inways that we can't do in other species.And I'm going to get back\nto dopamine in a second.And what we found was that oxytocin\naction in the nucleus accumbens was indeedimportant for promoting sociability,\nprobably for promoting the reinforcingcomponent of a social interaction.And that surprised us.It was like, wow, oxytocin seems to\nbe causing, enhancing the release ofserotonin in the nucleus accumbens,\nand that perhaps we'll get to this.That led me off on a whole\nseries of experiments trying tofigure out how serotonin works.Studying this drug we may talk\nabout called MDMA, which isEcstasy, or Molly, which actually\ncauses release of serotonin.So we did that work, and that got us\nworking in serotonin simultaneously.There were some other papers reporting\nthat dopamine release in the accumbens.That dopamine is released in the accumbens\nduring a social interaction, a positive,non aggressive social interaction.Truth be told, it may also be released\nduring an aggressive interaction.Andrew Huberman: Some\npeople like to fight.Robert Malenka: Some people like to fight.And the difference here is\nthe dopamine release and itsrole in social interactions.It's not specific only for a social\ninteraction, as we have talked about,but nevertheless, that led my lab and\nother labs to do a series of papers.I'm talking about the field now\nshowing that, and I'm givingyou a lot of information here.So how might dopamine release happen\nduring a nonaggressive social interaction?It turns out that oxytocin is\nnot only released in the nucleusaccumbens, it's released in the home\nof the dopamine neurons in the VTA.So, my lab and another lab from\nNorthwestern showed that oxytocincan actually modulate dopamine neuron\nactivity in the ventral tegmental area.So I hope I'm making sense here.I don't want to get too technical.Andrew Huberman: No, I think--Robert Malenka: --But it just\nshows how we discuss theseneuromodulators like dopamine.I just brought in oxytocin.We're going to talk about\nserotonin in a second.Unfortunately for your listeners,\nthey don't work in isolation.They influence each other in ways\nthat I think it's important forus to understand and elucidate.Andrew Huberman: That is not\ntoo much technical detail, and"

            "text": "I think it's wonderfully rich\nwith areas for us to discuss.And I'm so very glad that you brought\nup that neither dopamine or serotoninor oxytocin work in isolation,\nbecause all too often, and admittedly,sometimes even on my podcast, I'll talk\nabout these things in isolation as away to try and simplify them a bit.But there's just no way that\nthe brain works that way.For instance, turning on dopamine and\nturning off serotonin, it's a weightingof inputs, and I think that serotonin,\nperhaps I should frame it this way.Just as often as dopamine is framed, as\nthis reward molecule and pleasure anddopamine hits, all too often, I think,\nin the popular press, serotonin isdiscussed, and oxytocin two, for that\nmatter, as this kind of warm, feel good,everything's mellow, not really associated\nwith a reward and reinforcement.And of course, it's not that simple.So when it comes to social\ninteractions, it sounds likeoxytocin and serotonin are playing a\nprominent role also in the accumbens.And that dopamine is activated, too.Do I have that right?Okay, so I don't want to take us too\nfar down the rabbit hole of neuralcircuit function, but that, to me, makes\nat least a brief discussion about thenucleus accumbens itself interesting.Like, okay, so I'm thinking\nnucleus, I know that means a pile ofneurons, an aggregation of neurons.It's talking to this ventral striatum.So we got a bunch of--Robert Malenka: --Part o f the ventral\nstriatum, part of the subdivision.Andrew Huberman: Excuse me, I misspoke.Yeah, it's part of the ventral striatum.And the neurons there can be\nactive and communicate with otherbrain areas, but we're talking\nabout a lot of nuance of function.Robert Malenka: Oh, man, I'm smiling.I don't know if your audience can see\nme smiling, because I sometimes goto bed feeling it's so complicated.Oh, my God, it is.Andrew Huberman: And yet, could\nwe say that within the nucleusaccumbens, there are neurons that are\nacting as accelerators and brakes?Is there a simple analogy that perhaps,\nwhile not exhaustive, can still be true?Because that's always\nthe goal on this podcast.Sure, there's no way we can be exhaustive,\nbut we want to be as accurate as possible.Robert Malenka: So, a very influential\nhypothesis, which has guided my thinking.And again, the trick, you have done a\nwonderful job of communicating complexscientific topics to your podcast\naudience, and I congratulate you onthat, and it's a really important role.But as you know, it's always more\ncomplicated than we want it to be asscientists, especially when you're dealing\nwith brain activity issues and how thebrain mediates all its amazing functions.So, historically, we have thought about\nthe nucleus accumbens and other componentsof this ventral striatal brain area as\nprimarily being composed of two differentcell types, and as you pointed out, one\nbeing sort of an accelerator, somethingthat promotes certain behaviors, and\nthe other cell type somewhat being abreak saying, don't do that behavior,\ndon't perform that motor action.And it is true that there are\nthese different cell types.It is true that they are modulated\nby these modulators like dopamineand serotonin in different ways.And that simplistic hypothesis, or\nheuristic we call it, has been veryuseful in making models about how the\naccumbens does all its wonderful things.What I'm leading up to is, unfortunately,\nit's a little more complicated.But yes, there are two\ndifferent cell types.And at least for your audience, we\ncan think about dopamine driving theactivity of one, promoting certain\nbehaviors and inhibiting the activityof the other cell type, and being a\nsort of break on certain behaviors.As long as you and I, as scientists\nappreciate, it's not quite that simple.It's a little more complicated.Andrew Huberman: So using that as a\nframework to think about social behavior,as you said, pro social, non aggressive,\nnon sexual interactions involve thechoice of a lot of behaviors, but also\nthe suppression of a lot of behaviors.Maybe you're starting to\nsense what I'm doing here.I think for people to understand how a\nsingle structure like the accumbens couldmediate social interaction and reward\nit, what it sounds like it's doing isrewarding a certain category and catalog\nof behavioral options and punishing, orat least reducing the probability of the\noccurrence of other behavioral actions.Because when I go to dinner\nwith friends, if I know themreally well, I might hug them.I might even say something\nmildly inappropriate if I knowthe context to be safe, right?But at a dinner interview or a discussion\nwith somebody I barely know, I might watchmy words a little bit more, for instance.Robert Malenka: And I think the\naccumbens and its associated circuit,I love the way you just put that...Probabilities.It's my probability of\nhaving this behavior in acertain context is increased.The probabilities of not\ndoing certain behaviors.And I think there's little doubt that this\nbrain area called the nucleus accumbensand all of its associated circuitry play\na very important role in what behaviorsyou choose to do, pursue, play a very\nimportant role in these, making thedecision and performing these pro social,\nnon aggressive, non sexual interactions.I actually also think it\nplays a role in empathy.I'm leading you there.I want to have a discussion about that--Andrew Huberman: --Please--Robert Malenka: --Again, as a\nmechanistically driven neuroscientist,what is frustrating for me is I know a\nlot of the connections it's making and theother brain areas it's communicating with.But I can't give you a coherent hypothesis\nor diagram of how it all happens.[LAUGHS]Andrew Huberman: You're still going.[LAUGHS]Robert Malenka: What I can say is, even\nat our current level of understanding,it is leading to novel hypotheses that\nare allowing the development, perhapsif we bring it back to autism, that are\nallowing the development of novel atthe moment, pharmacologic therapeutics\nthat might be helpful for peoplewho are not having normal pro social\ninteractions and would like to havethem, would like to be able to function\nin that domain in a more adaptiveand productive and meaningful way.And that's the importance, in my\nview, of the kind of mechanisticwork my lab and many other labs\naround the country are doing.Even if we don't have a detailed\nunderstanding of how it's allhappening, we can identify drugs and\ndruggable targets, or even behavioralinterventions that might actually\nhelp people, for example, sufferingfrom autism spectrum disorder of the\nsort that they actually want and needinteraction, need therapeutic help.Andrew Huberman: I think looking\nat the social connection circuitrythrough the lens of autism is going\nto be very interesting for us to do.I do have a question about what is\nbeing selected for in rewarding social"

But social media itself is an incredible\nphenomenon to consider in lightof everything we're talking about.Even though I am on all social media\nplatforms and I am quite activethere, I can't say that I've ever\nbeen on social media and experiencedthe kind of delight and thrill and\npersistent energy increase that Iexperience with in-person interaction.And yet social media, I have to\nassume, is capitalizing on someof these same reward mechanisms in\npresumably the nucleus accumbens.So are there any data?I realize this is a hard experiment\nto do in mice, maybe impossible,but are there any data that you're\naware of that shows that socialmedia has a high addictive liability?Or do we even need an experiment?Robert Malenka: I'm not\nsure we need an experiment.I think it clearly does.I agree with the point you're making.Although your podcast audience\nprobably doesn't know who I am.I am in my late sixties.I grew up--Andrew Huberman: --Well,\nthey know who you are now--Robert Malenka: --I grew up before\ncomputers, before cell phones.So I still am a believer,\nperhaps in an old fashionedway, that physical interpersonal\nreactions are really important.Obviously there are advantages to\nbeing able to interact over socialmedia for all sorts of reasons.There's a lot of positive\nand good from that.But back to your question.Can we get addicted?I can't speak to social media.I can speak, and Anna Lemki, I think,\nis much more able to eloquentlydescribe the issues around this.I can just talk from my own experience\nthat my cell phone is and check, you know,this isn't social media, but checking my\nemail messages, checking my texting, mytext messages for me has a compulsive,\naddictive quality, like a lever press.It's like a lever press for a mouse.And part of that is my own personality.Part of that is the immediate feedback.So you get from a social media post,\nfrom seeing your name mentioned, gettinga message from one of your friends.Sure, I like getting\nmessages from my friends.It means they're thinking about me.It means I'm part of their world.I have no doubt it's activating my reward\ncircuitry, not nearly to the degree thata hit of cocaine or an opioid would do.I don't know what else to say about it.I think as a society, we have to be\naware of these issues, and it's reallycomplicated how we manage, especially\nonce you're an adult, you make yourown decisions, for better or worse.But it's a huge issue, obviously,\nfor anybody who has children or isplanning to have children and adults.Andrew Huberman: On social media, I see\nlots of accounts of people that are 18 andolder who spend a lot of time on there.And I'm not necessarily\nsaying that's a bad thing.A lot of people have entire\ncareers that exist on social media.It just seems to me that Instagram,\nFacebook, LinkedIn, Twitter havecapitalized on this hardwired circuitry.I mean, to make it really reductionist,\nthe release of serotonin, dopamine, andoxytocin by virtue of someone saying\nsomething to us, maybe not even a positivething, maybe it's a negative thing.As you said, they're thinking of us.There's something about\nbeing recognized by others.And maybe this is a good segue.We're heading towards empathy here.A discussion about empathy.Robert Malenka: I think\nthat's very well put.It is capitalizing on these more primitive\nneurobiological mechanisms that evolvedfor purposes of reproduction and survival.I think that certainly has to be the case.And I think it's important.I mean, thank you for bringing\nthat up for us as a society,to be at least aware of this.And it's like many things, it's\nnot all good, it's not all bad.There are positive uses of social\nmedia, I can see, but mostly weread about the dangers of it.We read about these kids who are socially\nisolated, who make bad decisions basedon what they're seeing with social media.But anyhow, back to the neuroscience.You're absolutely correct.It's capitalizing on these mechanisms\nthat evolved for physical interpersonalinteractions because our evolution\ndidn't anticipate it, right?Andrew Huberman: Just as\npornography is capitalizing onthe sexual arousal reward circuit.Associated reward--Robert Malenka: --No question about it.Just as the gambling industry does.I mean, as you know, the Vegas casinos\nhave full time people developingalgorithms for how frequently\nshould a slot machine pay off.You know, what's the perfect\namount of payoff to keepcertain individuals coming back?Andrew Huberman: So pernicious.You can tell I've been spending a lot of\ntime around addicts and former addicts.I've been researching some things\nfor the podcast and a gamblingaddict told me something interesting.They said the real stinger with being\na gambling addict is that the next timereally could change everything, whereas no\nalcoholic says that, that the next drinkcould change everything for the better.Or the cocaine addict doesn't think,\noh, the next line of cocaine could makeall of life better now and forever,\nwhereas the gambling addict actuallyholds in mind the infinitesimally\nsmall and yet real potential thatthe next time really could wipe out\ntheir debt and perhaps wipe out...And yet we know they would\nlose that, too, right?Whatever winnings they have.Robert Malenka: And casinos\nare fully aware of this.I have been told by friends who know\nthey employ full time quantitative,for lack of a better term, I\nwas going to say computer geeks.I don't mean that to be derogative.Andrew Huberman: And\nprobably neuroscientists too.Robert Malenka: I would be amazed\nif they don't have neuroscientistswho have expertise in what's called\nneuroeconomics or behavioral economics.I'm 95% sure that has to be the case.Andrew Huberman: I occasionally sit\ndown to the roulette table becauseit\u2019s just so passive and easy.And not long ago, actually, I had the\nexperience of winning, not a largesum, but a meaningful sum of money.Robert Malenka: It's fun.Andrew Huberman: And I'll tell you,\nmy sole mission at that point wasto get up and go back to my room\nand not stop at another table.And I confess I pulled one brief stop\nat another table, played one hand andthen lost it, and then just got back to\nmy room as quickly as possible and thenleft Las Vegas as quickly as possible.Robert Malenka: Yeah, gambling is--Andrew Huberman: --But they'll\nprobably get me the next time--Robert Malenka: --Yeah, gambling\nis, again, it all gets back tothis reward circuitry, and the\nintermittent rewards are very powerful.Andrew Huberman: Well, and you\nmentioned earlier that the rewardsystem is powerfully tuned to remember\nwhat were the behaviors that ledup to the rewarding experience.Nobody ever won at the roulette\nor craps table or poker tableby getting up and leaving.Robert Malenka: Right, exactly.Andrew Huberman: So I guess my brain\nwas just thinking, well, how did I win?I won by sitting down and putting chips on\nthe table, not by going back to my room.Robert Malenka: Exactly.Andrew Huberman: And yet I have a\nfair number of degrees, and I like tothink my prefrontal cortex is working.And yet it was still\nchallenging in that moment.Robert Malenka: Gambling is really another\nhuman activity that's quite complicated.It can be enjoyable or it\ncan be incredibly damaging.Andrew Huberman: And now people are going\nto think I was that gambling addict thatI was referred to, but I swear I'm not.Fortunately, I feel very blessed\nthat that's not my addiction.I'd like to talk about empathy and\nuse that as a framework for eventually"

            "text": "returning to our discussion of autism.But you have this perhaps\nlongstanding interest, but recentresearch interest in empathy.Tell me about this work.I'm not familiar with it.Robert Malenka: Okay.So I hope it's okay to drag in\nsome work I've done on this drugcalled MDMA because it is related.So we were working on, in my lab, social\nbehaviors, positive pro social behaviorsthat stimulated me to start thinking\nabout what are components of a positivepro social, non aggressive interaction.A common key component of that is having\nsome empathy and compassion for theindividuals you're hanging out with.And it is a topic I've been\ninterested in for many, many decades.I was once a psychiatrist, and to get\non my, whatever the word is, hobbyhorse, I look at the world today.I try to be optimistic again.I am a child of the '60s and '70s.When I look at the world, and I actually\njust did a trip to Israel to give aseries of lectures, and I look at the\nIsraeli-Palestinian conflict, whatalways enters my mind, and I've felt\nthis way for decades, is what is moreimportant for the survival of the human\nspecies than empathy and compassion, thanactually being able to look at another\nhuman being, even if they look differentthan you, even if they have a different\nbelief system than you, what is moreimportant than actually understanding\nthat 98% of your life is very similar?You have some differences in how\nyou look and the beliefs you have,but there's so much in common.So what's more important than\nunderstanding that when anotherperson is suffering, their suffering\nis the same as your suffering andhaving compassion for somebody?So I started thinking,\nwhat is more important?And I'm not a politician.As you know, Andrew, I have\nno social media presence.I figured the only way I might be able\nto contribute to efforts that mighthelp the human species enhance empathy\nand compassion is by studying theneurobiological underpinnings of it.And I didn't realize I might be able to do\nthat until I started studying sociabilityor prosocial behaviors in mice.And then I was able to have a\nyoung woman scientist, and I wantto give her credit, Monique Smith.You might want to have\nMonique on your podcast.She's a dynamo.She's now an assistant professor\nat UCSD, where you were.And Monique introduced me to a series\nof behavioral assays that I like to usethe phrase, they are measurements, they\nare behavioral antecedents of empathy.Because in the world of psychologists\nand people who use the termempathy, it has a lot of different\nmeanings to different people.I'm using it basically to mean one member\nof a species manifests some behaviorthat indicates it is being influenced\nby the emotional state, or what wecall the affective state, effective\nwith an \u201ca\u201d of another member of thatspecies in its immediate environment.For human interactions.I just think, we were talking about\nfriendships, any of us who watcha close friend suffer, it's hard.You want to do anything\nyou can to help them.That's empathy.A mother with their child, a good\nmother, hopefully, when you have a kidwho is sick, there's nothing worse.As a parent, you just want to\ntake that pain and suffering away.That's how I'm defining empathy.So it's my belief that like any\ncomplex human behavior, there areevolutionary reasons why that has been\nadaptive and important and maintained.And if it's evolutionarily evolved,\nthere are ways of studying it inmore primitive organisms, like mice.So I'll tell you some of the\nbehavioral assays we're doing.One is, and I get a kick out of this\nbecause it's pretty new for me, soone assay, and we published a paper in\na journal called Science about this,which is if you take one mouse, and\nin an ethical way, you put it in pain,you make its hind paw, one of its paws,\none of its feet hurt a modest amount,and you take another mouse and you let\nthat, what's known as the bystandermouse, just hang out with the mouse\nthat's in pain for 1 hour, just 1 hour.The bystander mouse, who has\nexperienced no physical injurywhatsoever, will manifest behaviors\nindicating it is now in pain.And it lasts maybe four to 20 hours.but think about that.A mouse that is normal hanging\nout with another mouse in painstarts feeling pain itself.Andrew Huberman: And the mice are able\nto see one another and hear one another?Robert Malenka: Good point.So you're getting to how is\nthat communication happening?And a lot more work\nneeds to be done on it.Monique and her previous\ncolleagues and others.One component of it is\nprobably an olfactory cue,or what we call a pheromone.Andrew Huberman: So the mouse that's\nin pain is secreting an odor?.Robert Malenka: Probably, because you can\ntake bedding from mice in pain and exposethe bystander mice, so that's one thing.And I had never heard of\nthese behavioral assays.We developed our, and this is pretty\ncool, and then I'll tell you twoothers, and then I'll tell you how\nit connects to reward circuitry.We developed a novel assay, which is\nthe social transfer of pain relief.Pain relief is called analgesia.And I thought this was pretty cool.And this is in this paper that was\npublished in Science a year ago.You take two mice and they're\nboth in pain, modest pain.I don't want your listeners to get upset.We are not hurting these mice too\nbadly, and it is a tricky issue.Is it okay to put a mouse in\npain so you can, the goal is todevelop better treatments for\nhuman beings in pain, obviously.So you have two mice in modest pain.You give one mouse morphine.So it's now analgesic.It is no longer experiencing pain.You take another mouse that's in pain,\nand you just let it hang out with themouse that is no longer in pain, and the\nmouse that is in pain will show behaviorsindicating it is experiencing analgesia.It is no longer in as much pain.Now think about that, and there's actually\nevidence from human studies that I can'tspeak to in any comprehensive way where\nit's called social buffering of pain.To be honest, I've been having some neck\npain just because I'm an old guy and Iwoke up on the wrong side of the bed.And if I'm by myself, I focus on\nthat pain, and it bothers me more.If I'm socially engaged, I think it's\nnot only that I'm not paying as muchattention to the pain, but I think\nthere's actually some relief from what'sknown as the social buffering of pain.Andrew Huberman: Well, I'm no hippie,\nbut I actually think that all species,including humans, are secreting molecules,\nmainly odorants, that are perhapseven acting directly as analgesics.And I can make that statement without\nworrying too much that people think I'mcompletely crazy because we had Noam\nSobel on the podcast from the Weismanwho shared with us not one, not two,\nbut at least a dozen ways in whichhumans are making molecules, typically\nodors, and communicating those to oneanother to powerfully impact their\ntestosterone levels, their vasopressinlevels, their immune molecules.And of course, Noam works on\nolfaction, so he's going tobe biased toward that system.But that's just one slice\nof the sensory array.What about the way that somebody\ncan look at us in a way that makesus feel good on a normal day?Well, when we're in pain, just even\nthe touch to a shoulder can mean a lot.I remember going to meetings when I was an\nearly neuroscientist, and I would probablyat that point, have not been the type to\njust walk up and say hello to you becauseI wasn't in your field, and you're this\nluminary and stuff, but I remember asI started, I'm a good guy, by the way.You are very good.Robert Malenka: I always\nsay hi to everyone.Andrew Huberman: I know you are.And that statement was a reflection\non me, not a reflection on you.But as I advanced through my career,\nwhat I found was you'd give a talk orsomething, and someone in your field\nmore senior to you, who you respected,would give a nod or something.Those nods meant a lot.Robert Malenka: Absolutely.Andrew Huberman: Those nods\ncould carry you a long distance.I mean, obviously, we want to be\nintrinsically driven to do the work we do,but this social communication that we do--Robert Malenka: --We're a social species--Andrew Huberman: --I think there's\na whole landscape of things.So what you're describing is incredible,\nbut I think makes a ton of sense.Robert Malenka: Yeah.So we have this social transfer, pain\nof analgesia here we're working on, and"

            "text": "there's a little bit of evidence in the\nliterature suggesting this might work.And then I'll talk about reward\ncircuitry and maybe MDMA and is it anempathogen or not, and how that might\ninfluence therapeutic efforts for autism.We're working on behavioral models.We're asking the question, will one mouse\nbehave to give another mouse a reward?So it's the mouse that's behaving\nthat has to press a bar or nosepoke or even experience a shock.Will the mouse do that simply to\ngive one of its buddies a reward?Andrew Huberman: Pure altruism.Robert Malenka: Yeah.We call it generosity, a generosity assay.And early days, it looks\nlike it might be working.And that's a generosity assay.We can also ask the\nquestion, will a mouse work?So another mouse doesn't get a shock,\ndoesn't get hurt, which is compassion.And I think these things\nare going to be working.And whether you want to call that\nempathy, I would call it that.Those are behaviors, I like to use\nthe term behavioral antecedents of howwe define empathy in human beings and\nthe connection to reward circuitry.And the little bit of work we have\ndone on this is we presented evidencethat these behaviors we call the\nsocial transfer of pain, one mouseexperiencing pain just because it's\nhanging out with another mouse.The social transfer of analgesia.A mouse in pain getting some pain relief\nfrom hanging out with another mousein pain, who has that pain relief.It seems to involve one component of\nthe complex brain mechanisms, seemsto involve a part of the brain called\nthe anterior cingulate cortex, whichhuman brain imaging studies suggest is\nactivated during empathic human responses.And the projections of that\narea into the nucleus accumbens.That's the connection.And we're interested in whether\nneuromodulators like dopamine andserotonin may influence this circuitry,\nthese connections that are involvedin these \"empathic\" behaviors, etc., etc . And we think drugs can be\nused as probes of those kindsof neuromodulatory mechanisms.I hope this is all making sense.Andrew Huberman: Makes excellent\nsense, and it's fascinating.I'm not one to suggest experiments\nto colleagues in areas where Idon't work, but I'm going to anyway.Robert Malenka: Yeah, please.Andrew Huberman: One,\nYou're a really smart guy.Robert Malenka: I will\nvalue your suggestions.Andrew Huberman: I love the motivational\nbackbone to what you're describinghere because I agree the world has a\nlot of issues, and what could be moreimportant than to increase the amount\nof empathy and compassion in the world?But one thing that we know inhibits\nempathy and compassion is one'sown challenges and struggles.And so I'm wondering if there's a way to\nintroduce something to this behavioralparadigm such that the working to provide\nanother animal relief from pain, oneanimal working to provide relief of\nanother animal in pain, or an animalworking to provide pleasure reward for\nanother animal if it could be scaledwith how inconvenient that work is.Robert Malenka: Absolutely.Andrew Huberman: If I'm very hungry.I mean, we're all taught to put our own\noxygen mask on first in some way too,so that we don't all die, so to speak.But I grew up, for\ninstance, with one parent.My mother was the kind of person who\nwould see, at that time, there were farfewer homeless people on the street.Maybe they were all\ninstitutionalized, I don't know.But if she saw a homeless person\non the street of the town we livedin, she would literally pull over,\ngive them money, find hotels.She had homeless people living in\nhotels all over the town we lived in.Robert Malenka: Good for her.Andrew Huberman: It was crazy.I mean, we couldn't get anywhere.That was the problem, is we would\nnever arrive anywhere on time.And that's my excuse\nfor always being late.I was positively\nreinforced for being late.I always run late, and I always run...Incredible, right?Just a very strong sense of social,\nfantastic connection, that kind of thing.But in any case, some\npeople are like that.She could not experience any even modicum\nof inconvenience for helping others.Robert Malenka: Good.Andrew Huberman: Whereas I think\nmost of us feel like if I'm rushingto catch a flight and I see someone\nwho's struggling, I'm probably goingto help them if they're in acute pain\nor it seems like a dire circumstance.But let's be honest, most people are\nprobably going to prioritize theirown stress and priorities, for lack\nof a better word, when the situationoften calls for us to set those aside\nand tend to people that are suffering.So if there was a way to introduce\na probe of the interplay ofcircuitries that involve how\nconvenient or inconvenient it is.Robert Malenka: Fantastic.Andrew Huberman: Like if we're well\nfed, it's pretty easy to go out andgather and distribute food for others.But if we're hungry, we tend\nto focus on our own hunger.Robert Malenka: So first, in full\ndisclosure, even though I'm studyingempathy and compassion, I can look in\nthe mirror and say, I probably don'tpractice it nearly as much as I should.I'm thinking of your example.If I was late for a plane, I'm not\nsure I would stop and help somebody.And I'm not saying--Andrew Huberman: --I think it depends\non w hat sort of suffering exactly.If they're hemorrhaging on the side--Robert Malenka: --Of course--Andrew Huberman: --we all would\nof course, but a flat tire, right?You might think, oh goodness,\ndo I have time for this?Robert Malenka: Yeah, exactly.So I'm not proud of that statement.But back to your question.Yes, I think absolutely, we can design\nexperiments where, after we've establishedthe basic phenomenology, then we can\ntake our subject animal or mouse andput it into certain circumstances.If it's hungry itself, will it work\nas hard to give another animal food?I mean, it's a good question because\nI'm not sure what the outcome will be.One could predict it might work harder\nbecause it understands the \"hunger\" more.Andrew Huberman: I love that.Robert Malenka: Or it could be, of\ncourse it's not going to work hard foranother animal to get a food reward\nbecause it's starving itself and itneeds to take care of itself first.It's a great question.We're also asking questions about, do\nyou have to know your buddy mouse, right?Are you more likely to behave in a\ngenerous or compassionate way if yougrew up with that mouse in the way our\nmice grow up in academic environments?And if it's a stranger,\nhow will you behave?How will you behave if you had a\nfight with that mouse previously?And it also matters, did you win\nthe fight or did you lose the fight?Intuitively, as we probably would all\nguess, I'm more likely to help somebodyI defeated in a fight previously, because\nin the hierarchy, I'm the dominant one.I'm probably less likely\nif that person beat me up.So all these are great questions.I think we can study them.I also think there are ways\nwe can study these kinds ofinteractions in human subjects.Not that I am going to do that myself.Andrew Huberman: Someone at Stanford will.[LAUGHS]Robert Malenka: Yeah.So I think there's also an opportunity,\nand I'm happy to discuss howneuromodulators, like in particular\nserotonin, but also perhaps dopamine andoxytocin, may influence the circuitry\nin the brain mechanisms that aremediating what I term empathic behaviors.Andrew Huberman: Let's return to autism."

            "text": "Robert Malenka: All right.Andrew Huberman: Does autism\ninvolve a lack of empathy?Does autism involve a restructuring of the\nreward system around social interactions?Robert Malenka: Maybe.Andrew Huberman: Considering the second\nquestion first, I could imagine, forinstance, that there are variations in\nbrain wiring that would make it suchthat a kid who then becomes an adult\ngets a tremendous amount of rewardfrom, I don't know, math, designing\nmugs, any number of activities.But that through some variation in\nbrain wiring social interaction,spending time with friends is\njust not as socially rewarding.It just doesn't feel good in the\nmoment, doesn't necessarily feelbad, but it's not selected for.And is there any evidence that's the\ncase in children who are classifiedas autistic or having autism?I want to be clear.I am not a world expert on\npathophysiology of individualswith autism spectrum disorder.I have read some of the literature.I do study mouse models of genetically\nbased autism spectrum disorder.Robert Malenka: So the answer is\nyes, there have been imaging studies,and again, so certain members\nof your audience don't get mad,remember our earlier conversation?We made the point that autism spectrum\ndisorder is a highly heterogeneousset of behavioral symptoms with\nwide variation in how these symptomsmanifest in each individual.So we cannot make blanket statements\nthat individuals with autismspectrum disorder are this or that.But there are studies both in human beings\nand mice that suggest that the reinforcingcomponent of a social interaction is much\nless or lacking in our models of autismspectrum disorder and certain individuals.An important point is, is\nthat just genetically wired?Was that because in their early\nexperiences, they weren't able to getthe sensory stimuli that tell them\nthis is a reinforcing social experienceunknown, or at least those are topics\nthat I think are worthy of investigation.Do individuals or mice with\nautism spectrum disorder lackor do not have the capacity or\nthe same experience of empathy?Again, a very complex topic in\nquestion, and it's very likely forsome individuals, the answer is yes,\nmeaning they do lack some of theneural mechanisms that allow them.But that probably doesn't\napply to everybody.I can say in our mouse models of social\ninteractions and our mouse models of\"empathy,\" our mice show deficits and\nthose deficits can be rescued, meaningimproved upon by manipulations of certain\nneuromodulatory systems, in this case,the serotonin system, by giving drugs,\nincluding a drug called MDMA or Ecstasy.So I hope I'm answering your question.I think these are worthwhile\nsubjects for investigation.I think there's a lot of\nvalue in studying them.Andrew Huberman: Let's go back to\nserotonin in the nucleus accumbens.We will get into this in a bit\nmore detail when we discuss MDMA.But I've now spent a lot of time\nwith a recent paper of yours--Robert Malenka: --Really?Which one?Andrew Huberman: The MDMA paper.Robert Malenka: The Boris Heifets one?Andrew Huberman: Yeah, that parsed\nthe relative roles of dopamine in thenucleus accumbens versus serotonin in\nthe nucleus accumbens . By the way,folks, by the time this episode comes\nout, an episode all about MDMA itselfand its modes of action will have already\naired, and you can find that, but evenif you haven't heard that, MDMA is an\namazing molecule because it profoundlyincreases dopamine, and that's why the\nword methamphetamine is actually in MDMA.Still a surprise to many people\nto hear that, but it also robustlyincreases serotonin transmission.And what I love about the paper from\nyour lab that explored this is that, atleast by my read of the data, it showed\nvery convincingly that it's serotoninreleased in the nucleus accumbens that's\nresponsible for the prosocial effectsof MDMA, whereas oxytocin, this thing\nwe talked about earlier that everyoneassumes is the pair bonding molecule,\nthe molecule of love, both in humans,now there's a study in humans and in\nthe mouse work that you've done, doesn'tseem to play as prominent a role in the\nsocial enhancement that MDMA causes.And the reason I'm asking this in\nthe context of autism is that fora long time, there was excitement\nabout the idea that oxytocin nasalsprays might make autistic kids more\nexcited about social interactions,more tuned to social interactions.First question is, is there any\nevidence that increasing oxytocinin a child or adult with autism\nmakes them somehow more social ordesiring more social connections?I'm not aware of any.Robert Malenka: I think it is worthwhile.It has been studied.I don't think we can close the door\non the potential therapeutic uses ofoxytocin from the people I know who\nare much more expert in this than I am.I think most of the clinical trials\nhave been pretty disappointing,with a lot of hope that intranasal\noxytocin would promote morepositive pro social experiences.I don't think the door is shut yet.There may be different\nways of administering it.There may be ways of making a different\ntype of oxytocin that might be beneficial.I have a colleague at Stanford who's\nactually looking at a related neuropeptidecalled vasopressin, and she's finding\nsome potential benefit from that.And vasopressin and oxytocin are\nclosely related to each other.They can even activate some of the same,\nwhat we call receptors in the brain.So I don't think the door is closed\non the possibility of oxytocinor related therapeutic agents\nhaving some therapeutic potential.The evidence, as far as I'm aware,\nis not there yet in terms ofMDMA, again, complicated story."

            "text": "As you pointed out, MDMA, its major\nmolecular targets, don't want to gettoo technical here, are the serotonin\nvacuum cleaner, the molecule that vacuumsup serotonin, and the dopamine vacuum\ncleaner, the molecule that vacuums up,and, excuse my language, sucks up dopamine\nwhen it's released, because it's anamphetamine derivative, as you correctly\npointed out, it not only prevents theseproteins, we call them, these molecules,\nthese vacuum cleaners, from vacuumingup the dopamine and serotonin when it's\nreleased, it actually causes it, howdo I, I don't want to use the terms\nto vomit out dopamine and serotonin--Andrew Huberman: --That's\nwhat I say on the podcast--Robert Malenka: --Am I allowed\nto say that?-- [LAUGHS]Andrew Huberman: --when I talk about\nsynaptic release, I'm known for, on mysolo episodes, for when I talk about\nsynaptic release, I'll say that they[MAKES VOMITING SOUND] they vomit out.[LAUGHS]Robert Malenka: So what\namphetamine derivatives--Andrew Huberman: --But you\nwork on synaptic transmission.That's almost an insult to a\n[inaudible] synaptic transmission.Robert Malenka: What MDMA does\nis it actually calls what'sknown as a reverse transport.It not only prevents the vacuum\ncleaners from sucking up the dopamineand serotonin, it causes it to\nspew out dopamine and serotonin.So imagine if your vacuum cleaner\nstarted, the pressure in your vacuumcleaner reversed, and all the dirt you\ncollected started being spewed out.Now, the one difference for MDMA, and\nit's a fascinating topic, I hope we havetime to talk about, is why does MDMA,\nqualitatively, for most people, givehuman subjects a different experience\nthan cocaine or methamphetamine,or especially methamphetamine.Andrew Huberman: Presumably, it's the\nfact that there's so much serotonin.Robert Malenka: Exactly.And so if you actually get into, and\nthis is why, for your audiences, thisis why hardcore molecular science\ncan actually teach us something aboutcomplex human behavioral phenomena,\nsuch as social interactions andaddiction, at least the hypothesis\nwe propose and others in the field.It's not just, science\nis not done in isolation.So I want to give credit\nwhere creditors do.We did not define the following,\nthat MDMA affects the serotoninsystem more than the dopamine system.So it's not 50/50.Maybe it's 70/30, 80/20.And that's because the molecule itself\nof MDMA, again, I'm trying not to uselanguage, it binds to, has a higher\naffinity, it likes to bind to andinfluence the serotonin vacuum cleaner\nmore than the dopamine vacuum cleaner.It's still affecting\nboth, but it's not 50/50.It's more, whatever, 70%\nserotonin, 30% dopamine.And then it does influence oxytocin\nin very complex ways, which isa further technical discussion.There was just a nice paper that\ncame out that reported that serotoninreleases in a hypothalamic structure,\nwhich, again, the hypothalamus,you can explain to your listeners.Andrew Huberman: A marble-ish size\nstructure above the roof of yourmouth, responsible for sex, temperature\ncontrol, feeding and satiety, anda bunch of other things critical.Robert Malenka: And it's a home\nof neurons that produce oxytocin.Andrew Huberman: Thank you.Robert Malenka: So this paper\nreported that when serotonin isreleased in the hypothalamus, it\nactivates and causes the release ofoxytocin that's in the hypothalamus.Our work in the reward\ncircuitry suggested oxytocin.So that's serotonin upstream of oxytocin\nin the hypothalamus, where we were lookingin the accumbens, it was the opposite.Oxytocin caused the release of serotonin.So the point to your listeners is the\nbrain is unfortunately complicated.It's tractable.We like to come up with general\nhypotheses and principles, butsometimes the devil's in the details,\nand we really need to probe deeper.So back to your question about our\nprevious paper and dopamine and serotonin.So what we proposed, which is far from\nnailed down, is that MDMA, because it isan amphetamine derivative, does influence\ndopamine release and the dopamine system.And some of my colleagues in\nthe MDMA field, who I respectenormously, don't like me to say\nthis, but I'm going to say it anyhow.Remember earlier in the podcast, we\ntalked about different substanceshaving addictive liabilities?Doesn't mean a substance is\nautomatically addictive, doesn'tmean it's automatically not, it's a\ncontinuum, and I would argue that MDMAdoes have some addictive liability\nbecause it is an amphetamine derivative.Andrew Huberman: It feels good.Robert Malenka: And it feels good.And so there are individuals that,\nespecially as your listeners may know,MDMA has gotten a lot of attention\nbecause it's in a therapeutictrial that looks very promising\nas an adjunct to psychotherapy forpost traumatic stress disorder.And the FDA, the part of our government\nthat approves or disapproves the legaldistribution of therapeutic drugs, may\nend up approving MDMA for certain uses.The point being is that if it gets\napproved, my personal feeling is itwill have some addictive liability.It also has this very powerful,\nwhat you and I might termAndrew, a pro social effect.Some people even call it an empathogen.That's a little controversial, meaning\nit enhances your capacity for empathy, toexperience the emotional state of another\nindividual, to want to understand thatperson's experiences and emotional state.And what we've suggested is that\nthe addictive liability is mostly,although not solely, being, mediated\nby its actions on the dopamine system,whereas its positive, more pro social\neffects and perhaps its empathogeniceffects are more likely to be mediated\nby its interactions with the serotoninsystem in this reward circuitry.And we're actually doing a lot\nof work to test that hypothesis.We're actually testing MDMA in\nthese behavioral models of empathyin mice, and it looks like our\nhypothesis is being supported.The other thing to drive your\nlisteners crazy about, sorry,listeners, how complex the brain is.If you think it--Andrew Huberman: --Listen, neither\nyou nor I were consulted at thedesign phase, and so we don't have to\napologize for the brain's complexity.\n Robert Malenka: [LAUGHS] Because, trust\nme, as a scientist, I wish I couldkeep things as simple as possible.That's what good science is.It turns out serotonin is produced\nby neurons in another part of thebrain with this wonderful name\ncalled the dorsal raphe nucleus.And it turns out the serotonin\nneurons talk to the dopamine neuronsand influence the dopamine neurons.It's, again, the point we made earlier\nin your podcast, even though it's funand useful both for your listeners\nand as scientists to think aboutthese powerful chemical messengers\nin isolation, because that's how wecan make progress scientifically.It's how your audience can understand\nsome of the concepts that have beenelucidated from brain research over the\ndecades, but they don't work in isolation.They influence each other.They communicate with each other.We're actually doing studies showing\nthat serotonin release in the accumbensactually modulates dopamine release.So it gets crazy complicated.But you can still develop simplistic\nhypotheses, like, as I was saying, aboutMDMA, where abuse, addictive liability,\nand some of its reinforcing qualities,which you just mentioned, MDMA, a lot of\npeople find it fun to take it, is probablymostly being mediated via the dopamine\nsystem, and some of its social effects arebeing mediated by the serotonin system.We're actually doing studies to\nfigure out whether the reinforcingcomponent of a social experience\nrequires that dopamine release.Probably does.Andrew Huberman: That's\nwhat I'm most interested in,really, in the context of MDMA.And we should just mention, because\nwe do like to mention these caveats.Yes.And I can say this because I\nparticipated in a trial with MDMA.It is a very pleasant experience.It's certainly not for everybody.It still is a schedule\none drug at this moment.Robert Malenka: Absolutely.Andrew Huberman: So you can go to\njail for possessing or selling it.In fact, there was a big bust recently\nin Canada and another one in Brussels.Large amounts of MDMA collected.Those people are probably going to go\nto prison for a long period of time.So you don't want to\ntake it or possess it.It's illegal.We're talking about clinical trials here.But also the fentanyl issue.There's a lot of fentanyl contamination.Robert Malenka: And I was just going\nto mention it to your listeners.Andrew Huberman: So we'd be\nremiss if we didn't mention.A lot of people are dying thinking\nthat they're taking one drugwhen they're taking another.So we are not encouraging\nthe use of these.But I will say that the subjective\nexperience of MDMA, provided it's donein the appropriate clinical setting,\nit's actually, MDMA doesn't containother things dosed correctly, etc., is a pleasant one, for sure.And my sense is that the dopamine release\nis reinforcing the experience, that thecontext that serotonin is providing with\na social context and the word contextthere becomes important when we think\nabout back to the 90s when there were alot of raves and people were also getting,\nI guess, positive feedback from theinteractions they were having, dancing\nall night, partying with friends, etc.I think that returning to the issue\nof autism and the role of serotonin,"

            "text": "so in autism, there seems to be\nless of a reinforcement pathway forcertain kinds of social interactions\nin some individuals with autism.And I'm aware that there are some\nprescription treatments for autismthat capitalize on the serotonergic\nsystem and dopamine system.So is it fentamine?Robert Malenka: To my knowledge,\nthe only FDA approved pharmacologictherapeutic for individuals with autism\nspectrum disorder is actually, oh,God, I'm just blanking, it's not a\nserotonergic drug, I have to look it up.I want to say risperidone for agitation.There is no drug for, for lack of\na better term, the social deficits.There's no FDA approved drug.If you look at the literature,\npsychiatrists and individuals withgood intention have tested the\nutility of traditional serotonergicdrugs like Prozac, SSRIs.There are drugs known as SNRIs, drugs\nthat influence serotonin release, andanother neuromodulator that you know\nwell, norepinephrine and at least welldone clinical trials, which in my view,\nas an academic, are very important.None of them have shown efficacy.Having said that, there are several\ncompanies, and full disclosure here,I am the founder of a small biotech\ncalled Maplite Therapeutics, andI'm not advertising for Maplite.I'm just doing a full disclosure.It was founded with Karl Deisseroth,\nwho you've had on your podcast,and an entrepreneur in San\nFrancisco named Karoly Nikolich.And we have a phase two trial.Phase two trial means it's a safe drug.We've done all the safety work,\nand it's a drug that targets asubtype of receptor for serotonin.Serotonin works on many different,\nI don't know, what word canI use other than receptors?Andrew Huberman: No, listeners\nof this podcast will probablybe familiar with receptors, sort\nof parking spots for molecules.Yes.The paper I was referencing earlier from\nyour lab, it talked about serotonin 1Breceptors being particularly important.Robert Malenka: The point being\nis I do have an interest in this.Can you use the type of\ndiscoveries we've made in mice?Might it actually have any relevance\nto human beings, in particularthose who, some of which have\nsome sort of sociability deficits?Other companies are pursuing this, too.So MDMA itself, there has been.I don't know if it's ongoing.There's a well known organization.I don't know if you've ever had\nanybody from MAPS on this podcast.The Multidisciplinary Association\nfor Psychedelic Studies.MAPS deserves a lot of credit for being\na pioneer in saying, in particular withMDMA, promoting the idea that this drug\ndeserves rigorous and ethical study.That's at least my view and MAPS , which\nwas founded by an individual named RickDoblin, deserves enormous credit for\ntheir 30 year effort to make it allowedand legal to actually study MDMA.The point I'm making is I know\nMAPS, and perhaps others, have donesome small trials studying MDMA in\nindividuals, high functioning individualswith some form of social anxiety.I'm saying this because this is public.There's another company called\nMindMed, which is one of the publiclytraded psychedelic companies,\nand this is on their website.Full disclosure, I am on their\nscientific advisory board.They are gearing up to do a trial\nof a, I don't want to get tootechnical, of a certain form of MDMA.There are two different types of MDMA.They have these horrible\nnames called enantiomers.So the MDMA that is used for clinical\ntrials that MAPS, MDMA is a molecule, andit has mirror images of itself, and one\nhas the name RMDMA and one has the nameSMDMA, and they're called the enantiomers\nbecause they're mirror images of eachother and other labs over the years, not\nmy lab, I deserve no credit for this,have done some studies to suggest that\nthe S enantiomer is the one that hasa higher interaction with the dopamine\nsystem, and the R enantiomer has a higherinteraction with the serotonin system.Andrew Huberman: Interesting.Robert Malenka: If you look at the\nliterature on autism spectrum disorderin human subjects, there's a bunch of\npapers suggesting serotonergic systemsare malfunctioning in individuals\nwith autism spectrum disorder.And if you look at reviews I've\nwritten or any of my papers, weprobably cite some of the reviews.Andrew Huberman: It's clear that\nserotonin is playing some role insocial interactions, at least in mice\nand almost certainly in humans as well.It's hard to imagine, based on data\nfrom everything from SSRIs to neurotoxiclesions of the human brain, etc., that it's not also playing at\nleast a similar role in humans.Robert Malenka: Right, and\nI fully agree with that.And as we were discussing, there's a\nmodestly extensive clinical literature,meaning literature from human subjects,\nsuggesting that some aspects of brainsystems that utilize serotonin as one\nof their signaling molecules, one oftheir neuromodulatory mechanisms, may\nnot be functioning in some populations ofindividuals with autism spectrum disorder.So based on that, based on my lab's\nwork on the role of serotonin inmodifying reward circuitry, its role in\npro social behaviors, and the biggestclue, which I think you would agree\nwith, Andrew, is this drug, MDMA.I mean this is why, I am not a\ndruggie myself, I am a child ofthe '60s and '70s, which means I'm\n20 years older than you, Andrew.I did experiment, like everybody\nof my generation, with psychoactivesubstances in the 70s, so I don't\nwant to lie about my experiences.I also will say, like many\nneuroscientists, my experiences withpsychoactive substances stimulated\nmy interest in neuroscience.How do these substances work?Why, when I was a young kid,\nthe first time I got drunk onbeer, why is that happening?But more seriously, I use drugs in my\nresearch as powerful probes of brainfunction with the advantage that, and now\nI'm talking scientist to scientist withyou, Andrew, they have molecular targets\nthat we can manipulate in rigorous ways.We can figure out where in the\nbrain they act using the moderntools of neuroscience, which\nyour audience may not know about.I'm saying this to you, conditional\nknockout mice, rescue experiments.We can do all this fancy stuff,\nand we can use drugs to study eventhings as complicated as empathy.And I really do believe that it's\nwhy I've been interested in MDMA fordecades, is there's a clue there.How does a drug that has molecular\ntargets in the dopamine neuromodulatorysystem, in the serotonin\nneuromodulatory system have such apowerful effect, which is relatively\nspecific on social interactions?It doesn't make you want\nto go eat more donuts.I don't know, for me,\nthere's a clue there.There's something really important from\nthat phenomenological observation in thehuman experiences that we can learn from.Andrew Huberman: I completely agree\nabout MDMA, and we've done a couple"

            "text": "and MDMA, which isn't really a classic\npsychedelic, but all these drugs that,as you pointed out during your youth,\nwere used recreationally and for mindexploration and expansion and are now\nbeing probed as potential therapeuticsfor various mental health challenges,\nas well as potentially expandingconsciousness, empathy, and all of that.I mean, not getting into the details\nof the legal issues that have to beovercome, not even necessarily talking\nabout the clinical trials or thepeople doing the work in different\nlaboratories, but just, I have to imaginethis must amuse, tickle, surprise you.I mean, how do you feel\nabout what you're seeing now?Because it is a very exciting\ntime for these compounds.Robert Malenka: It tickles me and\nexcites me with the appropriate caution.So I do think drugs are very\npowerful probes of brain function.I think this class of drug, which, as\nyou correctly pointed out, people usethe term psychedelics scientifically.When pursuing their understanding,\ntheir therapeutic potential,their mechanism of action.It's more useful to divide them\nup into different categories.The classic hallucinogens, which are\nLSD and psilocybin, the intact orempathogens, which is MDMA, which is\nreally a qualitatively different drug.There are other substances which\nwe don't have time to talk about,like ibogaine and ayahuasca, which\nare very complex, and peyote.But nevertheless, I am tickled and\nexcited as a child of the '60s and '70s.But I am also not evangelical about their\nuse and their therapeutic potential.So as you can imagine what I'm going\nto say, I think they should be thesubject of rigorous, sophisticated,\nand most importantly, ethical research.I think we could learn a lot about how the\nbrain works and its amazing capabilities.I think they may notice, I say may have\ntherapeutic potential, but I do notthink they're going to be miracle cures.And I do worry, as somebody who\nlived through the '60s and '70s andwatched, because of the history of\nTimothy Leary and his colleagues,and the political landscape of how\nthey were being used and promoted,I am cautious that these substances\nneed to be studied scientifically andrigorously, and I hope that's the case.And I want to caution your\naudience that not everybodyshould take these substances.They are not miracle cures.And while they certainly may be of benefit\nto certain individuals who are suffering,and they certainly may provide unusual\nand \"mystical\" experiences for certainindividuals, I am very concerned that\nthere are individuals out there that willgain access to these substances and have\nvery bad experiences, because anybodywho grew up in the '60s and '70s knows\nall about bad trips, and truth be told,I have had a bad trip or two in the '70s,\nand I'm glad I did, because it made me...I have no idea what a suicidal depression\nfeels like where you are experiencing sucha darkness, such a lack of hope that a\nrational decision is to end one's life.And I think the closest I ever came to\nthat experience is a bad trip on LSD.And I do have concerns that if you\nlook at the clinical trials thathave been done, the well done, not\nthe anecdotal, I went and saw somepsychedelic therapist that a friend\nrecommended and it did wonders for me.But the well controlled clinical trials\nthat are being done by certain biotechs,some academic institutions, they have very\nstrict, what are known as inclusionaryand exclusionary criteria about who is\nallowed to participate in the subject,and they rule out a lot of people.So I don't mean to be overly cautious,\nbut I do worry that if some people takethese substances and bad things happen,\nit will slow down the excitement that'scurrently happening, and it will make\nit more difficult for serious humansubjects researchers, preclinical\nresearchers, to study these substancesin the way they deserve to be studied.So I hope that articulates my viewpoint.Andrew Huberman: I think it does,\nand thank you for that viewpoint.It's an important counterbalance\non a lot of the excitementthat we hear about these days.I think the state of Kentucky just\nrecently decided to give $42 million fromthe opioid lawsuit settlement with Purdue\npharmaceuticals to the study of ibogaine.So there's a lot happening.Robert Malenka: Just to be clear, I\nthink there's no problem with that,and I actually would support that.As long as the studies of ibogaine\nare done thoughtfully, carefully,and ethically, I see no problem\nwith testing its efficacy in certainmental illnesses and addiction.And it's actually a topic I know\na little bit about, but we'llsave that for another time.Andrew Huberman: Great.Well, first off, I want to thank\nyou for coming here and sharingyour knowledge with all of us.For me, it's been a real thrill.And I also just want to thank you\nfor the incredible amount of workthat you've done over the years.I know it's still ongoing.You're by no means retiring.I certainly hope not.But I'm sure the listeners have now\ngotten a clear picture of the enormousnumber of contributions and areas you've\nworked on everywhere from, as I mentionedearlier, neuroplasticity at the cellular\nlevel, molecular level, addiction, workrelating to social cognition and social\ninteractions, rather as it pertainsto autism models, and now psychedelics\nand empathy, and on and on and again,trained so many prominent scientists in\nour field, and to take time out of yourschedule to come sit here with us and\nshare some of that knowledge and stimulateour thinking and, as you mentioned,\nraise still more questions that needto be resolved is a real privilege.So thank you ever so much.And indeed, as you just mentioned,\nwe'd love to have you backagain for another conversation.Robert Malenka: All I can say is\nI want to thank you for having me.I was a little hesitant or nervous about\ncoming here, and now I want to come back.So that was a blast, what I just\ndid with you, and I'd be happy tocontinue this conversation anytime.So thank you for your very\nsophisticated and thoughtful questions.Andrew Huberman: To be

We discuss the brain\u2019s several reward systems involving dopamine and serotonin and how these motivate us to seek out specific behaviors and substances. We discuss how these reward systems are modified based on context and our memories, and how they can be hijacked toward maladaptive drug seeking in addiction. We also explore how reward systems influence social connections, oxytocin and empathy and how that applies to our understanding of autism spectrum disorders.
