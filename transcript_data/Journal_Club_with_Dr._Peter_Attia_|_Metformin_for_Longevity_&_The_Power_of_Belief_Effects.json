    "episode_summary": "In this journal club episode, my guest is Stanford and Johns Hopkins-trained physician, Dr. Peter Attia, M.D., who is also the host of The Drive podcast and the author of the bestselling book \"Outlive: The Science & Art of Longevity.\"\nWe each present a scientific paper and discuss the findings' strengths, weaknesses and actionable takeaways.\nFirst, we discuss an article that addresses whether taking the drug metformin can enhance longevity. Then, we discuss an article on belief effects (similar to placebo effects), showing how the effects of a drug on the brain and cognition depend on one's belief about the dose of the drug taken, not the actual dose.\nOur conversation also highlights how to read, interpret and critique scientific studies. This episode ought to be of interest to those curious about health and longevity, medicine and psychology and for anyone seeking to better understand how to read and digest scientific findings.\nFor show notes, including referenced articles and additional resources, please visit hubermanlab.com.
