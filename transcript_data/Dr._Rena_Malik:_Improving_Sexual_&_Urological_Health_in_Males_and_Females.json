            "text": "honor to be here I'm delighted to haveyou here I'm a huge fan of your contentI find that you are able to delivercritical information about sexual healthUrology pelvic floorlibido and so many other things that areof immense interest to people but thatordinarily people don't really knowwhere to get the high qualityinformation and coming to you for thatinformation means they are going to getthe highest quality information I trulybelieve that becauseas everyone will soon hear today we'regoing to have a very Frank discussionbut one that's really grounded inscience and medicinearound sexual health and related topicsthese are topics that typically peoplelearn aboutperhaps a little bit in school maybe athomefrom Friendsusually overhearing things as opposed todirect exploratory conversationonlinepornographyand at least in my experience growing upyou know there was education aroundSexual Health reproductive Health Etcthat was more oriented toward the fearofthings like STIs fear of unwantedpregnancy all of which of course isextremely important for people to learnabout but far less about sort of thehealthy versions of sexual health rightyeah absolutely so this is an especiallyimportant conversationuh it's also one that I thinkhas a backdrop that we should justacknowledge right off the bat thatbecause the information is gleaned frommultiple sources and because there areum let's just say uh influences outthere that relate to the morality ofdifferent practices that there can beshamethere can be misunderstanding there canbe secrecy and that further leads tomisinformation so I'm confident thattoday you can clarify things for us andwe're going to stay out of thosetrenches and the last thing I'd like tosay is that because a number of termswill certainly come up and I think forsome people they're not used to hearingand general discourse I'm just going toget them out of the way now penis vaginaanus prostate you know what else isthere we're going to talk about libidowe're going to talk about intercourseoral sex anal sex we're going to talkabout all of that so I just want to getthat out there so that um we can reducethe shock uh the shock response I loveit we got to talk about all of it greatso to start things off in anticipationof this episode I solicited forquestions on social media and I gotthousands of questions but there was alot of overlap in the questionssoto start off I'd like to talk aboutpelvic floor okay because both males andfemales have a pelvic floorand my understanding is that there's amuscular component there's a neuralmuscular component there's a blood flowcomponentwhat is a healthy pelvic floor what doesa healthy pelvic floor do and then wecan talk about some of the health issuesthat an unhealthy pelvic floor createsand some of the ways to ameliorate anunhealthy pelvic floor absolutely sopelvic floor very simply is basically abowl of muscles that's connected tobones that hold up all your organs sobasically in your pelvis there's allthese muscles there and their functionis essentially many it helps withurination defecation sexual function ithelps with posture and so having astrong healthy pelvic floor can meanthat you're having normal urinationyou're having normal defecation you'rehaving great sex and that you are alsonot having ailments like back pain orissues related to those those functionsand those organsand so you know pelvic floor is is soimportant in so many different aspectsand we deal with it a lot as urologistsbecause it's so integral to thesefunctions that we take care of and sowhen you have an unhealthy pelvic floorit can vary from person to person andwhile you hear about it a lot in womenmen also suffer from pelvic floordysfunction or problems with the pelvicfloor so basically pelvic floordysfunction happens a lot when you'redoing things like if you were to go tothe gym and do repetitions of of anysort of exercise and you didn't restthen that muscle would become contractedand short very similarly if your pelvicfloor is over strained it can becomecontracted and short and tight all thetime and you may not know it it may justbe a function of stress anxiety oroveruse or posture problems things ofthat nature that can affect your pelvicfloor and so this can lead to issueslet's start with urination you can havesymptoms of urgency frequency meaningyou have to go a lot to the bathroom oryou have to go and have a sudden desirethat you can't delay sometimes even haveleakage in some cases it can make itdifficult to urinate because the pelvicfloor is so tense or perhaps toincompletely vacate the bladder correctlike you go to urinate and then you goback to your desk or then five minuteslater you have to urinate again exactlysomething of that well it can be eitherthat you're not emptying completely orthat the pelvic floor muscles are sotense that they're stimulating thebladder so it feels like there's more togo so it's not always that you're notevacuating it can present in a number ofdifferent waysand then with uh with sexual function itif it's very tense you can have pain soyou can have pain with sex you can havepain with erections you can have painwith ejaculation sometimes it can be alot of different kind of pain syndromesand you're like I have all thesedifferent things going on and it'sreally just pelvic floor dysfunctionum with with GI function you candefinitely have constipation and thenoften you can also have back pain and soall of these things can happen when yourpelvic floor is too tense sometimes yourpelvic floor can be too weak and thatcan be often because of we see this inwomen a lot because of childbirthdelivering children with some people whohave neurologic disorders they can haveweak pelvic floors or connective tissuedisorders like there's download syndromefor example these sorts of things cancause weakness to the pelvic floor whichcan then cause very often what I see islike urinary incontinence or leakagewhich can then you know create problemsfor people down the linethank you for that so first question how"

            "text": "does somebody know if their pelvic flooris too tight from a over contraction orchronic contraction of the muscles thereversus too weak and one of thechallenges in having this conversationis that if we were talking aboutcontraction of the calf muscle or thebicep I think everyone intuitively knowsbecause they've seen the shortening ofthe muscles when the muscle is quoteunquote flexed and the lengthening ofthe muscles when it is relaxedum is there a way to describe pelvicfloor muscular shortening in a way thateveryone can understand would this belikeum like I said we're going to be directtoday would this like be like tensing upone's um uhanus and the opposite of of the movementthat one would do before initiating abowel movement and relaxation is sort ofthe pattern of pelvic floor muscularrelaxation just priorto initiating a bowel movement so I willsay most people can't recognize itbecause it's very difficult to noticeit's sort of uh gradual and so it canover time become noticeable with thesesymptoms but otherwise it's verydifficult because it's not a muscle thatwe were ever trained to recognize rightlike you hear about Kegel exercises forexample and people talk about how to dothem but that's all you ever hear aboutthe pelvic floor and so you don't reallyknow how to kind of do things in a waythat protects your pelvic floor or um orkind of what how to even tell when it'stoo tight or not relaxing and so thattakes a sort of a training and sousually when people come to First youget an examination to see if your pelvicfloor is tight so for women it's apelvic exam and for men it's usually arectal exam how does how does that examgo so you know it's essentiallypalpating the muscles and also lookingat the function so we'll say for digitalpalpation where that's a medicaltechnology for fingers they're calleddigits uh soum you know I'm old enough to uh torecognize what a digital prostate examis right the physician inserts theirfingers through it into the anus and andand feels the prostate to see whether ornot it's swollen or not and and as I'msaying this I'm realizing you knowsometimes we think of medicine quoteunquote modern medicine is so evolvedthis is basically basically been thepractice for what 50 years 60 yearsmaybe 100 years in the same way that thethe old school practice for glaucomaexcessive eye pressure was for thephysician to just touch the eyeball souh folks for those of you that thinkthat medicine has evolved much uh itclearly has in many ways butum in any event so a prostate exam goesas I just described what would a whatwould a pelvic floor exam for a male anda pelvic floor exam for a femaleum involved at a kind of granular levelyeah so for for women you can feel thepelvic floor muscles through the vaginaso you can feel the iliococcygeus thepubic oxygous the levator Ani those areall names of different muscles in thisbowl this is the physician who can feelthem with their fingers correct and youknow you could too you could put yourfinger in but you don't have a referenceof normal right so you wouldn't knowwhat a normal pelvic floor feels likeversus a tight one versus a weak one andso you can assess the tenseness based onyou know palpation you can also see ifthere's tenderness and so you can assessthat based on just a general physicalexamination and then also you canobserve so I can say contract yoursqueeze your pelvic floor up and then Ican look and see are they squeezing orare they pushing like are theycoordinated or not right because that'sa function of normal use of the pelvicfloor and sometimes you'll see thatthey're just coordinated you can alsoassess for sensation in the area andthings like that that could beconsequences of dysfunction can there bedysfunction in laterality like thepelvic floor is pulling up and to theright or up and to the left absolutelyso what typically when you see a pelvicfloor therapist now I'm not a pelvicfloor therapist but these are the peoplewho will do the work right they theywork with you on a prolonged basis tohelp you normalize the function of yourpelvic floor it's like going to the gymwith a trainer right they really workwith you to get your pelvic floorfunctioning correctly and the first stepto that a lot of pelvic floor therapistswill just align your bones and and youryour kind of the way you sit and walk tomake sure that you're not strainingthose muscles by pulling in different indifferent directions and if a male goesto the physician to get a pelvic floorexamum there's obviouslydifficulty in putting fingers into theurethra one would hope too small anopening so how are they doing the pelvicfloor exam is it external to the body oris it through the anus so some of it'sthrough the anus you can feel themuscles through the at least and thenyou can feel the perineal area and feelthe muscles there as well as Sensationsso okay so perineal area so from theoutside of the body okayum the region between the scrotum andthe anus yes okay so it sounds to melike if people want to geta high quality assessment of whether ornot their pelvic floor is healthy or notthey need to see a pelvic floorspecialist that it's not the sort ofthing that they could into on their ownnecessarily it would be difficult I meanso there are things you can buy onlinelike probes that you can insert in thevagina that will teach you how to dokegel exercises and give you some readyou know some readings but they're notreally meant to diagnose they're usuallysomething people use if they they have aweak pelvic floor and they want to tryto do it at home on their own so there'snothing that's going to give you like abaseline reading is this normal orabnormal let's talk about kegelsum first of all who's Kegel"

            "text": "our entire discussion today should beframed up at least in the back of ourminds and the minds of our listeners andviewers as involving at least threethings you know anytime we're talkingabout erectile function or dysfunctionor pelvic floor function or dysfunctionor vaginal lubrication or lack thereofwe need to think about the hormonalinfluencesthe blood flow related influences andthe neural influences including theneural influences that come from thebrain the signals of arousal forinstance or lack of arousal um and so onso we won't be overly systematic in inour parsing of all this but I I thinkwhat you just mentioned raises a reallyimportant point that sometimes in aneffort to do something that's good forthe muscles like strengthen the musclesone will cut off blood flow in fact oneof the more common questions I got and Iconsulted with a couple of exercisephysiologists about this and theyconfirmed that a lot of people who Squatand deadlift heavy in the gymor even who just tense their pelvicfloor when they're doing things likedumbbell curls or other exercisesand especially people who seem to do alot of abdominal workreported to me in the questions thatthey experienced things like erectiledysfunctionthat they experience things like painduring vaginal intercoursethat essentially they had created somesort of what sounds to me like a hypercontraction of the muscles in that areathat were impeding all the things thatthey wanted as either side effects orDirect effects of exercise because manypeople are exercising for aestheticreasons and health reasons but nowadaysit seems especially on the male side butwe'll also talk about the role oftestosterone on the female side a lot ofmales lift weights in order to increasetheir testosterone and for reasons thatare obvious also want to have healthysexual function and here they are doingthis thing that's very good forincreasing testosterone if they're doingit correctly and testosterone isinvolved in libido and the male sexualresponse and the female sexual responseof coursebut they are impeding their erections soyou can start to see how um there areprobably a lot of confused and maybeeven distraught people out there they'retrying to do all the right things andthey're setting up roadblocks and evenum sending themselves backward in somecases so the question ishow does one know whether or notsomething likeum let's say low lubrication or painduring vaginal intercourse or loss oferectile strength or some sort oferectile dysfunction whatever it may bebecause it can take on different formsas we'll talk about how does one know ifit's blood flow related hormone relatedor neural related and if it's neuralrelated how does one know if it's anissue of lack of appropriate signalsfrom the brain over suppression or lackof arousal from the brain or whether ornot it's some peripheral neural thing ofinnervation of the penis or vagina so Ithink there's there's a lot that we cango into here but essentially first youwant to find out like very specificallywhat is going on are you getting arousedare you having erections are youmasturbating like there's all thesequestions that will help us go down theroad sorry to interrupt when you sayaroused um for sake of this discussion Ijust want to make sure that wedistinguish between psychologicalarousal the desire to toum I guess here we also have to bepreciseum arousal to engage in Intercourse andarousal toum desire essentially I think peoplelearn to recognize or are we talkingabout arousal as the response of thegenitals correct so so desire andarousal this is a very important conceptdoesn't always go in One Directionsometimes you can feel arousal meaningyou have the telltale signs of arousalyour nipples get erect you have morelubrication if you're a female you'reboth male and female nipples get erectduring around I believe so I think soum you know you maybe get the secondflush right you get some some redness orwarmth feeling that's your body'sresponse right to arousal and sometimesthat can be an erection and sometimesthat's not not having an erection doesnot mean you're not aroused it may meanother things but certainly that's partof it and then desire do you want tohave sex do you have like when you thinkabout your partner or you whoever youwant to engage with does is there adesire to actually do that right or isit just more of obligation or otherthings and does it is that it doesn'tmatter if the desire comes after arousalfor some women in particular we see thatthey may not have the desire right awaybut they want to be intimate or closewith their partner and so they'll startjust being close with them and thenarousal will come and then oh yeah youknow I like this so then the desirecomes after and that's normal that'stotally fine so you want to kind ofparse that out and then for men you canask are you getting erections at nightbecause that will tell us the functionof your organ at night very versusduring the day where you have alsopsychogenic components right you canreally get in your head about erectionswhen you have a problem in the bedroomwith performance it becomes a viciouscycle right so you you have a problemthe next time you're really stressedyou're not present you're not mindful inthe moment with sex and you're thinkingabout oh my God am I going to performokay am I going to perform okay and thenit doesn't perform again and you're justit's getting worse and worse and theanxiety is through the roof and that'sactually causing your sexual dysfunctionso I think it's it's important first toidentify those issues and then also forblood flow a lot of times we can we canassess based on well what othercomorbidities do you have do you haveother issues ongoing that may beaffecting your blood flow most commonhigh blood pressure diabetes heartdisease and if you smoke all of thosethings will affect blood flow to thegenitals and so that will Pointnegatively negatively negatively so sothat will point us to a more vascularissue hormonal issues are very importantfor desire and and you know as far assexual function in terms of erectionsthere's only three percent of erectiledysfunction that's related to hormonesso it's actually pure erectile functioncorrect as opposed to desire correct thedesire is desire is predominantlymodulated by the hormone testosteronefor both men and women in fact if you alot of people don't know this but womenhave more testosterone in their bodiesand they actually have estrogen sotestosterone is very important for bothmen and women for a variety of reasonsand so you you know using thatdiscussion with the patient will helpyou kind of identify where you're headedin terms of what you need to focus onfor treatment there are you know certainthings you can use to assess blood flowyou can do Doppler ultrasounds of thepenis as well as the clitoris to see ifthere is good blood flow you can assessthe peak systolic velocity which

okay they arehormonal in in general and arousal interms of lubrication if you're usingthat as a as a barometer yes you can seeless vaginal lubrication due to hormonesand I guess I would say three to sixpercent more you know up to six percentwe see of erectile dysfunction ishormonal it's a small percentage of theentire entirety of erectile dysfunctionokay so I think in looking on thelandscape of social media podcasts andand just in the commonum mindset we've all come to believethat testosterone is pro libido it's Prodesire in men and women I think nowpeople are starting to appreciate thatit's Pro desire and women as wellum but certainly in men and thatdopamine is also associated with desireand the general public tends to havethis view of estrogen as being sort ofanti-libido or anti-male which isfrankly false in fact and I've coveredthis on the podcast with Dr KyleGillette and with Dr Peter attia and umanother fellow YouTuber uh Derek frommore plates more dates has talked a lotabout the fact that if people if menexcuse me take drugs like an astrozoleto suppress their estrogenthinking that oh it's all about havinghigh testosterone low estrogenoftentimes they Crush their libido justabolish it yeah which um has led to aslowly growing but I think positiveshift in how people are thinking aboutestrogen estrogen is great for brainfunction estrogen is great for libido inmen and women correct um andthat is a revision of I I think how mostpeople think of the male sexual responseit's more in keeping with how peoplethink about the female sexual responseoh estrogen and the female sexualresponse that that makes sense but whatwe're trying to do here is clarify someof the um misconceptions now the reasonI mentioned dopamine is that myunderstanding is that dopamine isinvolved in the Ural excuse me thedesire response we will distinguishdesire the psychological arousal fromgenital arousal physical arousaland that prolactin is associated withthe refractory period during whicherection can't occur another perhapsorgasm can't occur in females Etc butmy understanding is that's also not thatsimple and we need to take a step backperhaps and just talk about thephysiological underpinnings of thedesire and arousal response so I'll tellyou what I was taught and then you cantell me where it's wrong sure I hope Iwas taught thatthe erection response and the vaginallubrication response is generated by theparasympathetic nervous system therelaxed the rest and digest aspect ofthe nervous systemhence why some people can getpsychogenic sexual issues of lack oferection or lack of vaginal lubricationbutthat there are individuals out there forwhoma lot of alertness maybe even and thisis a controversial thing but for somepeople even some sense of aggression orkind of edginess or excitementadrenaline in other words can stimulateerection or vaginal lubrication so itgets tricky like it's not like thetextbooks it's not like they taught usin high school as far as I know I wastaught that the arousal response inmales and females is initiated by aparasympathetic sort of relaxed toneand that as sexual desire and arousaland sex or masturbation progresses thatit shifts more towards the sympatheticnervous system which has nothing to dowith emotional sympathy and haseverything to do with arousal thecatecholamines dopamine norepinephrineand epinephrine also called adrenalineand noradrenaline are released and thatthe climax response which may or may notinclude ejaculation we have to separatethat out is one that is really of thestress system of the body and then inthe post-coital or post-ejaculatory orpost climax phasethen there's a shift back to theparasympathetic nervous systemum that's whereum the pillow talk and the uh theexchange of uh odors and tastes andother molecules is known to enhance pairbonding through things like oxytocinvasopressin and so on and what I justdescribed is exceedingly oversimplifiedI realize but is that more or less howthe physiology works yeah so the waywe're taught in medical schools pointand shoot so point is theparasympathetic nervous system oh you'reall the male audience will like that oneyeah and then you know you go on to thesympathetic nervous system but it makessense and the reason that I think you'rehearing about this aggression or orthese things that are leading to arousalis because there needs to be a stimulusright a visual stimulus a tactilestimulus some sort of stimulus thatyou're getting that is then causing therelease of nitric oxide from theparasympathetic nervous system and thatcould be for some people aggression oror you know some form of that rightpeople about nitric oxide because we'llget into this when we talk aboutdrugs that increase blood flow CialisViagra and alsoum non-prescription drugs things likel-citrulline Arginine and um watermelonfor that matter right um so I read onthe internet yeahso yeah so nitric oxide is essentiallythe ignition for what we say forerections the ignition for erectionsthat we if you the reason I talk abouterections more often is when you look atthe data in fact there was a paper onthis where they looked at the number ofarticles that came up when you put inthe word penis and the number ofarticles that came up when you put inthe word clitoris and it was 50 000about penis and 2 000 about the clitorisokay we have to we this was actually amajor section of the comments yeah onwhen I asked for for questions onInstagramum and comments on comments and yeah howcomeum why not Etc is that because theUrology and um sexual health field wasdominated by men that's going to be thepresumption or is it because it's easierto study somehow or I mean what's goingon here yeah I think there's been a lotofum I mean you can go back to like Freudwhere he thought that that the femalesexual response was less valuable andand so there are some some reasonsvaluable I guess that's the right termbut no no I'm not challenging your termI just ran uh you know he seemed to beobsessed with it right but it was moreabout the male sexual response than thefemale sexual response and so in generalyes there is you know there were moremen in medicine there was more and it iseasier to study right you can't studythe clitoris quite as easy as you canstudy the male penis response becauseyou can see it visually you can injectit and see an erection response right wedo this for people who have erectiledysfunction they'll take medicationsthat increase blood flow like trimix andyou'll inject it into the penis andyou'll see an erection so you canactually try mix try mix so there's it'sin here the entire male audience justwent away so there there are there arethree basically brand names ofintracavernosal injections that we usefor erectile dysfunction I hearinjection and sickness and I I thinkit's a I like to think that it reflectsa natural male response I sort of uhum I taken aback I don't know maybethere's a pelvic floor contractions inthere someplace so so it is it is scaryto hear about it's a very small needleit is very well tolerated I've done itto patients in the office and they lookat me and say you're done like theydon't even you know it's it's not aspainful as it seems and when you are nothaving erections and you've triedmultiple things people get to the pointwhere they're willing to try that I youknow and and so it is very effectiveit's the most effective non-surgicaltreatment we have for erectiledysfunction and it's usually either onemedication two medications or three soyou can have uh you know alprostadelpavering and the third one that's a goodwe can um look at someone will put it inthe commentsum uh surely they willum what what is it designed to do is itis it um a vasodilator of sorts so theythey work in different mechanisms butsimilar to the medications that we havepde5 Inhibitors pde5 Inhibitors work inthe erection Cascade basically whathappens let's actually let's take itback to the nitric oxide thing we'll getthere so nitric oxide essentially isreleased by the endothelium in responseto a visual tactile stimuli stimulatingcue right and so your body releasesnitric oxide which then sets off theCascade for the erection and so thatreleases cgmp which is which is causesthe erection and it's degraded byphosphodiesterase and so medicationsthat inhibit phosphodiesterase likeViagra and Cialis tend to prevent thebreakdown of that cgmp so you havelonger lasting erections and sosimilarly these medications work sort ofsimilar to that some of them we don'tknow exactly how they work but they workby increasing increasing cgmp or campthat are involved in those Cascades andwhat about l-citrulline I hear about"

in wherekids would stash them in um in specificlocations in parking lots and then youknow boys would bike or skateboard overor walk over and then they would liketake terms look take turns excuse melooking at them but that that actuallyis to raise uh perhaps a more importantPointum which is that looking at pornographyis different than masturbating topornography which is also different thanmasturbating to pornography to the pointof ejaculation right becauseum I also get a lot of questions frompeople about their porn addiction issuesand there's a growing Theory out therethat overuse that meaning not justlooking at butum masturbating to pornography to thepoint of ejaculation is creating adeficit of seeking out andum cultivating healthy real world sexualinteractions yeah so I want to I want tostart this before I get into that is isto say that if you're masturbating toporn and you have normal healthyrelationships and you're going to workand you're have a great you know apartner and everything's great in yourlife it's okay like shame is a realproblem and maybe they're watchingpornography together yeah so I think youknow I think it's important though thatat least in the literature they describethey don't describe porn addiction theycall it problematic pornography use andit's only describing about four percentof people in these studies so it's it'sa small subset of people I think it'sbecoming more common because pornographyis so accessible and it activates thedopamine Pathways just like any othersort of addiction right you you watchpornography you get a dopamine responseyour brain then says Oh I wanna I wantthat again and you keep seeking morenovel more aggressive different types ofpornography to get that same responsebut it doesn't happen to everybody butalso I would say um sorry to interruptbut um that the dopamine response as ahardwired biological mechanismfor adaptive behaviors including andlet's just Define healthy sexualbehavior because I feel likeum there's such a range on thatdepending on one's background religiousbeliefs Etcum anytime we talk about sex on thispodcast I like to say that involves atleast four thingsobviously consensualage-appropriatecontext appropriatespecies appropriate yes absolutelyabsolutely that I'm really glad youbrought that up so I've heard you saythat before but it's very important andso I think you know there is a spectruma large spectrum of people who watchpornography ejaculate to pornography andhave a normal life and so that's fine Ithink that you know if we shame thosepeople we're creating problems right wesay like oh you you do that that'shorrible and then they're in their headright and then they're causing problemsin their life because they're because ofShame and so there's I I think there's alittle bit ofum cultural shame that comes of thisdiscussion and so you know it's aproblem in the long term if we if we saythat oh this is going to create problemsbecause not everyone has there's so manypeople who watch pornography and have noproblems who you know have normalhealthy relationships great sex withtheir partner and it's fine or they'rebetween relationships yeah and they'rerelying on masturbation specificallyrightum are there any data that distinguishbetweenum Just Pure Imagination Fantasy Versusvisual fantasy as it relates todeveloping or inhibiting sexual healthand here we're talking about the desireaspect let's assume physical arousal isyou know handled so no pun intended so Ithink thatum the the thing about young people Iwant to get back to that then I'llanswer your question but the thing aboutyoung people who are watchingpornography that's what they think sexis supposed to be like they don't get aneducation about what sex is right no onehas a conversation with their kids likehey guys this is what happens when youhave sex this is how long it should takethis is what foreplay is and this islike not normal this is the productionthis is a produced product that's meantto arouse you right and and to give youideally an ejaculation or an orgasmright soum no one has that discussion so if mengo to relationships like why did mypartner not react like that woman did onthe porno right or why did I not reactlike that woman did on the porno whydidn't he reaction yeah when you knowlike they would in porn because again Ithink females are watching porn as wellexactly yeah you know I think so I thinkthat you raise a really critical pointwhich is that the shame can extend bothwaysand so I think to that end that's aproblem and and because it's soaccessible I think we need to haveconversations I think it needs to beopen we have to talk about sex andthat's kind of why I do what I do wehave to have these conversations sopeople know what normal is thank you forthat I do think that people need to knowwhat normal is and what the range onnormal is keeping the constraints thatwe talked about placed earlier because Ido think those are

that I'maware of um is uh in that's often usedin let's say Niche culturesum is melanocyte stimulating hormone inmen which gives people a tan makes themerect um the melanocyte stimulatinghormone and msh comes from the mediadeal pituitary if I'm not mistaken oneof those weird regions no everyone talksabout anterior poster but and people arenow injecting this as a peptide it cancause pre-opism I have not had thatexperience I've never tried this um mshbut I've been told that it it people aregetting Cavalier with it they can haveissues uh pre-pism being enduring andperhaps even finalerection is that true yeahI mean it's actually from priapists theGreek god who is often photographed witha really big erection oh well we didn'thear enough about that Greek god inschool but um or is it Roman Roman orGreek but anyways so either way um it'san erection that lasts longer than fourhours and it is actually a surgical orit's not a surgical but it's actually anemergency if you have an erection thatlasts longer than four hours in theabsence of you know sexual arousal thenit is important to get to an emergencyroom because at that point you can startdeveloping decreased blood flow andultimate really no changes to the actualtissues scarring fibrosis so it's reallyimportant to actually go to theemergency room don't wait because you'reembarrassed really get there and gettreated however if I'm not mistakenearlier you mentioned that it isexceedingly rare that people who takeCialis slash to Dallas or Viagra forerections are getting true priapismcorrect and it's mostly from uh thoseinjectables we talked about earlierthose intracavernosal injections peoplecan get priapism from those a little bitmore commonly and so that's something wealways Counsel on and also certainmedications like trazodone or if youhave sickle cell anemia those are themost common reasons that we see peoplecoming in with priorities okay I'm goingto refrain from my um desire to figureout that one so I don't take us down arabbit hole here sorry I wanted to getback to the msh there's actually an FDAapproved medication called briemelanotide is the brand name vilisi isthe uh the sorry brie melaton is ageneric name vilisi is the brand namewhich is FDA approved for women withwith low design hypoactive sexualdesired disorder premenopausal womenpre-menopausal because that's what theystudied but it is basically the samepeptide right so it is a melanocortinreceptor Agonist and it works dope youknow on the the brain Pathways toincrease desire it's taken as aninjectable again just like you saidabout an hour 45 minutes before one whenyou want to want you take it 45 minutesbefore and it works quite effectively inincreasing desire how long does it lastabout 24 hours some people may be up to48. um has it been I mean I know of menusing melanocyte stimulating hormonepeptides I also really want to cautionpeopleum about obtaining gray Market peptidessorry for this um uh insertion here butum there are a lot of peptides availablewithout a prescription on the internetthey are almost all contaminated withsomething called LPS Lippypolysaccharide which is not somethingyou want to be injecting a lot over timethat's actually how we induce an immuneresponse in animals in the laboratoryand it is amazing to me how manywebsites are selling this stuff and itum arrives to you easily you just buy iton the internet says not for human oranimal use and people are injecting itand the LPS issue is something I thinkis um potentially going to shut downthat whole Market at some point but ifyou're interested in using a peptide youshould be obtaining it by a prescriptionfrom a quality physician exactly andbecause we have Brie melanotide we canprescribe that for men as well sosometimes we'll do it off label from menwho are having delayed ejaculationbecause it will help them achieve orgasma little bit better and so you know thisis available for pre-menopausal womenthe other uh medication that's availablefor low libido is called phlebanserinalso known as Addie is the brand nameand that also works on Sarah's it's gotkind of a mixed response serotonin anddopaminergic areas of the brain

you need to take it for some timenow both of these are brand namemedications so they are a little bitcostly and sometimes insurance doesn'tcover them but they are available and Ithink very few people

adigit finger to be more specific so itwhat it does is the cervix moves up andout of the way the the inner one-thirdtwo-thirds of the vagina lengthens andelongates to allow for penetration andit can actually double nearly double insize of the of the Baseline vaginallength and so it is preparing for thatso if you and so that's part of it insome people who have Painful intercourseit's because they haven't had adequatetime for arousal and so they're thepenis is penetrating before they've hadthose adaptations to occur and also thelabia open up to allow for thatpenetration so these things actuallyhappen physiologically to allow forPreparation so while some people may bearoused and get to that point quickersome people do need a longer period oftime of what as you described beforeplay and not everyone is is the same butI think it's important to have thatdiscussion with your partner and youknow lubrication is one of the ways thatpeople assess arousal but that's not thebe-all end-all some people just make alot of lubrication and some people don'tand certainly that changes with age andhormones so if um certainly we know thatafter menopause with a drop in estrogenand testosterone you will see a decreasein lubrication and sometimes if peopleare on medications that can alter theirhormonal access they may also seechanges in lubrication after duringbreastfeeding you can see changes inlubrication and again this is not athey're not aroused necessarily this islike a physiologic problem that they'rehaving can we distinguish betweenarousal-based lubrication let's saysexual arousal based lubrication andagain folks forgive me for being sohyper-specific in language but there areother forms of arousal besides sexualarousal that we know from it's not apleasant topic from reports uh followingsexual assault that you know oftentimesthe victim is demonized for having beenlubricated and they will say well thenpeople will presume that somehow theywanted that interaction and that's nottrue in those cases it's clear thatthose that the lubrication occurredindependent of libido type arousalexactly right okay so let's set thataside again unpleasant topic but onethat's important to to um to flagare there forms of non-libidotype arousallubrication that allow for non-painfulor even pleasurefulpenetrationthatare important to distinguish from thearousal based lubrication in other wordsI have to imaginethat women willhave sex and it can be pleasureful or atleast not painful and that might relatein some way to Baseline levels oflubrication and here we've been talkingabout lubrication mainly in the contextof arousal you know post-menopausalreductions in lubrication but are therealso postmenopausal reductions inBaseline lubrication are some people'svaginas just more lubricated atum I won't say at rest it's like ascientist in me um when um they'reasleep for instance I mean men arehaving erections in their sleep arewomen getting vaginal lubrications intheir sleep periodically my guess is yeswell they're definitely getting clitoralin engorgement right they're gettingclear engorgement there's been somestudies on that that they are alsogetting nocturnal tumescence right justlike men do as far as lubrication youknow the the data at least from what Iunderstand is like there is a protectivemechanism whereby women when whenthere's any sense that there may bepenetration that their body willimmediately start creating lubricationand that is productive to avoid you knowtrauma and injury there's also Baselinevaginal discharge that's completelynormal women will make physiologicdischarge in fact in our examinationswhen we examine we'll say normalphysiologic discharge because we see itthere's always discharge and it is um itcan be up to like five milliliters andso it's not a small amount it can happenit can be quite a lot it needs menstrualcycle dependent in terms of theviscosity and the yes it changes overthe cycle and it can be different incolor and different in thickness andthat's completely normal and I thinkthat's a real problem in the femininehygiene industryum you don't need to smell a certain wayor or reduce that discharge this is likecompletely normal healthy and you talkedabout chemistry and I know there's likenot a ton of data on this but there'slike pheromones right there's scentsthat are coming from you which areactually attractive to a partnerpotentially and and in whateverphysiologic you know I don't knowthere's not a lot of data on this butlike there is that part of it soum you know there's a lot of marketingtowards women that you're dirty youshould be smelling like peaches orwhatever and there's a lot of marketingmaybe this is generational thing but I Ilearned early on I think aboutbehavioral Neuroscience courses thatvaginal lubrications wereum part of the arousal response for bothum these were always framed in thecontext of heterosexual relationshipsbut both Partners let's just say bothPartners um because this could be ahomosexual female relationship too rightwe want to make the conversation asbroad as possibleum and that the odor let's just be frankhere um the odor and The Tasteum played a role in both arousal butalso the pair bonding response thatwould establish future arousal andanyone that's ever been in a um in arelationship that uh let's say you hadhealthy sexual relations I like to thinkhis experience I'm rememberingsomebody's smell or thinking aboutsomebody's smell and that itself can bevery arousing yes Partners even I'msmelling uh different articles of eachother's clothing and that being arousingso I mean this is the stuff of of realphysiology we're not we're not makingthis stuff up right but there is thereis a lot of marketing towards women thatthey should use douching or other thingsto clean themselves and it is it'sdamaging right it's actually one it canaffect the vaginal microbiome so theirpH is changing and that can affect youknow their risk for UTIs or bacterialvaginosis and um and and so they'rethey're buying these spending theirmoney on these things because they'rebeing told that they're not clean andthey come to the doctor saying oh I'myou know I think I have a STD but it'slike normal physiologic dischargeum and so I think it's important to saythat this is normal and and it's normalto have an odor that is distinct to youand that there's you know of course ifyou have like a fishy odor that may be asign of like a very strong new novelodor that wasn't there before that maybe a sign of a sexually transmittedinfection but if it's your general odorthat you've always had that's normalwhat about other infections like yeast"

            "text": "one of the more cryptic topics on theinternetnot because it isn't discussed butbecause I think that the Nuance of itisn't discussed often enough or in fulldepth so let's take the time we need umto parse thisI think that the simplest way to parseit is going to be from the anatomicalstandpointclitoral orgasm versus so-called G-spotor penetration-based orgasm but ofcourse penetration-based orgasm is alsoa bit of a misnomer because there can beclitoral stimulation by pelvic pressureor by digit we're talking about fingersit's digits because we're both in theMedical Science profession but we'retalking about fingers here or somethingelse right vibrator toy whatever I'm toefor it depends on how flexible you are Idon't know but the point beingum that I think the simplest way to goabout this is going to be to talk aboutthe distinction between clitoral orgasmand G-spot orgasmhowever those are achievedumand to also talk about this idea ofgraded versus absolute okay so this hasactual parallels to Neuroscience wherewe talk about communication betweenneurons being graded meaning it's kindof you know one level then a higherlevel than a lower level or all or nonerightum how should I say thisum it is clear in my life experience andobservation that there are multiplekinds of female orgasm those that aregraded and in some cases cumulative theysort of build towards a larger andlarger orgasm and then there are whatsome people have described as Cliff typeorgasms where there's a refractoryperiodI think that's a fair way to frame thisand clearly there are differentresponses to the orgasm response somepeople get sleepy some people getenergized some people it heightens theirdesire for more some people they need aa period of time in which um they becomehypersensitive to touchum so uh lots of different things goingon there psychologically physiologicallyumyeah tell us all of it so in terms oforgasm right I think it's important todistinguish that there is orgasm andthen there's different areas that youstimulate to achieve orgasm so somepeople will stimulate the clitoris isprobably the most reliable form ofstimulation that will achieve orgasm andwhen you look at the data and again youknow female sexual dysfunction data isnot super robust but what we find isthat about 85 percent of women requireclitoral stimulation in order to climaxso very few actually climax through justvaginal penetration alone and so this isyou know a real problem we're seeing onthe media that you know you you have sexand you penetrate and immediately womenare having orgasms that's not thereality for a lot of women and in termsof stimulation so like we've talkedabout throughout this podcast theclitoris is the homologue of the penisor the penises the homologous theclitoris however you want to say it goodon you for getting it both directionsyeah I probably would have screwed thatone up yeah so um so clitoralstimulation is just like penilestimulation for women that is veryreliable and there's a huge orgasm gapfor men it's pretty consistent that whenthey have a first time sexual encounter95 of men are having an orgasm when youlook at first-time sexual encounters forwomen with in heterosexual relationshipsit's about 45 to 50 percent are havingan orgasm and when you look athomosexual relationships of women it'sagain 90 so there's clearly some lackingin ninety percent ofum female homosexual interactions thatare first-time interactions 90 percentare having orgasm correct presumablybecause they understand the anatomy ofother by way of understanding theanatomy of self so there's a hugebut you know there's a huge gap and so Ithink to to bring it home is theclitoral stimulation is the mostreliable way and as you mentioned whenyou're stimulating vaginally you'reoften the clitoris is like a wishboneand it goes around the vagina and soyou're often stimulating those the Kurais what we call the legs I guess forlack of a better term of the clitorisand so you're stimulating that you'realso stimulating the clip the clitoralshaft which goes deep into the pelvisthe G-Spot isum is an area as a neurogenous Zonewhere it's kind of in the anterior wallof the vagina about two to threecentimeters in that's the location ofthese periathral glands called theskene's glands and they are analogous orhomologous to the male prostate so justlike some men have prostate play andenjoy pleasure from prostate stimulationsome women enjoy G-spot stimulation nowthat's not Universal right not all menenjoy prostate play and not all womenare going to be aroused by G-spotstimulation and so I think there's ahuge huge uh huge variety of ways youcan stimulate what stimulate anyone itcan be man or woman some people willhave orgasms through just nipplestimulation alone some will just hearsomething or see something and be ableto achieve an orgasm and it's it's sovaried from person to person and I thinkthat the big take home from this forpeople listening is like you have totalk to your partner and this is thehardest thing we never learned how totalk about sex like what do you likewhat do you not like and and don't takeit personally right like I think a lotof times people feel like you have toorgasm to have pleasure which may not bethe case for everybody and if it is youknow how do you prioritize that for yourrelationship so I don't know if I gotoff track there but that's kind ofum I think the the take-homes for thisand also the vaginal penetration it'sactually usually from cervicalstimulation not necessarily vaginalbecause the large density of innervationof the vagina is in the first outerthird of the vagina the the deepertwo-thirds of the vagina has has muchless Innovation and yet there is such athing as cervical orgasm so and thecervix being further up the vaginalCanalum is cervical orgasms specifically thewhat if the stimulation and act uh thefoci of an orgasm that starts in theback of the vagina is that yeah sostimulation of thethrough whatever means right and thatcan be pleasurable and lead to orgasmand again orgasm you know is is defineddifferently right but the one thing weknow is that there are pelvic floorcontractions which are measurable so youcan kind of tell that your partner ishaving an orgasm if you have a femalepartner because you can actually feelthose contractions right whether it's onyour digit or your organ or a sex toyokay super nerdy question hereum years ago when I worked on"

            "text": "about UTIs I got a lot of questionsabout urinary tract infections let'smake itrelated to both females and malesbecause yes males get urinary tractinfections females get them more femalesasked about urinary tract infections howcommon are they should they always betreated with antibiotics is cranberryreally a good treatment if so why arethere other things that are better is itrelates to the acidity or alkalinityumhow does one prevent getting UTIs canyou get them from swimming should youurinate after sextell us about UTIs and how not to getthem and how to get rid of them happy toso UTIs are very common in womenprobably up to 50 of women get at leastone UTI in their lifetime and up to athird of them get recurrent UTIs andwhat that means is they have two or morein six months or three or more in a yearnow this is common and so we'll see alot of it and it's not as until you'rehaving recurrent utsc you just have onea year or you have one every few yearsit's not a huge issue in men howeverUTIs are much less common and that'sbecause the urethra is longer so there'sless entry from the outside world intothe bladder which causes infections andsoum the when men go to UTI it'sconcerning like why is a man getting aUTI you know there's multiple reasonsthat it could happen but it should beinvestigated like so that you can makesure there's no anatomic abnormality orfunctional abnormality with a bladderthat's causing the UTIs in terms ofprevention there are kind of majorthings that are had in the guidelinesthat we all we all talk about so one ishydration so making sure you're drinkingabout two to three liters of fluidideally water a day because dilution isthe solution to the pollution right sodrinking more fluids is going to getthat bacteria and you're going to pee itout it's going to help keep not let itsit around in the bladder very oftenanother thing in women who have AlteredStates of estrogen whether it'spost-menopausal surgical menopause ormaybe have a reduced estrogen forpostpartum or other reasons but whatabout you in the second half of themenstrual cycle not necessarily forthose specific people but for thosespecific times but because it's prettyshort-lived I guess you could use it butum is vaginal estrogen so vaginalestrogen meaning estrogen that's appliedin the vagina either through a cream asuppository or a ring is is highlyeffective in reducing the occurrence ofrecurrent UTIs and this is because whenyou have low estrogen the pH in thevagina goes up and the pH in the vaginagoes up because there's less conversionof glycogen to lactobacilli and thenthose lactobacilla are preventative forUTIs so essentially you want to reducethe pH back to its normal acidic pH andvaginal estrogen is very effective atdoing that fact in our clinics willactually check a vaginal pH you know tosee if there is an indication that theirpH is too high that maybe they do needvaginal estrogen particularly aroundlike perimenopause because it's hard totell just by looking if they are reallyum heading into a lower estrogen Statesometimes and so that's very veryeffective and very very safe so when youlook at estrogen you know the theWomen's Health Initiative way back whensort of made a big stink about howestrogen is related to cancerhowever vaginal estrogen has never everbeen a reported breast cancer uterinecancer or any other blood clot any otheradverse event associated with vaginalestrogen you can get some breasttenderness some discharge those thingscan occur but the absorbed amountvaginally is so little that yourestrogen level barely goes up it doesn'teven reach pre-menopausal levels so itjust goes up very slightly in thebloodstream not enough to create anysort of abnormality so a vaginalastronaut is extremely safe and it'spretty affordable you could actually usecoupons if your insurance doesn't coverit through you know GoodRx or MarkCuban's pharmacy and get it very veryaffordably and it's very effective itdoes take about three months to work soyou know you have to be consistent youapply it about twice a week at nightsometimes three times a week and it'svery effective the ring you put in onceand it lasts for three months but sogenerally speaking that's the mosteffective option for low estrogen Statesother kind of simple things are tryingto make sure you're completely emptyingyour bladder so over a lifetime peoplecan develop some mild pelvic floordysfunction right not enough to createpain or discomfort but maybe they're notemptying completely right because maybethey used to hold their urine for longperiods of time when they were a kid ormaybe they're always hovering over thetoilet because they don't want to sit onit at work and over time that can createa little bit of mild dysfunction whichcan make it more difficult to completelyempty the bladder and when urine issitting in the bladder for long periodsof time it's basically food for bacteriato grow and so bacteria grows and thenyou get recurrent UTI so making sureyou're completely empty by sittingrelaxing on the toilet sometimes leaningforward and then maybe going a secondtime so standing up sitting back downgoing again and even for men sometimestrying to sit and see if you completelyempty because sometimes standing you'renot able to empty completely whoa a lotof men are gonna because they're these"

on having visitedmany male bathrooms in my lifetime andum just being in the world um that thatI assumed that men stood up in order toto urinate but there are a decentpercentage of men that sit down tourinate there are and in fact it'svariable like country and probably thereason it's become more interestinglatelyso a certain country was recentlysurveyed I think it was Germanyum but essentially this recent likepicked up by the media that Germans sitmore often to pee and so you know thenpeople like oh is this better for me tosit to pee or stand to pee and there'sthis whole big discussion on the mediabut the reason being is when you'resitting your pelvic floor is mostrelaxed and so if you're having anyissues emptying your bladder you'regonna pee better also if you have anenlarged prostate which I'm sure we'regoing to talk about prostate enlargementthat can sometimes allow you to developa little bit more abdominal pressurebecause you're sitting and you can leanforward to overcome sort of a blockageand and so there are some someindications were sitting is better butif you're peeing fine and you'restanding that's fine too I don't thinkyou have to I think it's just somethingthat you know in other countries they domore and here we don't and I don't thinkit's right or wrong it just depends onyour individual circumstancecanspermicides or condoms or both increasethe frequency of UTIs for females sospermicides absolutely so spermicides ifyour condom has spermicide on it oryou're using spermicides that is a knownrisk factor for UTIs other things I wantto touch on you did ask about cranberryso cranberry is actually in the AmericanUrological Association guidelines forprevention of recurrent UTIs in womennow how does cranberry work right likedo I just bring juice it's actually aspecific active ingredient in theCranberry which is calledproanthocyanidins or Pacs and in orderthey've actually looked at the amount ofPacs you need and what formulation soyou need 36 milligrams of Pacs in asoluble form so a lot of the supplementson the market will say that they're 36milligrams of Pacs but they're like thewhole Berry so they're using the theskin of the berry and the stem of theberry and that's not going to help youso you need to make sure that thesupplement you're using is a solubleform of the cranberry and it's actuallyvery very very effective at reducing therisk of UTIs so do you mean um capsuleslike a gel cap yeah it's a capsule thatyou take once a day and there is somealthough not as much data that if you'rehaving them around sex which some womendo always have post-coital UTIs that youcan take two on the day of sex and twoon the day after and that may be helpfulbut there's not a lot of data there butcertainly an option that you can trythat's pretty low risk so that's kind ofthe the guidelines now there's a ton ofother things that you can do to helpprevent that are kind of available andhave some data behind them so d-mannoseis one of them where you take you knowabout two grams a day of d-mannose andyou drink it and that actually helpsreduce UTI risk it's been studying asmall randomized controlled trial to beeffective and um and so those are kindof the bigger ones there's other thingsthat people use like probiotics butthere's a lot of heterogeneity as youknow in probiotics and what to take andare they really effective vaginally inthe Flora there so those are kind of thebig things and there is is actually alot of microbiome study and UTIs goingon actually at UCLA where they'relooking at the microbiome of people whoare more at risk for UTIs or evenoveractive blood or other conditionslike that and they're trying to figureout like is there something here that wecan Target or that we can figure out isis causing problems because sometimes wejust can't figure out why it's happeningin terms of wiping from front to backand swimming and peeing after sexthere's no good data on any of thosethings wiping from front to back I thinkit does create a little bit of likeshame like it's not a big deal if youwipe back to front as long as you're notlike you know as long as you've likecleaned yourself so to speak so I thinkit's less of an issue what we're talkingabout is you're referring to anycontamination from anal any bacteriaaround the ants right yeah right and alot of women who have recurrent UTIslike tend to come and feel very dirtylike there's something wrong with themthey're like oh I wash all the time I'mreally clean I'm really this and youknow it's not something they're doingit's probably a microbiome effect or ahormonal effect or you know there'ssomething going on that we need toinvestigate further it could also be ananatomical or functional problem whereyou're not emptying the bladdercorrectly so there's lots of differentfactors it could mean it's like veryinfrequent I would say like I've neverseen a patient who's dirty and that'sthe reason they're getting UTIsum perhaps even the opposite is truethey're cleaning too much based on whatyou told us earlier yeah and they'reeliminating the gut micro excuse me justrolls off the tongue um again no punintendedum perhaps it's there they areabolishing the local microbiome on theskin too much cleaning eliminates themicrobiome on the skin not that we don'twant to wash but when Sonnenberg was aguest on this podcast he said actuallykids can develop a very healthymicrobiome and general microbiomeoftentimes by sorry parents not washingtheir hands before eating if they'vebeen playing with soil outside or dirt alittle bit of that is actually healthypets actually offer microbiome supportthis is so weird I know it sounds yeahbut we have to imagine how we evolved asa species was not with antibacterialsoaps and um alcohol swabs everywhereand obviously we don't want infectionsbut over cleaning can disrupt themicrobiome which presumably can lead toUTI so perhaps someone who's cleaningexcessively is more at risk thansomebody who's cleaning a little lessabsolutely and actually the cleaning canirritate the dermis right so you canactually get contact dermatitis typesymptoms from over cleaning and sothat's one of the you know things like Idefinitely have a UTI I definitely haveone well no you don't but there's a hostof other things that it could be one ofthem could be that another very commonone that we already touched on is pelvicfloor dysfunction so very often pelvicfloor dysfunction just like you had painwith urination women can also developpain with urination that doesn't go awayand it can start where they had a UTIthat triggered the pelvic floor and thenthe pelvic floor just didn't relax butthe pain just triggered the pelvic floorto tense up and it didn't relax becauseagain we're not taught how to relax ourpelvic floor and and then they've doneabout pelvic floor dysfunction like whyis UTI not going away why does it keepcoming back and so that's another commonthing that we see in people who havequote unquote recurrent UTIs but don'treally have them to be clear Iexperienced the pain in urination as aconsequence of trying those damn keygoals that everyone's talking aboutstopping thatum was informative in two directions oneit relieved the pain very quickly sothat was good the other was I realizedthat it is possible to have a pelvicfloor that's neither hyper contractednor over relaxed and in some cases justnot doing anything for it is the bestcircumstance right so um and the onlyreason I mention that is becauseum obviously this discussion is notabout my pelvic floor this discussion isabout the fact that some people perhapsneedto clean less some people maybe more butprobably not based on what you said somepeople might need to strengthen theirpelvic floor some people might need torelax their pelvic floor and somepeople's pelvic floor is probably A-Okayyou know any discussion aboutum anything medical or you know"

I hosted afemale physician guest whooffered both sides of female oralcontraception discussed some of thebenefits discuss some of the risksI made the decision to post clips aboutboth on the internet and wow wow wow wasIsurprised but also frankly a bit shockedand then finallyum intrigued by how polarized thediscussion is around female oralcontraception and female contraceptionin generalso NuvaRing nor plant the pillbroad category of things there but forsake of discussion the pillEtcI mean it seemed that approximately 50percent of responses which seem to comemainly from womenwere of the this stuff is terrible itruined my life it ruins lives it umdestroys you it has immenseum risk and then the other halfseemed to say no there's reduced risk ofcertain forms of cervical cancerum this has allowed me uh the you knowsexual choices and lifestyle that Iprefer without risk of pregnancy I meanit wasastonishing to the point where I thoughtwow if only I could post both Clipssimultaneously soum obviously I don't know what theanswer is um but I do know that this isamong the more polarizing topicsavailable for discussionum so what is the story meaning what arethe data about oral contraception why somuch controversy and what's the realdeal here yes so it is a very polarizingtopic and there is abundance dataabundant data in fact we even did astudy and again this isum not like high quality evidence but welooked at Reddit threads and we lookedat sexual dysfunction specifically lowlibido orgasmic difficulties and we likeread hundreds of threads and we did likea qualitative analysis in females to seelike what are people talking about andproblems with oral contraceptives andantidepressants leading to low libidoand and being very like as you describevery like this has ruined my life wasvery common and so the theory is thatyou know taking oral contraceptivesincreases the amount of sex hormonebinding globulin which bindstestosterone and estrogen and thatactually makes testosterone lessavailable which is as we've talked abouta very important hormone for desire andso in some subset of people they'reseeing very significant consequences oftaking oral contraceptives now I thinkthat there is you know we don't knowwhich women are going to have thisproblem and we don't know how it'sprobably a very small subset of peoplebut we do know that this does happen andthat when you measure shpg levelsthey're up and that even after they stopthe oral contraceptives you'll seeelevated shbg levels from Baseline forhow long you know for like at least fourmonths afterwards you'll still seeelevated shpg levels so we don't knowbut not infinitewe don't know we don't know yeah theendocrine system is weird because it itum we assume everything is a short-termeffect but there's some plasticity inthe system especially because it's aneuroendocrine system so yeah okay so Ithink yeah there's some neuroplasticitythere that occurs as well and so uh wedo see this and I think that the otherside of it is yeah absolutely oralcontraceptives are amazing right they'rethey're helpful for sexual Freedom sofor for preventing pregnancy for youknow for a lot of things andparticularly other conditions too likePCOS and and other problems oralcontraceptives are amazing and they'vechanged uh you know Gynecology andmanagement of these women for you knowin in a very positive way and so I thinkyou know yes I do think that there isoral contraceptive related sexualdysfunction usually low-dose estrogensort of contraceptives are the culprituh but you know I think that it's it'sagain the data female sexual respectliterature is just not as robust as malesexual dysfunction literature I saw alot of comments about how oralcontraception had led to depressive-likesymptomsum or just kind of a hedonia and apathynot just lower libido I can imagine howthat would be the case through theelevated sex hormone binding globulinwhich is you know preventingtestosterone estrogen fromum being free right literally andexerting their effects on not just thebody but the brain but is there anyevidence that oral contraception candisrupt no transmitters I'm not aware ofany I don't thinkknowledgeuh well it sounds to me likeoral contraceptionfor women because that's where wenormally hear about it it sounds likethere's a varied response and it'shighly individual I certainly hadpartners that love the pill or at leastdidn't seem to mind it I've had somethat hated it and like it's like no waytried that never willum or you know just went with otherforms of contraception or for whateverreason we're not using contraception soit seems to me thatthere's a lot of variation out there howdoes one explore that without risk ofpermanent damage it sounds like trulypermanent damage is unlikelyumyou know what are the other options youknow is the ringum uh copper IUDum so any sort of long-acting hormonalcontraceptive we've seen we've we that'swhat we counsel patients on is ifthey're having issues with oralcontraceptives even if they come in withpelvic pain and they're on oralcontraceptives I'll tell them you knowwhat just stop because maybe the enginethe effect of on the Androgen receptorsor estrogen receptors is affecting youknow the lubrication or other thingswe're not sure but you know why don'tyou stop it and go get a long-actingcontraceptive method like an IUD like anIUD and our IUD is our IUD safe and herewe should probably say Okay copper IUDis one form you want to mention a few ofthe other forms so I don't prescribeiuds but generally speaking they're verysafe of course there's risk with anysort of you know it's a procedure you'reinserting an IUD so there's obviouslysome small risks associated with it butit is safe and effective form ofcontraception people are wondering whythe copper IUD is an effective form ofcontraception copper is like the thirdrail for sperm as I understand it somuch so that um I was able to find someevidence for this in the medicaltextbooks thatum in the old days as I sayum prostitutes who wanted to avoidpregnancy would put copper pennies intheir vagina really oh now I don'trecommend that to anyone and uh pleaseand um I don't think it's a foolproofform of of uh contraception but there isevidence that that um did happen sowhich is amazing that means that peoplesomehow figured out the copper spermrelationship which isn't a good one forthe sperm and deduced from that ofbehavior yeah that'sI think it's just an interesting medicalfactoid yeahI can tell you want to move on from thistopic so we willum before discussing prostate and

            "text": "been incredibly generous with your timeand information here thank you so Ireally appreciate it as I'm sure ourlisteners do as wellanal sexyou recently did a post describing themultiple reasons why women do or do nothave anal sex yes very interesting postvery interesting study that you coveredyeah and you um explained it veryclearlyum I'm guessing there arerelatively few but perhaps some otherstudies as well about thisum let's talk about anal sex and uhmaybe if you could just offer some ofthe the key bullet points that you'velearned from the literature and fromyour clinical practiceum you know how frequent is itum uh with protection without protectionhow safe is itumyou know what are the different reasonspeople do it that might seem like a kindof a silly question but it turns outwhen it comes to this topic it's thereare interesting data yeah yeahum educate us so anal sex let's talkabout it um well when you when you talkabout anal sex the reason people it'sbecome more and more common let's sayit's more and more heterosexual couplesare doing it we know that malehomosexual couples are having anal sexand I think the one thing is that it'ssafe in terms of pregnancy right you'renot going to get pregnant from anal sexwhich is one of the reasons people doengage in anal sex do you think that'sthe reason people are doing it morefrequently no I think that's one of thereasons that people one of the reasonsbut in general the issue with anal sexis that people forget to use protectionlike a condom for example becausesexually transmitted infections areactually more likely with anal sex thanthey are with vaginal penetrativeintercourse because the anal tissue isvery thin and friable so when youpenetrate the anus particularly if youhave any trauma you can have you knowyou can have blood loss and that bloodloss can then easily more easilytransmit sexually to the infection soit's really important to use a condomand use adequate lubrication the anusdoes not make any of its endogenouslubrication you have to use lubricantthe other interesting thing about analsex is that the anus pH is differentfrom the vaginal pH so you want to usespecific lubricants that are ISO osmolarto anal pH so you can actually look upanal lubricants and we could talk aboutlubricants but generally there iswater-based silicone-based oil-basedlubricants water-based are the mosteasily accessiblesilicone based are a little moreslippery and lasts a little longer andoil based also last longer but are notgood freeze with condoms so definitelyusing lubricants and always kind ofmaking sure to be in the context ofcourse of being consensual but also likenever for course always take your timeand those things are really important toavoid trauma because trauma can happenand usually it's not severe trauma rightit's not going to create long lastingproblems but it is you know inconvenientuncomfortable and probably we're notseeing as much of it because they're notcoming to the emergency room if they'rehaving issues unless it's really seriousso I think it's really important one toprevent from a sexually transmittedinfections to to be thoughtful andcautious and sometimes it requires somepreparation if you're going to penetratean anus it's gonna you know you're notgonna start with a a large girth itemyou're going to start with somethingsmaller and kind of work your way upum and then I think ultimately whypeople have anal sex so as I mentionedearlier the prostate is you know highlyinnervated and can be a source ofpleasure so some people enjoy thatparticularly men may enjoy analpenetration women as well may enjoy analpenetration because of the innervationaround there the pelvic floorum and and you know so that's certainlyreasonable to do so as far as why peopleengage in anal sex so sometimes it'sbecause as I mentioned they're trying toavoid vaginal penetration either toavoid pregnancy or maybemenstruation or other reasons sometimesit's because people want to do somethingspecial with their partner like theyfeel like this is my special thing withthis partner that I do with them and soit may be something kind of like a giftor something like that sometimes it'salmost like they feel like they um theyhave to and this particular story that Ilooked at there's actually not a lot ofstudies on why people engage in anal sexand this particular study that I hadtalked about on my channel or myInstagram was talking about why they'vespecifically recruit drug users and so alot of people had used drugs prior tousing to engaging in anal sex and Ithink that that's not ideal you alwayswant to be kind of in the right State ofMind for consent andum and safety purposes and so um thosewere kind of the common reasons whatabout infection not related to sexuallytransmitted infectionum my presumption is there is a higherrisk with anal sex than there is withotherum other you know vaginal intercourseoral sex Etcum but is there evidence for thatum not necessarily it's more aboutsexually transmitted infectionsit's rare you can sometimes I mean therare things that people have kind ofcommented on like anal incontinencetemporarily or things like that veryrareum mostly it's it's just sexuallytransmitted infections because you knowyou can't have more it's more easy tocreate bleeding through anal sex ifyou're not careful and are people doingenemas before anal sex to preventbacterial infection or is that just likeit's a kind of some people areI think it's you knowyou know for their evacuated fullythere's some you know media articlesabout like what you should eat before tokind of keep your gut you know healthyand avoid kind of loose stools andthings like that but generally speakingyou know there's there's lots of thingsyou can look up to make it safe andhealthyagain I'm sure some people are listeningto this and they're maybe they've turnedit off already butum and I think we can expect a variedresponse to this discussion but it'shappening out thereapparently with an increasing frequencyyes and I don't know if that's becauseof the increasing availability ofpornography where it's visualized moreor ifum I don't really know why but we doknow that there's more going on inheterosexual couples than prior as afinal category of question"
