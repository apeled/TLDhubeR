            "text": "And the specific question is,\nwhy is fluoride in our water,and how much is it harming us?OK, well, that might seem\nlike a short question,but there's actually a\nlot to that question.And I want to be very clear,\nby posing the question, howmuch is it harming\nus, it impliesthat fluoride is harming us.And I'd want to be very clear.The degree to which fluoride\ncan harm you or not harm youdepends on how\nmuch of it happensto be in the water or\ntoothpaste or some other thingthat you're consuming, OK?So this is very important.I don't want the question to\nseem like a leading questionto imply that fluoride is\nnecessarily harming us,because as I'm\nabout to tell you,there are clear benefits of\nfluoride for tooth strengthand for warding off cavities.But if you get too much\nfluoride into your system,it is dangerous.It is a poison at\ncertain levels.So as you've probably\nheard before,the dose makes the poison.So let's take this\nseemingly simple questionand dissect it in two.The first part of\nthe question was,why is fluoride in our water?And believe it or\nnot, even that ishard to answer directly\nbecause here's what'shappening right now in 2024.There is a major lawsuit\nin the state of Californiato try and get fluoride removed\nfrom the drinking water.The outcome of that case is\nstill yet to be determined.But the case was filed\nby a group of individualswho strongly believe that\nfluoride at any concentrationin the drinking water is bad.Why would they say that?And what is their evidence?And how strong is that evidence?Well, there is some evidence\nthat if levels of fluoridein drinking water exceed\na certain threshold,it can cause problems with\nthyroid hormone functionand perhaps even certain\naspects of brain function.Again, if the levels\nexceed a certain threshold.So in the state of\nCalifornia, thereis a major lawsuit\nto try and getfluoride removed from\nthe drinking water.Now, at the same time,\nmeaning right now,there is also a major lawsuit\nin the United States--this one taking place\nin Buffalo, New York--whereby citizens\nare suing the citybecause they insist\nthat there is notenough fluoride in the water.And they are suing for damages\nbased on the dental healthneeds of their children that\ndid not, in their opinion,get enough fluoride\nin the drinking water.So I'm telling you\nabout all of thisbecause the question, again, was\nwhy is fluoride in our drinkingwater?And believe it or not, there\nare certain states in the UnitedStates, certain areas\nof the United States,where the fluoride levels in\nthe drinking water are low,are zero, perhaps.That's what the lawsuit\nin Buffalo is about.And by the way,\nthe city of Buffalomay have now corrected\nthe amount of fluoridein the water, taking it\nfrom zero to something.Whether or not it was actually\nzero is still debatable.But I think you're\nstarting to get the point,that there is a wide,\nwide divergence in termsof how safe people\nfeel about havingfluoride in drinking water.Some people want it\nand are suing citiesbecause they feel there\nwasn't enough of itin their drinking water.And others don't want any\nfluoride in their drinkingwater, and they're suing\ncities because of that.So this is a really barbed-wire\ntopic, as I like to say.It's one that no\nmatter how closeyou get to it, whatever\nangle you look at it,you're likely to get\nstuck a little bit.It's going to be a\nlittle bit painful.OK, why is fluoride in\nsome drinking water at all?Let's set aside the levels\nand just answer that question.Well, in an upcoming\nepisode of the Huberman Labpodcast about oral health.I'll get into this\nin a lot more detail.But fluoride is a really\ninteresting compoundwith respect to oral health.And here's why.Your teeth, believe\nit or not, are alwaysin a state of either\ndemineralizationor remineralization.Those are tricky words to say,\ngo ahead and try and say it.Demineralization,\nremineralization.So I'm going to refer to them as\n\"demin\" for \"demineralization\"and \"remin\" for\n\"remineralization.OK, your teeth are always\nin one state or the other,or one state predominates\nversus the other.Now, a cavity in your mouth\noccurs when bacteria--in particular,\nstreptococcus mutans,sometimes called strep mutans--feeds on sugars in\nyour mouth and then,as a byproduct of\nthat feeding, createsacids that then erode the\nenamel and deeper layersof your teeth.In other words, it\ndemineralizes the tooth.Now, I just told\nyou that your teethcan be in a state of demin\nor remin at any moment.The way that your teeth remin,\nthe way they remineralizeand can potentially fill in\nlittle cavities that have notyet made it to the deeper\nlayers of your teeth,is through a process that\ninvolves the constructionof crystals from minerals--that's why it's called\nremineralization--and get this.This really wild.These minerals\nactually stack togetherin very organized\nlittle sequences,kind of like LEGO blocks.And the critical element\nwithin those blocksis something called\nhydroxyapatite.I love that it has the\nword \"appetite\" in itbecause we're talking\nabout oral health.That's the normal process.Fluoride was discovered,\nnot because it's a vitamin,not because it's an\nessential nutrient.In fact, at high concentrations,\nit's actually a poison.I'll tell you a story about\nthat in a moment, whereI was actually poisoned\nby fluoride at the dentistwhen I was a kid, in large\npart due to my own error.Fluoride, it was\ndiscovered, can actuallyget inside of those LEGO\nchain-like crystals,the building of those, and\nform bonds between themthat are actually stronger than\nthe hydroxyapatite bonds thatwould normally form.In other words, if you consume\nfluoridated water or usetoothpaste with\nfluoride, especiallyif you do this when you're a\nkid, what ends up happeningis that the crystals and\nthe mineralization structureof the teeth becomes\nultrastrong, meaningsupraphysiologically\nstrong, which then limitsthe ability for\nthat strep mutansand the acid strep mutans\nproduces when it eats sugarto erode the enamel\nof your teethcausing what we\nrefer to as cavities.OK, so I went and asked several\ndentists and a periodontistabout, why is fluoride\nin drinking water?Why is fluoride in toothpaste?And they, of course,\ngave me the explanationthat I just gave you, which is a\nchemical mechanical explanationor rationale.However, most of the\nthings for our health,such as the foods we eat, the\namount of exercise that we do,are not naturally put into\nour environment, right?But tap water, which goes out\nto everyone who consumes itfrom the tap, is basically\na government or localgovernment-supplied resource.And basically, the\nrationale was--and I believe this took\nplace first in the 1950s--was, OK, given the potential\nfor fluoride to makesupraphysiologically\nstrong teeth, what can wedo to reduce the\ncavities and toothdecay that would occur in\nchildren and adult populations?Let's put fluoride in\nthe drinking water.So that's what they did.They did not do\nthis, I was told,because it was necessarily the\nbest way to take care of teethand avoid cavities.It turns out there are\na bunch of other thingsthat you can do, even if you\nconsume no fluoridated wateror toothpaste.There are things that you can\ndo to enhance the mineralizationstate of your teeth, even\nfill in cavities, providedthose cavities haven't\nmade it into the deeperso-called dentine\nlayers of the teeth.I'll get into all of this\nin that future episode.But what the US and other\ngovernments decided--this, of course, varies\nacross the world,to the extent to which there's\nfluoride in the drinking wateror not-- was that by putting\nfluoride in the drinking water,they could prevent a\nlarge amount of toothdecay and cavities that\nwould otherwise occur.It was, and remains, a\nfairly low-cost approachfor these cities to introduce\nfluoride to the drinking water.And that's why fluoride\nis in drinking water.It is to try and create\nsupraphysiologically strongteeth.And, indeed, every\nsingle dentist Ispoke to, including\nfunctional dentists.I spoke to periodontists.I spoke to several\ndentists, rangingfrom, let's call them, more\n\"traditionally trained\"dentists to more, let's call\nthem, \"alternative dentists.\"All of them agree that at a\nchemical mechanical level,fluoride creates stronger teeth.However, every\nsingle one of themalso acknowledged\nthat the bonds thatare created in those\nmineralization chains, as I'mreferring to--I realize that's not\nthe technical term--is not the normal hydroxyapatite\nbonds that would form.They are stronger than the\nbonds that would normally form.They are structurally different.If you look at them down what's\ncalled an electron microscope,you'll see that they're\nstructurally different.And some, not all of the\ndentists, I spoke to said,yeah, it would be\nbest to remineralizethe teeth to fill\nin any cavitiesthat initially have formed--again, not down to\nthe deep layers,but they could still\nbe filled in naturallythrough the building up of those\nhydroxyapatite natural bonds.But they acknowledged that many\npeople, perhaps most people,don't take adequate care of\ntheir mouths and their teeth.So they understood the\nrationale of putting fluorideinto drinking water.And of course, that's\nalso why fluoride isin many, not all toothpastes.OK, so I'm hoping that\nclearly answers for youthe question of why there is\nfluoride in our drinking waterat all.At least in most\nAmerican cities,there is fluoride in\nthe drinking water,although this\nlawsuit in Buffalo,I guess soon to be determined,\nwill probably tell uswhether or not, indeed,\nthere was a total lackor a partial lack of fluoride\nin the drinking water there.I'm presuming that the\naccusation is true.But I don't actually\nknow that to be true.I just know that there's\na lawsuit that exists.If you Google that, you can see\nsome YouTube videos about it.There's information\nabout this happening.There are a bunch\nof angry parents.And I'm sure there are angry\nparents on the other side.And I don't know what the\nkids are saying, but hopefullyno matter what, they're saying\nthem through healthy teeth.OK, now, the second\nhalf of the questionwas, how much is the fluoride\nin drinking water harming us?I'm going to answer this\nquestion very specifically.The person asks, how much is\nthe fluoride in our drinkingwater harming us?Well, I already told you\nways in which it is helpingthe strength of your teeth.That's not debated.Again, there might\nbe some dentiststhat say, oh, the bonds\nthat are formed by fluorideare different than the\nones that are naturallycreated with no fluoride,\nand so there mightbe some debate about that.But all of them acknowledge\nthat those bondsand the mineralization\nof the teethis stronger with fluoride.They understand and\nagree with the rationale,even if they don't necessarily\nagree with the practiceas the best practice.How much is fluoride in\ndrinking water harming you?Well, there are two\nthings you need to ask.One is, how much fluoride\nare you actually drinking?Because it turns out\nthere's a tremendous rangeof fluoride concentrations\nin tap water,depending on what\ncity you live in.Now, I did an entire episode\nof the Huberman Lab podcastabout water.We talked about distilled\nwater versus spring water.We talked about\nhydrogenated water.We talked about alkaline water.We talked about all\nof those things.And we did talk about fluoride.And one of the\nkey takeaways whenyou're thinking about\nfluoride in drinking wateris to know that if fluoride\nconcentrations in drinkingwater are too high or--and this is a very\nimportant \"or\"--you're consuming a lot of\na particular water thatcontains even low levels\nof fluoride, well, there'sthe potential-- and, again,\nI want to highlight the word\"potential\" here.I don't want to cause alarm.That the fluoride is causing\ndisruptions to thyroid hormoneoutput or on the receptor end,\nin other words disruptionsto thyroid hormone metabolism\nand usage in the body.OK, I want to be\nreally clear here.I don't want people\nto think, oh, fluoridedestroys your thyroid hormone.It's the dose that\nmakes the poison.It depends on how much.Now, the Center for Disease\nControl have set a recommendedlevel of 0.7mg/l of fluoride in\ndrinking water as the level--and here I'm paraphrasing-- that\ncan help prevent tooth decayand promote good oral health\nand that they have deemed safe.But if you want to know how much\nfluoride is in your drinkingwater, whether or not it is\nabove, at, or below that value,you need to get your\ntap water tested.Now, fortunately,\nthere are websitesthat can tell you\nhow much fluorideis in your drinking water.And if you trust the\ndata on those websites,you can simply put\nthe city you livein into one of those\nwebsites, and you'llget the information back.I'll provide a few links\nto those different websitesin the Show Note captions\nfor this episode.We also provided those links\nin the Show Note captionsfor the episode on Water.And then you can see.Are you adjusting\nthe level of fluoridein your drinking water\nthat's deemed safe,less than that value,\nor more than that value?But keep in mind\nthat if you drinka little bit, a moderate\namount, or a lotof fluoridated\ndrinking water, you'regoing to be consuming either\nmore or less fluoride.Just because there's\na concentration that'sbeen deemed safe by the\nCenter for Disease Controldoes not actually tell\nyou whether or not,OK, if you're drinking half\na gallon of tap water a dayversus a gallon versus\njust a couple of cups,whether or not you\nare in that safe zone.And of course, this is going\nto vary by body weight.If you're a small child,\nthose lower levels of fluorideare going to equate to a\nlarger total amount of fluorideas seen by the\nvolume of the body.If you think about\nthis, everything'sby body weight volume.And this is why drug dosages\nare most typically calculatedas a function of pounds or\nkilograms of body weight.Not everybody gets the\nsame dose of every drug.And if you're a\nvery large person,maybe you can tolerate\nmore fluoride.As I mentioned before,\nhigh levels of fluoridehave been shown to disrupt\nthyroid metabolism.It has also been\nhypothesized-- again,this is still highly\ndebated-- hypothesizedto be neurotoxic under\ncertain conditions.That is, toxic to neurons.It can kill neurons at\ncertain concentrations,not necessarily\nthe concentrationspresent in your drinking water.A lot of the evidence that\nfluoride is neurotoxicis from so-called\nin vitro studies.So studies done\neffectively in a dish,although there is\nsome in vivo evidencethat it can cause a\nneurotoxicity, a.k.a.neurodegeneration.So I think when it comes\nto the topic of fluoride,people tend to bin out into\nnot concerned and simply wantfluoride to strengthen\ntheir teeth; mildly concern,kind of keeping an eye on\nthis stuff-- you know, OK,fluoride doesn't\nsound great for me,but as long as the\nconcentrations aren't too high,some people will say, I've been\ndrinking tap water my wholelife and I feel great, my teeth\nare strong, and my brain works,and my thyroid seems fine--and then people who are\nvery, very concernedabout fluoride at any\nconcentration in their drinkingwater.Hence, the lawsuit in\nCalifornia and other lawsuitsaround the country.So I believe that when we're\ntalking about fluoride,you really need to\nthink about the dosages.And you need to ask yourself\nwhich one of those threecategories you fall into.Now, if you are\nconcerned about fluoride,it does not necessarily mean\nthat you can't drink tap water.The suggestion simply would\nbe to filter that tap water.And during the episode\nI did on water,I talked about a number\nof different filtrationapproaches.Many of those filters\nwill filter out fluoride,and you can simply look\nup water filters thateliminate or reduce fluoride.And then some people have\nenough disposable incomeand/or are concerned\nenough about fluoridein their drinking water that\nthey will purchase or createvery extensive, very\nthorough filtration systemsto completely eliminate fluoride\nfrom their drinking water.So you'll find different\nranges of concern.Again, aside from the data\nof high fluoride levelsbeing disruptive to\nthyroid hormone pathwaysand possibly\nneurotoxic, I personallyam somebody who filters the\ndrinking water I consume outof the tap, unless that\nis I'm going to boil waterwith it for making things like\nloose leaf yerba mate whichis one of my favorite\ndrinks, although lately Idrink this cold brew Mateina\nyerba mate, which by the way,is made with purified\nwater, no fluoride.And so on and so forth.But if I'm making rice\nor I'm making pastaor I'm making oatmeal and\nI need to use tap water,I don't worry about removing\nthe fluoride from that water.However, if I'm\ngoing to drink water,if I'm going to mix an element\nelectrolyte pack in or justdrink a glass of water\nor go out on a hikeand take some\nwater with me, I douse a water filter, either a\nfilter that fills from the topand then seeps down, the ones\nyou put in the refrigerator.Or I recently purchased\na whole house filterfor the drinking\nwater taps in my houseso that it does remove\nall the fluorideand removes some other\ncontaminants as well.So it's going to depend\non your level of concern,and it's going to depend\non your disposable incomeand any number of other things.And I must say that\nevery once in a while,I'll drink a little bit of\ntap water out of the tapwithout any concern about\nfiltering the fluoride.I'm not somebody who gets hyper\nconcerned about these things.But I do understand\nwhy some peopledo get hyper concerned about\nthese things, especiallypeople who've read up on\nfluoride and some of the healthconcerns of consuming\ntoo much fluoride,because I also find it very\nlogical and understandablethat as people\nlearn more about howa particular substance might be\nharming their brain or bodilyhealth that they will\nbecome more concernedabout consuming that substance.It just stands to reason.So what am I suggesting?I suggest that you figure\nout how much fluorideis in your tap water.I suggest that you,\nthen, make a decisionas to whether or not\nto filter that wateror not before drinking it.And then, of course,\nyou have to makea decision about what sort\nof financial investmentyou're willing to make\nto filter that water.You can find a list of different\nprice ranges of water filtersin the Show Note captions\nin the Water episode.You may also want to\nwatch that episodeand go to that timestamp.And there's an\nenormous range there.I want to be very clear.I don't have a\nfinancial relationshipto any of those\nfiltration mechanisms.Again, some people\nhave $0 to devoteto that process of\ntaking the fluoride outof their water and\nother contaminants.Some people have many, many\ntens of thousands of dollars.So it really just depends\non your disposable incomeand your level of concern.But if you were to ask\nme, I would say, yeah,I think given that the cost\nof most of the filters thatcan remove most of\nthe fluoride is low,and given that there is some\nhealth concern of consumingtoo much fluoride, why\nnot just remove fluoridefrom the drinking water?And then if you say, well,\nwon't that weaken my teeth,then I would say, well,\nwatch the episode that'ssoon to come out on oral health\nbecause it's going to explaina lot of approaches, including\nfluoride-containing toothpastebut some other\nnonfluoride-containingtoothpaste and other\nthings that onecan do that the community of\nprofessionally-trained dentistsall agree can really help\nimprove the mineralizationstate of your teeth and, indeed,\ncan fill in cavities that havebegun to form but\nhaven't yet made itto the deeper layers of\nyour teeth, and on and on.Now, I do have a brief\nstory about fluoridethat I'd be remiss if I didn't\ntell you, which essentiallyshows that fluoride is\ndesigned to strengthen teethbut is also indeed a poison.So when I was a kid, I had\na lot of dental issues.I didn't consume much sugar.My mother, fortunately,\nwas good about not lettingus consume too much sugar.But for whatever reason, my\nmouth was kind of a mess.I'd brush.I'd floss.I would do all these\nthings, but I actuallyhad my adult teeth come\nin behind my baby teeth,so it didn't push\nout my baby teeth.So not only did I not\ncollect from the toothfairy, which I only recently\ndiscovered isn't real.But how would I know?Because the tooth\nfairy never showed upbecause all of my adult teeth\ncame in behind my baby teeth.So I had to have all of my\nbaby teeth pulled on the top.So I did not have\na good relationshipto the dentist as a\nlocation or a person.In fact, they had to tell\nme not to bite the dentist.By the way, I haven't bitten\na dentist in a long time.So hopefully, my dentist,\nif watching this,is not too concerned.I do get twice a year cleanings.I think every dentist agrees\nthat's a good thing to do.Some people may need less.Some people may need more.But how do you know?You need to go to a\ndentist to find out.Back to the story\nabout fluoride.I started going to\nthe dentist quitea bit because of all\nthese dental issuesthat I had as a kid.And what they used to do--I don't know if they\ndo this anymore--but what they used to\ndo is they give youthese little trays, which\nare kind of like mouth guardsthat you would use\nfor boxing or hockeyso your teeth don't\nget knocked out.And they would fill those trays\nwith this jelly-like stuff thatcontained fluoride, and\nthey put it on the topand on the bottom.And the stuff just--oh, little bits of it\nwould seep onto your tongueand your throat.And it was so sour.It was so awful.And they'd seat me\nin this little wickerchair in front of a television\nand turn on cartoons,as if that was supposed\nto make me forget howawful the whole experience was.If anything, it probably just\ncreated a Pavlovian conditionedresponse to hate cartoons,\nwhich I suppose did not work,because I liked cartoons then.I don't watch them now.Truly, I don't watch them now.So I sit down on\nthis wicker chair.I've got the fluoride in my\nteeth with these two trays.And I'm just hating\nthis whole process.I think I must have been\nabout five or six years old.So I decide, in my\ninfinite wisdom,to just swallow all\nthe fluoride paste.So I start sucking it down\nthrough these mouth guards.I can feel it going back into\nmy throat, and it's sour,and it's stinging.It's awful, but I'm thinking,\nOK, I'm just going to do this.And I'm going to sit there.I'm basically going\nto beat the test.And so I drink all\nthis fluoride paste.And then, of course,\nI got immensely sickwithin about three minutes.I stood up.I turned around and puked\nall over the wicker chair.I think that was deliberate.Actually, looking back,\nit was deliberate.And puke all over\nthe wicker chair.My mom comes running in.What happened?What did you do to him?She was very protective of me.Thanks, Mom.What did you do to him?And then I said I just\nswallowed the stuff.They wanted to do it again, and\nI stopped doing the fluoridetreatment at that point.Why did I vomit?Well, I vomited because\nfluoride is, indeed,a poison at high concentrations.Now, do I tell you\nthat story to makeyou afraid of giving your\nkids fluoridated toothpasteor fluoridated water?No, by all means, do\nwhat you think is bestfor you and for your children.For me, however,\nI've made some effortto avoid fluoride toothpaste.I do go to the dentist, as I\nmentioned, about once a year.I confess, during the\npandemic, it was probably less,as they were busy, and it was\nhard to schedule, et cetera.I've had very, very few cavities\nin my adult life, hardly any.And my gum health\nis very strong,et cetera, et cetera, largely\nthrough taking on protocolsthat I'm going to describe\nin the Oral Health episodeand that were recommended\nto me by friendswho are both dentists and other\nfriends who are periodontists.Because, again, there\nare a lot of thingsthat we can do to strengthen\nour teeth in natural ways,by building up those\nhydroxyapatite bonds,which are the natural\nbonds that teeth form.And yes, believe\nit or not, beingable to reverse\nsome early-formedcavities, as long\nas they haven'tmade it deep into the tooth.Also things like using\na soft toothbrush,because if you brush too hard,\nif you take that approachand you're going to brush\nyour teeth really hard,get them really, really\nclean, yes, you'llscrape off all the biofilm,\nyou'll avoid tartar build up,but you can really cause\nsome tenting of the gumtissue above the teeth and those\nlittle recesses back in therewhere bacteria get in.And there's now a lot of\nreally strong evidence showingthat some of that bacteria can\ntranslate into cardiac disease,can translate into\nmetabolic disease,and maybe even into\nsome neurologic disease.So it's serious stuff.Oral health is one of the most\nimportant areas of health.And it's one of the\nmost overlooked areasof oral health.And I think people generally\nfall into two categories.And I'll use these\ntwo categoriesto frame up the episode on\noral health that's coming.One category of\nperson seems reallybullish on their oral health.They're like, keep my\nteeth white and clean,and they floss and brush\ntwice a day, every day.And they use tooth whiteners and\nmouthwash and all those things.And the other category is\nkind of blas\u00e9 about it.Yeah, I brush my\nteeth in the morningso that my breath\ndoesn't kill every personI get into an interaction\nwith, and so on and so forth.But in reality, both\nthe group of peoplethat are doing an\nimmense number of thingsto try and keep their teeth\nwhite and their breath freshare, yes, doing things that\nare good for their oral health,but also, no doubt,\ndamaging their oral health,in particular the\noral microbiome, whichis absolutely critical.And then of course,\nthe other categoryof people that are\nneglecting their oral hygieneand are not taking mouthwashes\nand things like thatare also damaging their oral\nhealth but in different ways.So during the episode\non oral health,I'll spell out all the things\nthat you can do, most of which,by the way are completely\nzero cost, many of themactually will save you money,\nboth in the short and longterm, and can really\nhelp you improveyour oral microbiome, the\nstrength of your teeth,and reduce the number\nof cavities, maybe evenreverse cavities that\nhave begun to formand are not too deep\ninto the tooth yet,and in a really nice way, all of\nthat independent of your stanceon fluoride.Thank you for joining\nfor the beginning"
