            "text": "Andrew Huberman: [MUSIC PLAYING] Welcome to the Huberman Labpodcast, where we discuss science and\nscience-based tools for everyday life.I'm Andrew Huberman, and I'm a professor\nof neurobiology and ophthalmologyat Stanford School of Medicine.Today, my guest is Marc Andreessen.Marc Andreessen is a software engineer\nand an investor in technology companies.He co-founded and developed\nMosaic, which was one of thefirst widely used web browsers.He also co-founded and developed\nNetscape, which was one of theearliest widespread used web browsers.And he co-founded and is a general\npartner at Andreessen Horowitz,one of the most successful Silicon\nValley venture capital firms.All of that is to say that Mark\nAndreessen is one of the most successfulinnovators and investors ever.I was extremely excited to record this\nepisode with Marc for several reasons.First of all, he himself\nis an incredible innovator.Second of all, he has an uncanny ability\nto spot the innovators of the future.And third, Marc has shown over and\nover again the ability to understandhow technologies not yet even\ndeveloped are going to impact theway that humans interact at large.Our conversation starts off by discussing\nwhat makes for an exceptional innovator,as well as what sorts of environmental\nconditions make for exceptionalinnovation and creativity more generally.In that context, we talk about risk\ntaking, not just in terms of risk takingin one's profession, but about how some\npeople, not all, but how some people whoare risk takers and innovators in the\ncontext of their work also seem to takea lot of risks in their personal life and\nsome of the consequences that can bring.Then we discuss some of the most\ntransformative technologies that arenow emerging, such as novel approaches\nto developing clean energy, as wellas AI or artificial intelligence.With respect to AI, Marc shares\nhis views as to why AI is likely togreatly improve human experience,\nand we discuss the multiple rolesthat AI is very likely to have in\nall of our lives in the near future.Marc explains how not too long from now,\nall of us are very likely to have AIassistants, for instance, assistants that\ngive us highly informed health advice,highly informed psychological advice.Indeed, it is very likely that all of us\nwill soon have AI assistants that governmost, if not all, of our daily decisions.And Marc explains how, if done\ncorrectly, this can be a tremendouslypositive addition to our life.In doing so, Marc provides a stark\nargument for those that argue that AIis going to diminish human experience.So if you're hearing about and or\nconcerned about the ways that AI islikely to destroy us today, you are\ngoing to hear about the many differentways that AI technologies now in\ndevelopment are likely to enhanceour human experience at every level.What you'll soon find is that while\ntoday's discussion does center aroundtechnology and technology development,\nit is really a discussion abouthuman beings and human psychology.So whether you have an interest in\ntechnology development and or AI,I'm certain that you'll find today's\ndiscussion to be an important andhighly lucid view into what will soon\nbe the future that we all live in.Before we begin, I'd like to emphasize\nthat this podcast is separate from my"

            "text": "teaching and research roles at Stanford.It is, however, part of my desire\na nd effort to bring zero costto consumer information about\nscience and science-relatedtools to the general public.In keeping with that theme, I'd like to\nthank the sponsors of today's podcast.Our first sponsor is LMNT.LMNT is an electrolyte drink that has\neverything you need and nothing you don't.That means plenty of the electrolytes,\nsodium, magnesium, and potassium inthe correct ratios, but no sugar.The electrolytes and hydration are\nabsolutely key for mental health,physical health, and performance.Even a slight degree of dehydration can\nimpair our ability to think, our energylevels and our physical performance.LMNT makes it very easy to achieve\nproper hydration, and it does so byincluding the three electrolytes in the\nexact ratios they need to be present.I drink LMNT first thing in\nthe morning when I wake up.I usually mix it with\nabout 16 to 32oz of water.If I'm exercising, I'll drink one\nwhile I'm exercising, and I tend todrink one after exercising as well.Now, many people are scared off by the\nidea of ingesting sodium because obviouslywe don't want to consume sodium in excess.However, for people that have normal\nblood pressure, and especially forpeople that are consuming very clean\ndiets, that is consuming not so manyprocessed foods or highly processed\nfoods, oftentimes we are not gettingenough sodium, magnesium and potassium,\nand we can suffer as a consequence.And with LMNT , simply by mixing\nin water, it tastes delicious.It's very easy to get\nthat proper hydration.If you'd like to try LMNT , you can\ngo to drinklmnt, that's L-M-N-T,.com/huberman to claim a free element\nsample pack with your purchase.Again, that's drinklmnt.com/huberman.Today's episode is also\nbrought to us by Eight Sleep.Eight Sleep makes smart mattress\ncovers with cooling, heatingand sleep tracking capacity.I've spoken many times before on this\npodcast about the fact that sleep, thatis getting a great night's sleep, is\nthe foundation of all mental health,physical health and performance.When we're sleeping well,\neverything goes far better.And when we are not sleeping well\nor enough, everything gets farworse at the level of mental health,\nphysical health and performance.Now, one of the key things to getting a\ngreat night's sleep and waking up feelingrefreshed is that you have to control the\ntemperature of your sleeping environment.And that's because in order to\nfall and stay deeply asleep, youneed your core body temperature to\ndrop by about one to three degrees.And in order to wake up feeling\nrefreshed and energized, you wantyour core body temperature to increase\nby about one to three degrees.With Eight Sleep , it's very easy\nto induce that drop in core bodytemperature by cooling your mattress\nearly and throughout the night andwarming your mattress toward morning.I started sleeping on an Eight Sleep\nmattress cover a few years ago, andit has completely transformed the\nquality of the sleep that I get.So much so that I actually loathe\ntraveling because I don't have my EightSleep mattress cover when I travel.If you'd like to try Eight Sleep , you can\ngo to eightsleep.com/huberman and you'llsave up to $150 off their Pod 3 Cover.Eight Sleep currently ships\nin the USA, Canada, UK, selectcountries in t he EU and Australia.Again, that's eightsleep.com/huberman.And now for my discussion\nwith Marc Andreessen.Marc, welcome."

            "text": "Marc Andreessen: Hey, thank you.Andrew Huberman: Delighted to\nhave you here and have so manyquestions for you about innovation\nAI, your view of the landscapeof tech, and humanity in general.I want to start off by talking\nabout innovation from threedifferent perspectives.There's the inner game, so to speak,\nor the psychology of the innovator,or innovators, things like their\npropensity for engaging in conflictor not, their propensity for having a\ndream or a vision, and in particular,their innovation as it relates to some\npsychological trait or expression.So we'll get to that in a moment.The second component that I'm\ncurious about is the outer landscapearound innovators, who they place\nthemselves with, the sorts ofchoices that they make and also\nthe sorts of personal relationshipsthat they might have or not have.And then the last component is this\nnotion of the larger landscape thatthey happen to find themselves in.What time in history?What's the geography?Bay Area, New York, Dubai, etc.So to start off, is there a common\ntrait of innovators that you thinkis absolutely essential as a seed to\ncreating things that are really impactful?Marc Andreessen: Yeah.So I'm not a psychologist,\nbut I've picked up some of theconcepts and some of the terms.And so it was a great moment of delight\nin my life when I learned about the BigFive personality traits, because I was\nlike, aha, there's a way to actuallydescribe the answer to this question in\nat least reasonably scientific terms.And so I think what you're looking\nfor, when you're talking about realinnovators, like people who actually do\nreally creative breakthrough work, I thinkyou're talking about a couple of things.So one is very high in what's called\ntrait openness, which is one of theBig Five, which is basically just\nlike, flat out open to new ideas.And of course, the nature of trait\nopenness is trait openness meansyou're not just open to new ideas\nin one category, you're open tomany different kinds of new ideas.And so we might talk about the\nfact that a lot of innovators alsoare very creative people in other\naspects of their lives, even outsideof their specific creative domain.So that's important.But of course, just being open is not\nsufficient, because if you're justopen, you could just be curious and\nexplore and spend your entire lifereading and doing, talking to people\nand never actually create something.So you also need a couple of other things.You need a high level of\nconscientiousness, which isanother one of the Big Five.You need somebody who's really willing\nto apply themselves, and in our world,typically over a period of many years to\nbe able to accomplish something great.They typically work very hard.That often gets obscured because\nthe stories that end up getting toldabout these people are, it's just like\nthis kid, and he just had this idea,and it was like a stroke of genius.And it was like a moment in time and\nwas just like, oh, he was so lucky.And it's like, no, for most of\nthese people, it's years andyears and years of applied effort.And so you need somebody with an\nextreme, basically, willingness to defergratification and really apply themselves\nto a specific thing for a long time.And of course, this is why there aren't\nvery many of these people, there aren'tmany people who are high in openness and\nhigh in conscientiousness because to acertain extent, they're opposed traits.And so you need somebody\nwho has both of those.Third is you need somebody\nhigh in disagreeableness, whichis the third of the Big Five.So you need somebody who's just basically\nornery, because if they're not ornery,then they'll be talked out of their\nideas by people who will be like, oh,well, because the reaction, most people\nhave new ideas is, oh, that's dumb.And so somebody who's too agreeable\nwill be easily dissuaded to notpursue, not pulling the thread anymore.So you need somebody highly disagreeable.Again, the nature of\ndisagreeableness is they tend tobe disagreeable about everything.So they tend to be these very sort of\niconoclastic kind of renegade characters.And then there's just a table\nstakes component, which is theyjust also need to be high IQ.They just need to be really smart\nbecause it's hard to innovate inany category if you can't synthesize\nlarge amounts of information quickly.And so those are four basically\nhigh spikes, very rare traits thatbasically have to come together.You could probably also say they probably\nat some point need to be relatively lowon neuroticism, which is another of the\nBig Five, because if they're too neurotic,they probably can't handle the stress.Right.\nSo it's kind of this dial in there.And then, of course, if you're into the\nsort of science of the Big Five, basicallythese are all people who are on the far\noutlying kind of point on the normaldistribution across all these traits.And then that just gets you to, I\nthink, the sort of hardest topic ofall around this whole concept, which\nthere are very few of these people.Andrew Huberman: Do you think\nthey're born with these traits?Marc Andreessen: Yeah,\nthey're born with the traits.And then, of course, the traits are\nnot genetics, are not destiny, and sothe traits are not deterministic in\nthe sense of that just because theyhave those personality traits doesn't\nmean they're going to deliver greatcreativity, but they need to have those\nproperties because otherwise they're justnot either going to be able to do the\nwork or they're not going to enjoy it.Right.I mean, look, a lot of these people\nare highly capable, competent people.It's very easy for them to get,\nlike, high paying jobs in traditionalinstitutions and get lots of traditional\nawards and end up with big paychecks.And there's a lot of people at big\ninstitutions that you and I know well,and I deal with many of these where\npeople get paid a lot of money andthey get a lot of respect and they go\nfor 20 years and it's great and theynever create anything new, right?There's a lot of administrators, a\nlot of them end up in administrativejobs, and that's fine, that's good.The world needs that also, right?The innovators can't run\neverything because the rateof change would be too high.Society, I think, probably\nwouldn't be able to handle it.So you need some people who are on the\nother side who are going to kind of keepthe lights on and keep things running.But there is this decision that people\nhave to make, which is okay if Ihave the sort of latent capability\nto do this, is this actually whatI want to spend my life doing?And do I want to go through the\nstress and the pain and the traumaand anxiety and the risk of failure?And so, do I really want to?Once in a while you run into\nsomebody who's just like,can't do it any other way.They just have to.Andrew Huberman: Who's an example of that?Marc Andreessen: I mean, Elon's the\nparamount example of our time, andI bring him up in part because he's\nsuch an obvious example, but in partbecause he's talked about this in\ninterviews where he basically says,he's like, I can't turn it off.The ideas come, I have\nto pursue them, right?It's why he's like running\nfive companies at the same timeand, like working on a sixth.It's just like he can't turn it off.Look, there's a lot of other people who\nprobably had the capability to do it,who ended up talking themselves into or\nwhatever events conspired to put them ina position where they did something else.Obviously, there are people\nwho try to be creative, whojust don't have the capability.And so, there's some venn diagram\nthere of determinism through traits,but also choices in life, and then\nalso, of course, the situation inwhich they're born, the context within\nwhich they grow up, culture, what theirparents expect of them, and so forth.And so to kind of get all the way\nthrough this, you have to thread allthese needles kind of at the same time.Andrew Huberman: Do you think there are\nfolks out there that meet these criteria"

            "text": "who are disagreeable, but that can feign\nagreeableness, you know that can...?[BOTH LAUGH] For those just listening,\nMarc just raised his right hand.In other words, they can sort of,\nphrase that comes to mind maybe becauseI can relate to it a little bit, they\nsneak up through the system, meaningthey behave ethically as it relates\nto the requirements of the system.They're not breaking laws or breaking\nrules, in fact, quite the opposite,they're paying attention to the\nrules and following the rules untilthey get to a place where being\ndisagreeable feels less threateningto their overall sense of security.Marc Andreessen: Yeah, I mean, look,\nthe really highly competent peopledon't have to break laws, right?There was this myth that happened\naround the movie The Godfather , andthen there was this character, Meyer\nLansky, who's like, ran basicallythe Mafia 50, 60, 70 years ago.And there was this great line of like,\nwell, if Meyer Lansky had only appliedhimself to running General Motors, he\nwould have been the best CEO of all time.It's like, no, not really, right?The people who are great at\nrunning the big companies, theydon't have to be mob bosses.They don't have to break laws.They're smart and sophisticated enough\nto be able to work inside the system.They don't need to take the easy out.So, I don't think there's any\nimplication that they have to break laws.That said, they have\nto break norms, right?And specifically, this is probably\nthe thing that gets missed the most,because the process of innovating,\nthe process of creating somethingnew, once it works, the stories get\nretconned, as they say in comic books.So the stories get adapted to where\nit's like it was inevitable all along.Everybody always knew\nthat this was a good idea.The person has won all these\nawards, society embraced them.And invariably, if you were with them when\nthey were actually doing the work, or ifyou actually get a couple of drinks into\nthem and talk about it, it'd be like,no, that's not how it happened at all.They faced a wall of skepticism,\njust like a wall of basicallysocial, essentially denial.No, this is not going to work.No, I'm not going to join your lab.No, I'm not going to come\nwork for your company.No, I'm not going to\nbuy your product, right?No, I'm not going to meet with you.And so they get just like\ntremendous social resistance.They're not getting positive feedback\nfrom their social network the way thatmore agreeable people need to have, right?And this is why agreeableness\nis a problem for innovation.If you're agreeable, you're going\nto listen to the people around you.They're going to tell you that new\nideas are stupid, end of story.You're not going to proceed.And so I would put it more on like,\nthey need to be able to deal with, theyneed to be able to deal with social\ndiscomfort to the level of ostracism,or at some point they're going to get\nshaken out and they're just going to quit.Andrew Huberman: Do you think that\npeople that meet these criteriado best by banding with others\nthat meet these criteria early?Or is it important that they form this\ndeep sense of self, like the abilityto cry oneself to sleep at night or\nlie in the fetal position, worryingthat things aren't going to work\nout and then still get up the nextmorning and get right back out there.Marc Andreessen: Right.So, Sean Parker has the best\nline, by the way, on this.He says being an entrepreneur or being\na creator is like getting punchedin the face over and over again.He said, eventually you start to\nlike the taste of your own blood.And I love that line because it makes\neverybody massively uncomfortable,but it gives you a sense of how\nbasically painful the process is.If you talk to any entrepreneur who's\nbeen through it about that, they're like,oh, yeah, that's exactly what it's like.So, there is a big\nindividual component to it.But look, it can be very lonely, and\nespecially very hard, I think, to dothis if nobody around you is trying\nto do anything even remotely similar.And if you're getting just\nuniversally negative responses,like very few people, I think very\nfew people have the ego strength tobe able to survive that for years.So I do think there's a huge advantage,\nand this is why you do see clusters.There's a huge advantage to clustering.Throughout history, you've\nhad this clustering effect.You had clustering of the great\nartists and sculptors in, you had theclustering of the philosophers of Greece.You had the clustering of\ntech people in Silicon Valley.You have the clustering of\nknow, arts, movie, TV peoplein Los Angeles, and so forth.And so, know, there's\nalways a scene, right?There's always, like a nexus\nand a place where people cometogether for these kinds of things.So, generally speaking, if somebody\nwants to work in tech, innovate in tech,they're going to be much better off being\naround a lot of people who are trying todo that kind of thing than they are in\na place where nobody else is doing it.Having said that, the clustering can\nhave downsides, it can have side effects.And you put any group of people\ntogether, and you do start to getgroupthink, even among people who\nare individually very disagreeable.And so these same clusters where\nyou get these very idiosyncraticpeople, they do have fads and\ntrends just like every place else.And so they get wrapped up\nin their own social dynamics.The good news is the social dynamic in\nthose places is usually very forwardlooking, and so it's usually like, I don't\nknow, it's like a herd of iconoclastslooking for the next big thing.So iconoclasts, looking\nfor the next big thing.That's good.The herd part.That's what you've got to be careful of.So even when you're in one of\nthese environments, you have tobe careful that you're not getting\nsucked into the groupthink too much.Andrew Huberman: When you say groupthink,\ndo you mean excessive friction?Do you do pressure testing each\nother's ideas to the point wherethings just don't move forward?Or are you talking about groupthink,\nwhere people start to form a consensus?Or the self belief that, gosh, we are\nso strong because we are so different?Can we better define groupthink?Marc Andreessen: It's actually less\neither one of those things both happen.Those are good.Those are good.The part of groupthink I'm talking about\nis just like, we all basically zero in, wejust end up zeroing in on the same ideas.Right.In Hollywood, there's this classic thing.There are years where all of a sudden\nthere's, like, a lot of volcano movies.It's like, why are there\nall these volcano movies?And it's just like, there was just\nsomething in the gestalt, right?There was just something in the air.Look, Silicon Valley has this.There are moments in time\nwhere you'll have these.It's like the old thing.What's the difference\nbetween a fad and a trend?Fad is the trend that doesn't last.Right.And so Silicon Valley is subject to both\nfads and trends, just like any place.In other words, you take smart,\ndisagreeable people, you cluster themtogether, they will act like a herd.They will end up thinking the same\nthings unless they try very hard not to.Andrew Huberman: You've talked about these\npersonality traits of great innovators"

            "text": "before, and we're talking about them now.You invest in innovators, you try\nand identify them, and you are one.So you can recognize these traits here.I'm making the presumption\nthat you have these traits.Indeed you do.We'll just get that out of the way.Have you observed people trying to\nfeign these traits, and are there anyspecific questions or behaviors that are\na giveaway that they're pretending tobe the young Steve Jobs or that they're\npretending to be the young Henry Ford?Pick your list of other names that qualify\nas authentic, legitimate innovators.We won't name names of people\nwho have tried to disguisethemselves as true innovators.But what are some of the litmus tests?And I realize here that we don't\nwant you to give these away to thepoint where they lose their potency.But if you could share a few of those.Marc Andreessen: Good, we're\nactually a pretty open book on this.First of all, yes, so there are people who\ndefinitely try to come in and basicallypresent as being something that they're\nnot, and they've read all the books.They will have listened to this interview.They study everything and they\nconstruct a facade, and they come inand present as something they're not.I would say the amount of that varies\nexactly, correlated to the NASDAQ.And so when stock prices are super\nlow, you actually get the opposite.When stock prices are super\nlow, people get too demoralized.And people who should be doing\nit basically give up because theyjust think that the industry is\nover, the trend is over, whatever.It's all hopeless.And so you get this flushing thing.So nobody ever shows up at a stock\nmarket low and says, like, I'm thenew next big thing and doesn't really\nwant to do it because there are higherstatus, the kinds of people who do the\nthing that you're talking about, they'refundamentally oriented for social status.They're trying to get the social\nstatus without actually the substance.And there are always other places\nto go to get social status.So after 2000, the joke was,\nwhen I got to Silicon Valley in'93, '94, the Valley was dead.We can talk about that.By '98, it was roaring, and you had\na lot of these people showing up, whowere, you basically had a lot of people\nshowing up with these kind of stories.2000, the market crashed.By 2001, the joke was that there\nwere these terms, B to C and B to B.And in 1998, they meant B to C meant\nbusiness to consumer and B to Bmeant business to business, which\nis two different kinds of businessmodels for Internet companies.By 2001, B to B meant back to banking\nand B to C meant back to consulting,which is the high status people who, the\npeople oriented to status, who showed upto be in tech were like, yeah, screw it.This is over.Stick a fork in it.I'm going to go back to Goldman\nSachs or go back to McKinsey,where I can be high status.And so you get this flushing kind of\neffect that happens in a downturn.That said, in a big upswing, yeah, you\nget a lot of people showing up with alot of kind of, let's say, public persona\nwithout the substance to back it up.So the way we stress that you can actually\nsay exactly how we test for this, becausethe test exactly addresses the issue\nin a way that is impossible to fake.And it's actually the same way homicide\ndetectives try to find out if you'veactually, like, if you're innocent\nor whether you've killed somebody.It's the same tactic, which is, you ask\nincreasingly detailed questions, right?And so the way the homicide cop does\nthis is, what were you doing last night?Oh, I was at a movie.Which movie?Which theater?Okay, which seat did you sit in?Okay, what was the end of the movie?And you ask increasingly detailed\nquestions and people have trouble.At some point, people have trouble\nmaking up and things just fuzzinto just kind of obvious bullshit.And basically fake founders\nbasically have the same problem.They're able to relay a conceptual\ntheory of what they're doing that they'vekind of engineered, but as they get\ninto the details, it just fuzzes out.Whereas the true people that you want\nto back that can do it, basically whatyou find is they've spent five or ten\nor 20 years obsessing on the detailsof whatever it is they're about to do.And they're so deep in the\ndetails that they know so muchmore about it than you ever will.And in fact, the best possible\nreaction is when they get mad, whichis also what the homicide cops say.What you actually want is you want the\nemotional response of like, I can'tbelieve that you're asking me questions\nthis detailed and specific and pickyand they kind of figure out what\nyou're doing and then they get upset.That's good, that's perfect, right?But then they have to have proven\nthemselves in the sense of,they have to be able to answer\nthe questions in great detail.Andrew Huberman: Do you think that people\nthat are able to answer those questions"

vision in mind of how\nthings need to turn out or will turn out?Or do you think that they have\na vision and it's a no matterwhat, it will work out because the\nworld will sort of bend around it?I mean, in other words, do you think\nthat they place their vision incontext or they simply have a vision\nand they have that tunnel vision ofthat thing and that's going to be it?Let's use you for an\nexample with Netscape.That's how I first came to know your name.When you were conceiving Netscape,\ndid you think, okay, there's thissearch engine and this browser and\nit's going to be this thing thatlooks this way and works this way and\nfeels this way, did you think that?And also think about that there was\ngoing to be a gallery of other searchengines and it would fit into that\nlandscape of other search engines?Or were you just projecting your\nvision of this thing as thisunique and special brainchild?Marc Andreessen: Let me give the\ngeneral answer, and then we cantalk about the specific example.So the general answer is what?Entrepreneurship, creativity,\ninnovation is what economists calldecision making under uncertainty.In both parts, those are\nimportant decision making.Like, you're going to make a ton\nof decisions because you have todecide what to do, what not to do.And then uncertainty, which is like,\nthe world's a complicated place.And in mathematical terms, the\nworld is a complex adaptivesystem with feedback loops.And Isaac Asimov wrote in his\nnovels, he wrote about this fieldcalled psychohistory, which is\nthe idea that there's like asupercomputer that can predict the\nfuture of human affairs, right?And it's like, we don't have that.[LAUGHS] Not yet.Andrew Huberman: [LAUGHS] Not yet.We'll get to that later.Marc Andreessen: We certainly\ndon't have that yet.And so you're just dealing, you\nknow, military commanders callthis the fog of war, right?You're just dealing with a\nsituation where the number ofvariables are just off the charts.It's all these other people who are\ninherently unpredictable, making allthese decisions in different directions.And then the whole system is\ncombinatorial, which is thesepeople are colliding with each\nother, influencing their decisions.And so, I mean, look, the most\nstraightforward kind of way tothink about this is, it's amazing.Like, anybody who believes in\neconomic central planning, it alwaysblows my mind because it's just\nlike, try opening a restaurant.Try just opening a restaurant\non the corner down here.And like 50/50 odds, the\nrestaurant is going to work.And all you have to do to run a\nrestaurant is have a thing and serve food.And it's like most\nrestaurants fail, right?People who run restaurants\nare pretty smart.They usually think about these things\nvery hard, and they all want tosucceed, and it's hard to do that.And so to start a tech company or to\nstart an artistic movement or to fighta war, you're just going into this,\nbasically conceptual battleground orin military terms, real battleground,\nwhere there's just like incredible levelsof complexity, branching future paths,\nand so there's nothing predictable.And so what we look for is basically\nthe really good innovators.They've got a drive to basically be able\nto cope with that and deal with that.And they basically do that in two steps.So one is they try to pre-plan as\nmuch as they possibly can and wecall that the process of navigating\nthe, what we call the idea maze.And so the idea maze basically is, I've\ngot this general idea, and it might bethe Internet is going to work or search\nor whatever, and then it's like, okay, intheir head, they have thought through of\nlike, okay, if I do it this way, that way,this third way, here's what will happen.Then I have to do that, then I\nhave to do this, then I have tobring in somebody to do that.Here's the technical\nchallenge I'm going to hit.And they got in their heads as\nbest anybody could, they've got ascomplete a sort of a map of possible\nfutures as they could possibly have.And this is where I say, when you ask them\nincreasingly detailed questions, that'swhat you're trying to kind of get them to\nkind of chart out, is, okay, how far aheadhave you thought, and how much are you\nanticipating all of the different twistsand turns that this is going to take?Okay, so then they start on day\none, and then, of course, whathappens is now they're in it, now\nthey're in the fog of war, right?They're in future uncertainty.And now that idea maze is maybe not\nhelpful practically, but now they'regoing to be basically constructing\nit on the fly, day by day, as theylearn and discover new things and\nas the world changes around them.And of course, it's a feedback loop,\nbecause if their thing starts towork, it's going to change the world.And then the fact the world\nis changing is going to causetheir plan to change as well.And so, yeah, the great ones,\nbasically, the great onescourse correct every single day.They take stock of what they've learned.They modify the plan.The great ones tend to think\nin terms of hypotheses, right?Like a scientific sort of mentality,\nwhich is they tend to think,okay, I'm going to try this.I'm going to go into the world, I'm going\nto announce that I'm doing this for sure.I'm going to say, this is my plan.I'm going to tell all my employees\nthat, and I'm going to tell all myinvestors that, and I'm going to put\na stake in there, and it's my plan,and then I'm going to try it, and even\nthough I sound like I have completecertainty, I know that I need to test\nto find out whether it's going to work.And if it's not, then I have to go\nback to all those same people andhave to say, well, actually, we're\nnot going left, we're going right.And they have to run that loop thousands\nof times to get through the other side.And this led to the creation of this great\nterm pivot, which has been very helpfulin our industry because the word, when\nI was young, the word we used was fuckup, and pivot sounds like so much better,\nsounds like so much more professional.But, yeah, you make mistakes.It's just too complicated to understand.You course correct,\nyou adjust, you evolve.Often these things, at least in business,\nthe businesses that end up workingreally well tend to be different than\nthe original plan, but that's part ofthe process of a really smart founder\nbasically working their way throughreality as they're executing their plan.Andrew Huberman: The way you're\ndescribing this has parallels toa lot of models in biology and the\npractice of science, random walks,but that aren't truly random,\npseudo-random walks in biology, etc.But one thing that is becoming\nclear from the way you're describingthis is that I could imagine\na great risk to early success."

            "text": "So, for instance, somebody develops\na product, people are excited by it,they start to implement that product,\nbut then the landscape changes, andthey don't learn how to pivot to\nuse the less profane version of it.They don't learn how to do that.In other words, and I think of everything\nthese days, or most everything, interms of reward schedules and dopamine\nreward schedules, because that isthe universal currency of reward.And so when you talk about the Sean\nParker quote of learning to enjoythe taste of one's own blood, that\nis very different than learning toenjoy the taste of success, right?It's about internalizing success\nas a process of being selfdetermined and less agreeable, etc.In other words, building up of those five\ntraits becomes the source of dopamine,perhaps in a way that's highly adaptive.So on the outside, we just see the\nproduct, the end product, the iPhone,the MacBook, the Netscape, etc.But I have to presume, and I'm not\na psychologist, but I have doneneurophysiology and I've studied the\ndopamine system enough to know thatwhat's being rewarded in the context\nof what you're describing soundsto be a reinforcement of those five\ntraits, rather than, oh, it's goingto be this particular product, or the\ncompany is going to look this way, orthe logo is going to be this or that.That all seems like the peripheral\nto what's really going on, that greatinnovators are really in the process\nof establishing neural circuitrythat is all about reinforcing\nthe me and the process of being.Marc Andreessen: So this is like\nextrinsic versus intrinsic motivation.So, the Steve Jobs kind of\nZen version of this, right?Or the sort of hippie version of\nthis was the journey is the reward.He always told his employees that.It's like, look, everybody thinks in\nterms of these big public markers,like the stock price or the IPO\nor the product launch or whatever.He's like, no, it's actually\nthe process itself is the point.Right to your point, if you have that\nmentality, then that's an intrinsicmotivation, not an extrinsic motivation.And so that's the kind of\nintrinsic motivation that cankeep you going for a long time.Another way to think about it is\ncompeting against yourself, right?It's like, can I get better at doing this?And can I prove to myself\nthat I can get better?There's also a big social component\nto this, and this is one of thereasons why Silicon Valley punches\nso far above its weight as a place.There's a psychological component\nwhich also goes to the comparison set.So a phenomenon that we've observed\nover time is the leading tech companyin any city will aspire to be as large\nas the previous leading tech company inthat city, but often not larger, right?Because they have a model of success.And as long as they beat that level\nof success, they've kind of checkedthe box like they've made it.But then, in contrast, you're in\nSilicon Valley, and you look aroundand it's just like Facebook and Cisco\nand Oracle and Hewlett Packard and--Andrew Huberman: --Gladiators--Marc Andreessen: --Yeah.And you're just, like,\nlooking at these giants.Many of them are still, Mark Zuckerberg,\nstill going to work every day.And so these people are, like,\nthe role models are, like, alive.They're, like, right there, and it's so\nclear how much better they are and howmuch bigger their accomplishments are.And so what we find is young\nfounders in that environmenthave much greater aspirations.Because, again, at that point, maybe\nit's the social status, maybe there'san extrinsic component to that, or\nmaybe it helps calibrate that internalsystem to basically say, actually, no,\nthe opportunity here is not to buildwhat you may call a local maximum\nform of success, but let's build to aglobal maximum form of success, which\nis something as big as we possibly can.Ultimately, the great ones are\nprobably driven more internally thanexternally when it comes down to it.And that is where you get this phenomenon\nwhere you get people who are extremelysuccessful and extremely wealthy\nwho very easily could punch out andmove to Fiji and just call it, and\nthey're still working 16 hour days.Obviously something explains that that\nhas nothing to do with external rewards,and I think it's an internal thing.Andrew Huberman: As many of you\nknow, I've been taking AG1 daily"

            "text": "of these folks, and I appreciate that.We're going even deeper into that today.And we will talk about the landscape\naround whether or not Silicon Valleyor New York, whether or not there\nare specific cities that are idealfor certain types of pursuits.I think there was an article written by\nPaul Graham some years ago, about theconversations that you overhear in a city\nwill tell you everything you need to knowabout whether or not you belong there\nin terms of your professional pursuits.Some of that's changed over time, and\nnow we should probably add Austin to themix because it was written some time ago.In any event, I want to return to\nthat, but I want to focus on an aspectof this intrinsic versus extrinsic\nmotivators in terms of somethingthat's a bit more cryptic, which\nis one's personal relationships.If I think about the catalog of innovators\nin Silicon Valley, some of them, likeSteve Jobs, had complicated personal\nlives, romantic personal lives earlyon, and it sounds like he worked it out.I don't know.I wasn't their couple's therapist.But when he died, he was in a\nmarriage that for all the worldseemed like a happy marriage.You also have examples of innovators\nwho have had many partners, manychildren with other partners.Elon comes to mind.I don't think I'm disclosing\nanything that isn't already obvious.Those could have been happy\nrelationships and just had many of them.But the reason I'm asking this is you\ncan imagine that for the innovator,the person with these traits, who's\ntrying to build up this thing, whateverit is, that having someone, or several\npeople in some cases, who just trulybelieve in you when the rest of the\nworld may not believe in you yet orat all, could be immensely powerful.And we have examples from\ncults that embody this.We have examples from politics.We have examples from tech\ninnovation and science.And I've always been fascinated by\nthis because I feel like it's the morecryptic and yet very potent form of\nallowing someone to build themselves up.It's a combination of inner\npsychology and extrinsic motivation.Because obviously, if that person\nwere to die or leave them or cheaton them or pair up with some other\ninnovator, which we've seen severaltimes recently and in the past, it\ncan be devastating to that person.But what are your thoughts on the\nrole of personal, and in particular,romantic relationship as it relates\nto people having an idea and theirfeeling that they can really bring\nthat idea to fruition in the world?Marc Andreessen: So it's a real mixed bag.You have lots of examples\nin all directions, and Ithink it's something like.Something like the following.So first, we talked about the\npersonality traits of these people.They tend to be highly disagreeable.Andrew Huberman: Doesn't foster\na good romantic relationship.Marc Andreessen: Highly\ndisagreeable people can bedifficult to be in a relationship.[LAUGHS]Andrew Huberman: [LAUGHS] I may have\nheard of that once or twice before.A friend may have given me that example.Marc Andreessen: Yeah.Right.And maybe you just need to find the\nright person who compliments thatand is willing to, there's a lot of\nrelationships where it's always thisquestion about relationships, right?Which is, do you want to have the\nsame personality growth profile, thesame behavioral traits, basically,\nas your partner, or do you actuallywant to have, is it an opposite thing?I'm sure you've seen this.There are relationships where you'll\nhave somebody who's highly disagreeable,who's paired with somebody who's highly\nagreeable, and it actually works out greatbecause one person just gets to be on\ntheir soapbox all the time, and the otherperson is just like, okay, it's fine.Right?\nIt's fine.It's good.You put two disagreeable people\ntogether, maybe sparks fly and theyhave great conversations all the time,\nand maybe they come to hate each other.Anyway, so these people, if you're\ngoing to be with one of thesepeople, you're fishing out of\nthe disagreeable end of the pond.And again, when I say disagreeable, I\ndon't mean these are normal distributions.I don't mean, like 60%\ndisagreeable or 80% disagreeable.The people we're talking\nabout are 99.99% disagreeable.So these are ordinary people.So part of it's that.And then, of course, they have\nthe other personality traits.They're super conscientious.They're super driven.As a consequence, they\ntend to work really hard.They tend to not have a lot of time\nfor family vacations or other things.Then they don't enjoy them if\nthey're forced to go on them.And so, again, that kind of\nthing can fray at a relationship.So there's a fair amount\nin there that's loaded.Like, somebody who's going to\npartner with one of these peopleneeds to be signed up for the ride.And that's a hard thing.That's a hard thing to do.Or you need a true partnership of two\nof these, which is also hard to do.So I think that's part of it.And then, look, I think a big part of\nit is people achieve a certain level ofsuccess, and either in their own minds\nor publicly, and then they start to beable to get away with things, right?And they start to be able to.It's like, well, okay, now we're rich\nand successful and famous, and now Ideserve, and this is where you get into...I view this now in the\nrealm of personal choice.You get into this thing where people\nstart to think that they deserve things,and so they start to behave in very\nbad ways, and then they blow up theirpersonal worlds as a consequence.And maybe they regret it\nlater, and maybe they don't.Right?It's always a question.I think there's that.And then, I don't know, maybe the other\npart of it is that some people justneed more emotional support than others.And I don't know that that's a big, I\ndon't know that that tilts either way.I know some of these people who have\ngreat, loving relationships and seemto draw very much on having this\nkind of firm foundation to rely upon.And then I know other people who\nare just like, their personal livesare just a continuous train wreck.And it doesn't seem to matter,\nlike, professionally, they justkeep doing what they're doing.And maybe we could talk here\nabout whatever is the personalitytrait for risk taking.Some people are so incredibly risk\nprone that they need to take risk inall aspects of their lives at all times.And if part of their life gets\nstable, they find a way to blow it up.And that's some of these people you\ncould describe in those terms also.Andrew Huberman: Yeah,\nlet's talk about that."

            "text": "Because I think risk taking and\nsensation seeking is something thatfascinates me for my own reasons\nand in my observations of others.Does it dovetail with these five traits\nin a way that can really serve innovation,in ways that can benefit everybody?The reason I say to benefit everybody\nis because there is a view of howwe're painting this picture of the\ninnovator as this really cruel person.But oftentimes, what we're talking\nabout are innovations that make theworld far better for billions of people.Marc Andreessen: Yeah, that's right.And by the way, everything we're\ntalking about also is not just intech or science or in business.Everything we're also talking\nabout is true for the arts.The history of artistic expression.You have people with all\nthese same kinds of traits.Andrew Huberman: Well, I was thinking\nabout Picasso and his regular turnoverof lovers and partners, and he was very\nopen about the fact that it was one of thesources of his productivity, creativity.He wasn't shy about that.I suppose if he were alive today,\nit might be a little bit different.He might be judged a little differently.Marc Andreessen: Or that was his\nstory for behaving in a patternthat was very awful for the people\naround him, and he didn't care.Andrew Huberman: Right,\nmaybe they left him?Marc Andreessen: Yeah.\nWho knows?Right?Puts and takes to all this, but no.Okay, so I have a theory.So here's a theory.This is one of these, I keep a\nlist of things that will get mekicked out of a dinner party and\ntopics at any given point in time.Andrew Huberman: Do you\nread it before you go in?Marc Andreessen: Yeah.On auto recall, so that I\ncan get out of these things.Here's the thing that can\nget me kicked out of a dinnerparty, especially these days.So think of the kind of person where it's\nvery clear that they're super high, toyour point, this is somebody who's super\nhigh output in whatever domain they're in.They've done things that have\nfundamentally changed the world.They've brought new, whether it's\nbusinesses or technologies or worksof art, entire schools of creative\nexpression, in some cases to the world.And then at a certain point, they\nblow themselves to smithereens, right?And they do that either through\na massive financial scandal.They do that through a\nmassive personal breakdown.They do that through some sort\nof public expression that causesthem a huge amount of problems.They say the wrong thing, maybe not\nonce, but several hundred times,and blow themselves to smithereens.There's this moral arc that people\nkind of want to apply, which it'slike the Icarus flying too close to\nthe sun and he had it coming and heneeded to keep his ego under control.And you get kind of this\njudgment that applies.So I have a different theory on this.So the term I use to describe these\npeople, and by the way, a lot of otherpeople who don't actually blow themselves\nup but get close to it, which is awhole 'nother set of people, I call\nthem martyrs to civilizational progress.We're backwards, civilizational progress.So look, the only way civilization\ngets moved forward is when peoplelike this do something new.Because civilization as a\nwhole does not do new things.Groups of people do not do new things.These things don't happen automatically.By default nothing changes.The only way civilizational change on any\nof these axes ever happens is because oneof these people stands up and says, no,\nI'm going to do something different thanwhat everybody else has ever done before.So, this is progress, like,\nthis is actually how it happens.Sometimes they get lionized or awarded.Sometimes they get crucified.Sometimes the crucifixion is literal.Sometimes it's just symbolic.But they are those kinds of people,\nand then martyrs when they go down inflames and again, this is where it really\nscrews the people's moral judgmentsbecause everybody wants to have the sort\nof super clear story of like, okay, hedid a bad thing and he was punished.And I'm like, no, he was the kind of\nperson who was going to do great thingsand also was going to take on a level\nof risk and take on a level of sort ofextreme behavior such that he was going\nto expose himself to flying too close tothe sun, wings melt and crash to ground.But it's a package deal.The reason you have the Picasso's\nand the Beethovens and all thesepeople is because they're willing to\ntake these extreme level of risks.They are that creative and original,\nnot just in their art or their business,but in everything else that they\ndo that they will set themselves upto be able to fail psychologically.A psychologist would probably, or\npsychiatrist would probably say maybe.To what extent do they actually\nhave a death wish at some point.Do they want to punish themselves?Do they want to fail?That I don't know.But you see this.They deliberately move themselves too\nclose to the sun, and you can see itwhen it's happening, because if they\nget too far away from the sun, theydeliberately move back towards it.Right.They come right back, and\nthey want the risk anyway.So martyrs to civilizational progress.This is how progress happens.When these people crash and\nburn, the natural inclinationis to judge them morally.I tend to think we should basically\nsay, look, and I don't even know if thismeans, like, giving them a moral pass\nor whatever, but it's like, look, thisis how civilization progresses, and we\nneed to at least understand that there'sa self sacrificial aspect to this that\nmay be tragic and often is tragic, butit is quite literally self sacrificial.Andrew Huberman: Are there any examples\nof great innovators who were able tocompartmentalize their risk taking to\nsuch a degree that they had what seemedto be a morally impeccable life in every\ndomain except in their business pursuits?Marc Andreessen: Yeah, that's right.So some people are very\nhighly controlled like that.Some people are able to very narrowly,\nand I don't really want to set myselfan example on a lot of this, but I\nwill tell you as an example, I willnever use debt in business, number one.Number two, I have the most placid\npersonal life you can imagine.Number three, I'm the last\nperson in the world who is evergoing to do an extreme sport.I mean, I'm not even going to\ngo in the sauna on the ice bath.I'm not doing any of this.I'm not tele skiing.Andrew Huberman: No obligation.Marc Andreessen: I'm not on the Titan.I'm not going down to see the Titanic.Goodness, you weren't doing any of this.I'm not doing any of this stuff.I have no interest.I don't play golf.I don't ski.I have no interest in\nany of this stuff, right?And I know people like this,\nright, who are very high achievers.It's just like, yeah,\nthey're completely segmented.They're extreme risk takers.In business, they're completely buttoned\ndown on the personal side, they'recompletely buttoned down financially.They're scrupulous with following every\nrule and law you can possibly imagine,but they're still fantastic innovators.And then I know many others who are\njust like their life is on fire allthe time, in every possible way.And whenever it looks like the fire is\nturning into embers, they figure outa way to relight the fire, and they\njust really want to live on the edge.And so I think that's\nan independent variable.And again, I would apply the same thing.I think the same thing\napplies to the arts.Classical music as an example.I think Bach was, as an example,\none of the best musicians of alltime, had just a completely sedate\npersonal life, never had any aberrantbehavior at all in his personal life.Family man, tons of kids,\napparently pillar of the community.Right.And so if Bach could be Bach and yet\nnot burn his way through 300 mistressesor whatever, maybe you can, too.Andrew Huberman: So in thinking about\nthese two different categories ofinnovators, those that take on tremendous\nrisk in all domains of their life and"

            "text": "those that take on tremendous risk in\na very compartmentalized way, I don'tknow what the percentages are, but I\nhave to wonder if in this modern age ofthe public being far less forgivable,\nwhat I'm referring to is cancel culture.Do you think that we are limiting\nthe number of innovations in totalby just simply frightening or\neliminating an enormous category ofinnovators because they don't have\nthe confidence or the means or thestrategies in place to regulate?So they're just either bowing out\nor they're getting crossed off,they're getting canceled one by one.Marc Andreessen: So do you think\nthe public is less tolerant thanthey used to be or more tolerant?Andrew Huberman: Well, the systems\nthat, I'm not going to be careful here.I think the large institution systems\nare not tolerant of what the publictells them they shouldn't be tolerant of.And so if there's enough noise,\nthere's enough noise in the mob.I think institutions bow out.And here I'm referring not just\nto, they essentially say, okay,let the cancellation proceed.Maybe they're the gavel that\ncomes down, but they're not thelever that got the thing going.And so I'm not just\nthinking about universities.I'm also thinking about advertisers.I'm thinking about the big movie\nhouses that cancel a film that agiven actor might be in because they\nhad something in their personal lifethat's still getting worked out.I'm thinking about people who\nare in a legal process that's notyet resolved, but the public has\ndecided they're a bad person, etc.Marc Andreessen: My question is, are\nwe really talking about the public?I agree with your question, and I'm\ngoing to come back to it, but I'mgoing to examine one part of your\nquestion, which is, is this reallythe public we're talking about.And I would just say Exhibit A is\nwho is the current frontrunner forthe Republican nomination today?The public, at least on one side of the\npolitical aisle, seems very on board.Number two, like, look, there's a\ncertain musician who flew too close tothe sun, blew himself to smithereens.He's still hitting all time highs\non music streams every month.The public seems fine.I would argue the public is actually\nmore open to these things thanit actually maybe ever has been.And we could talk about\nwhy that's the case.I think it's a differentiation,\nand this is what your question wasaiming at, but it's a differentiation\nbetween the public and the elites.My view is everything that you just\ndescribed is an elite phenomenon.And actually, the public is\nvery much not on board with it.So what's actually happening is\nwhat's happened is the publicand the elites have gapped out.The public is more forgiving of what\npreviously might have been considered kindof aberant and extreme behavior, right?F.Scott Fitzgerald, \"there are no\nsecond acts in American lives\"turns out was completely wrong.Turns out there are second\nacts, third acts, fourth acts.Apparently you can have an\nunlimited number of acts.The public is actually up for it.Yeah.Andrew Huberman: I mean, I think\nof somebody like Mike Tyson, right?I feel like his life\nexemplifies everything.That's amazing and great and\nalso terrible about America.Marc Andreessen: If we took Mike Tyson to\ndinner tonight at any restaurant anywherein the United States, what would happen?Andrew Huberman: He would be loved.Marc Andreessen: Oh, he would be\nlike, the outpouring of enthusiasm andpassion and love would be incredible.It would be unbelievable.This is a great example.And again, I'm not even\ngoing to draw more.I'm not even going to say I agree\nwith that or disagree with that.I think we all intuitively know that the\npublic is just like, 100%, absolutely.He's a legend.\nHe's a living legend.He's like a cultural touchstone.Absolutely.And you see it when he\nshows up in movies, right?I don't remember the, I mean, the big\nbreakthrough where I figured this outwith respect to him because I don't really\nfollow sports, but when he showed up inthat, it was that first Hangover movie,\nand he shows up and I was in a theaterand the audience just goes, bananas crazy.They're so excited to see him.Andrew Huberman: He evokes delight.I always say that Mike Tyson is the\nonly person I'm aware of that canwear a shirt with his own name on it,\nand it somehow doesn't seem wrong.In fact, it just kind of\nmakes you like him more.His ego feels very contoured in a way that\nhe knows who he is and who he was, and yetthere's a humbleness woven in, maybe as a\nconsequence of all that he's been through.I don't know.But, yeah, people love Mike.Marc Andreessen: Public loves him now.Exactly.Now, if he shows up to lecture at\nHarvard, right, I think you're probablygoing to get a different reaction?[LAUGHS]\nAndrew Huberman: I don't know.I don't know!You know, the guy who wrote The Wire\ngave a talk at Harvard, and it soundedto me, based on his report of that,\nwhich is very interesting, in fact,that people adore people who are\nconnected to everybody in that way.I feel like everybody loves Mike.From above his status, the sides\nbelow his status, he occupiesthis halo of love and adoration.Marc Andreessen: Okay.Andrew Huberman: All right.Marc Andreessen: Yeah.Look, the other side of this is\nthe elites, and you kind of alludedto this, of the institution.So basically, it's like the people who\nare at least nominally in charge orfeel like that they should be in charge.Andrew Huberman: I want to\nmake sure we define elite.So you're not necessarily talking\nabout people who are wealthy.You're talking about people who\nhave authority within institutions.Marc Andreessen: So the ultimate\ndefinition of an elite iswho can get who fired, right.That's the ultimate test.Who can get who fired, boycotted,\nblacklisted, ostracized.Like when push, prosecuted, jailed,\nlike when push comes to shove.I think that's always the question,\nwho can destroy whose career?And of course, you'll notice\nthat that is heavily asymmetricwhen these fights play out.Like, it's very clear which side can get\nthe other side fired and which side can't.And so, yeah, so, look, I think\nwe live in a period of time wherethe elites have gotten to be\nextreme in a number of dimensions.I think it's characterized by, for\nsure, extreme groupthink, extremesanctimony, extreme moral, I would\nsay dudgeon, this weird sort of modernpuritanism, and then an extreme sort\nof morality of punishment and terroragainst their perceived enemies.But I want to go through that\nbecause I actually think that'sa very different phenomenon.I think what's happening at the\nelites is very different than what'shappening in the population at large.And then, of course, I think there's\na feedback loop in there, whichis, I think the population at large\nis not on board with that program.Right.I think the elites are aware\nthat the population is noton board WIth that program.I think they judge the population\nnegatively as a consequence, that causesthe elites to harden their own positions.That causes them to be even more\nalienating to the population.And so they're in sort of an\noppositional negative feedback loop.But again, it's a sort of question,\nokay, who can get who fired?And so elites are really good\nat getting normal people fired.Ostracized, banned, hit pieces\nin the press, like, whatever.For normal people to get elites fired,\nthey have to really band together, right.And really mount a serious challenge,\nwhich mostly doesn't happen, but mightbe starting to happen in some cases.Andrew Huberman: Do you think this\npower of the elites over, stemmed"

their own voice.And yet we've seen a dramatic uptick\nin the number of cancellations andfirings related to immoral behavior\nbased on things that were eitherdone or amplified on social media.It's almost as if the public is\nholding the wrong end of the knife.Marc Andreessen: Yeah, so the way I\ndescribe it, I use these two terms,and they're somewhat interchangeable,\nbut elites and institutions.And then they're somewhat interchangeable\nbecause who runs the institutions?The elites, right?And so it's sort of a\nself reinforcing thing.And institutions of all kinds.Institutions, everything from the\ngovernment, bureaucracies, companies,nonprofits, foundations, NGOs,\ntech companies, on and on and on.Like people who are in charge of big\ncomplexes and that carry a lot of,basically, power and influence and\ncapability and money as a consequenceof their positional authority.So the head of a giant foundation\nmay never have done anything in theirlife that would cause somebody to have\na high opinion of them as a person.But they're in charge of this\ngigantic multi billion dollarcomplex and have all this power.And so that's just defined\nterms, at least in institutions.So, it's actually interesting.Gallup has been doing polls on the\nfollowing on the question of trustin institutions, which is sort of\ntherefore a proxy for trust in elites,basically since the early 1970s.And they do this across all the categories\nof big institutions, basically everyone.I just talked about a bunch of others.Big business, small business,\nbanks, newspapers, broadcasttelevision, the military, police.So they've got like 30\ncategories or something.And basically what you see is almost\nall the categories basically started inthe early 70s at like 60 or 70% trust.And now almost across the board,\nthey've just had a complete,basically linear slide down for\n50 years, basically my whole life.And they're now bottoming out.Congress and journalists\nbottom out at like 10%.The two groups everybody hates\nare Congress and journalists.And then it's like a lot of\nother big institutions arelike, in their 20s, 30s, 40s.Actually, big business\nactually scores fairly high.Tech actually scores quite high.The military scores quite high.But basically everything\nelse has really caved in.This is sort of my fundamental challenge\nto everybody who basically says, andyou didn't do this, but you'll hear the\nsimple form of this, which is socialmedia caused the current trouble.And let's call this an example, collapse\nin faith in institutions and elites.Let's call that part\nof the current trouble.Everybody's like, well,\nsocial media caused that.I was like, well, no, social\nmedia, social media is new, right?In the last...social media is effectively new,\npractically speaking, since 2010,2012 is when it really took off.And so, if the trend started in the\nearly 1970s and has been continuous, thenwe're dealing with something broader.Martin Gurri wrote, I think, the best book\non this called the Revolt of the Public, where he goes through this in detail.He does say that social media\nhad a lot to do with what'shappened in the last decade.But he says, yeah, if you go\nback, you look further, it wasbasically two things coinciding.One was just a general change\nin the media environment.And in particular, the 1970s is when you\nstarted to, and especially in the 1980s,is when you started to get specifically\ntalk radio, which was a new outlet.And then you also got cable television.And then you also, by the way, it's\nactually interesting in that you hadpaperback books, which was another\none of these, which was an outlet.So you had like a fracturing in the\nmedia landscape that started in the50s through the, then, of course,\nthe Internet blew it wide open.Having said that, if the elites and\nthe institutions were fantastic,you would know it more than ever.Information is more accessible.And so the other thing that he says,\nand I agree with, is the public isnot being tricked into thinking the\nelites and institutions are bad.They're learning that they're bad, and\ntherefore, the mystery of the Galluppoll is why those numbers aren't all\njust zero, which is arguably, in alot of cases, where they should be.Andrew Huberman: I think one reason that--Marc Andreessen: --By the\nway, he thinks this is bad.So he and I have a different view.So here's where he and I disagree.He thinks this is bad.So he basically says, you can't\nreplace elites with nothing.You can't replace institutions with\nnothing, because what you're just leftwith is just going to be wreckage.You're going to be left with a completely,\nbasically atomized, out of controlsociety that has no ability to marshal\nany sort of activity in any direction.It's just going to be a\ndog eat dog awful world.I have a very different view on\nthat which we can talk about.Andrew Huberman: Yeah, I'd love\nto hear your views on that.I'd like to take a quick break and\nacknowledge our sponsor, InsideTracker."

            "text": "one reason that I and many other people\nsort of reflexively assume that socialmedia caused the demise of our faith and\ninstitutions is, well, first of all, Iwasn't aware of this lack of correlation\nbetween the decline in faith ininstitutions and the rise of social media.But secondarily that we've seen\nsome movements that have essentiallyrooted themselves in tweets, in\ncomments, in posts that get amplified,and those tweets and comments and\nposts come from everyday people.In fact, I can't name one person who\ninitiated a given cancellation ormovement because it was the sort of\ndogpiling or mob adding-on to someperson that was essentially anonymous.So I think that for many of us, we\nhave the, to use neuroscience language,as sort of a bottom up perspective,\noh, someone sees something in theirdaily life or experiences something in\ntheir daily life, and they tweet aboutit or they comment about it or they\npost about it, and then enough peopledogpile on the accused that it picks\nup force, and then the elites feelcompelled, obligated to cancel somebody.That tends to be the narrative.And so I think the logical\nconclusion is, oh, social mediaallows for this to happen.Whereas normally someone would just\nbe standing on the corner shoutingor calling lawyers that don't have\nfaith in them, and you've got the ErinBrockovich model that turns into a movie.But that's a rare case of this lone woman\nwho's got this idea in mind about how abig institution is doing wrong or somebody\nis doing wrong in the world and then canleverage the big institution, excuse me.But the way that you describe it is\nthat the elites are leading this shift.So what is the role of the public in it?Just to give it a concrete example,\nif, for instance, no one tweeted orcommented on me, too, or no one tweeted\nor commented about some ill behaviorof some, I don't know, university\nfaculty member or business person,would the elite have come down on them?Marc Andreessen: Anyway, what's happening?Based on what I've seen over the years,\nthere is so much astroturfing right now.There are entire categories of\npeople who are paid to do this.Some of them we call journalists,\nsome of them we call activists,some of them we call NGO nonprofit.Some of them we call university\nprofessors, some of them wecall grad students, whatever,\nthey're paid to do this.I don't know if you've ever looked into\nthe misinformation industrial complex?There's this whole universe of\nbasically these funded groupsthat basically do misinformation.And they're constantly mounting\nthese kinds of attacks.They're constantly trying to gin\nup this kind of basically panicto cause somebody to get fired.Andrew Huberman: So\nit's not a grassroots--Marc Andreessen: --No.\nIt's the opposite of grassroots.No.Almost always going to\ntrace these things back.It was a journalist, it was an activist,\nit was a public figure of some kind.These are entrepreneurs\nin a sort of a weird way.Basically their job, mission\ncalling, is all wrapped up togetherlike they're true believers, but\nthey're also getting paid to do it.And there's a giant funding, I\nmean, there's a very large fundingcomplex for this coming from\ncertain high profile people who puthuge amounts of money into this.Andrew Huberman: Is this well known?Marc Andreessen: Yes.Well, it is in my world.So this is what the social media\ncompanies have been on the receivingend of for the last decade.It's basically a political media activism\ncomplex with very deep pockets behind it.And you've got people who basically,\nliterally have people who sit all dayand watch the TV network on the other\nside or watch the Twitter feeds on theother side, and they basically wait.It's like every politician, this has\nbeen the case for a long time now.Every politician who goes out and gives\nstump speeches, you'll see there's alwayssomebody in the crowd with a camcorder\nor now with a phone recording them.And that's somebody from the other\ncampaign who's paid somebody tojust be there and record every\nsingle thing the politician says.So that when a Mitt Romney says,\nwhatever, the 47% thing, they'vegot it on tape, and then they clip\nit, and they try to make it viral.And again, look, these people\nbelieve what they're doing.I'm not saying it's even dishonest.Like, these people believe\nwhat they're doing.They think they're fighting a holy war.They think they're protecting democracy.They think they're\nprotecting civilization.They think they're protecting\nwhatever it is they're protecting.And then they know how to use\nthe tools, and so they know howto try to gin up the outrage.And then, by the way, sometimes\nit works in social cascades.Sometimes it works, sometimes it doesn't.Sometimes they cascade,\nsometimes they don't.But if you follow these people on\nTwitter, this is what they do every day.They're constantly trying\nto, like, light this fire.Andrew Huberman: I assume that it was\nreally bottom up, but it sounds likeit's sort of middle level, and that\nit captures the elites, and then thething takes on a life of its own.Marc Andreessen: By the way, it also\nintersects with the trust and safetygroups at the social media firms who are\nresponsible for figuring out who getspromoted and who gets banned across this.And you'll notice one large social\nmedia company has recently changedhands and has implemented a different\nkind of set of trust and safety.And all of a sudden, a different\nkind of boycott movement hasall of a sudden started to work\nthat wasn't working before that.And another kind of boycott movement\nis not working as well anymore.And so, for sure, there's\nan intermediation happening.Look, the stuff that's happening in\nthe world today is being intermediatedthrough social media, because social\nmedia is the defining media of our time.But there are people who know how\nto do this and do this for a living.No, I view very much the cancellation\nwave, like, this whole thing, it's anelite phenomenon, and when it appears\nto be a grassroots thing, it's eithergrassroots among the elites, which\nis possible because there's a fairlylarge number of people who are signed\nup for that particular crusade, butthere's also a lot of astroturfing\nthat's taking place inside that.The question is, okay, at what\npoint does the population atlarge get pulled into this?And maybe there are movements,\ncertain points in time where theydo get pulled in, and then maybe\nlater they get disillusioned.And so then there's some question there.And then there's another question\nof like, well, if the population atlarge is going to decide what these\nmovements are, are they going to be thesame movements that the elites want?And how are the elites going\nto react when the populationactually fully expresses itself?Like I said, there's a feedback loop\nbetween these where the more extremethe elites get, they tend to push\nthe population to more extreme viewson the other side and vice versa.So it ping pongs back and forth.And so, yeah, this is our world.Andrew Huberman: Yeah,\nthis explains a lot.Marc Andreessen: I want to make sure\nthat Schellenberger, Matt Taibbi, a bunchof these guys have done a lot of work.If you just look into what's called\nthe misinformation industrial complex,you'll find a network of money and\npower that is really quite amazing.Andrew Huberman: I've seen more\nand more Schellenberger showing up.Marc Andreessen: Right.And he's just, look,\nhe's just on this stuff.He, and just, they're literally\njust like tracking money.It's very clear how the money flows,\nincluding a remarkable amount of moneyout of the government, which is, of\ncourse, in theory, very concerning.Andrew Huberman: Very interesting.Marc Andreessen: The government should\nnot be funding programs that takeaway people's constitutional rights.And yet somehow that is\nwhat's been happening.Andrew Huberman: Very interesting.I want to make sure that I hear\nyour ideas about why the decline"

            "text": "in confidence in institutions\nis not necessarily problematic.Is this going to be a total\ndestruction, burning down of theforest that will lead to new life?Is that your view?Marc Andreessen: Well,\nso this is the thing.And look, there's a question if you're,\nthere's a couple of questions in here,which is like, how bad is it really?How bad are they?Right.\nAnd I think they're pretty bad.A lot of them are actually pretty bad.So that's one big question.And then, yeah, look, the other question\nis like, okay, if the institution has gonebad or a group of elites have gone bad,\nit's this wonderful word, reform, right?Can they be reformed?And everybody always wants to reform\neverything, and yet somehow nothingever quite ever gets reformed.And so people are trying to reform\nhousing policy in the Bay Area fordecades, and we're not building.We're building fewer\nhouses than ever before.So somehow reform movements seem\nto lead to just more bad stuff.But anyway, yeah.So if you have an existing\ninstitution, can it be reformed?Can it be fixed from the inside?What's happened in universities?There are professors at Stanford\nas an example, who very muchthink that they can fix Stanford.Like, I don't know what you think.It doesn't seem like it's going in\nproductive directions right now.Andrew Huberman: Well, I mean,\nthere are many things about Stanfordthat function extremely well.It's a big institution.It's certainly got its\nissues like any other place.They're also my employer, Marc's\ngiving me some interesting looks.He wants me to get a little more vocal.Marc Andreessen: I didn't\nmean to put you on the spot.Yeah.Andrew Huberman: I mean, one of\nthe things about being a researcherat a big institution like Stanford\nis, well, first of all, it meetsthe criteria that you described.Know, you look to the left, you look\nto the right or anywhere above orbelow you, and you have excellence.Right?I mean, I've got a Nobel Prize\nwinner below me whose daddy also wona Nobel Prize, and his scientific\noffspring is likely to win.I mean, it inspires you to\ndo bigger things than oneordinarily would, no matter what.So there's that, and that's great.And that persists.There's all the bureaucratic red tape\nabout trying to get things done and howto implement decisions is very hard,\nand there are a lot of reasons for that.And then, of course, there are the\nthings that many people are aware of.There are public accusations about\npeople in positions of great leadership,and that's getting played out.And the whole thing becomes kind\nof overwhelming and a little bitopaque when you're just trying to\nrun your lab or live your life.And so I think one of the reasons\nfor this lack of reform that you'rereferring to is because there's\nno position of reformer, right?So deans are dealing with a lot of issues.Provosts are dealing with a lot of issues.Presidents are dealing with a lot of\nissues, and then some in some cases.And so we don't have a dedicated role\nof reformer, someone to go in andsay, listen, there's just a lot of\nfat on this and we need to trim itor we need to create this or do that.There just isn't a system to do that.And that's, I think in part, because\nuniversities are built on old systems,and it's like the New York subway.It's amazing i t still works as\nwell as it does, and yet it'sgot a ton of problems also.Marc Andreessen: So the point, we could\ndebate the university specifically,but the point is like, look, if you do\nthink institutions are going bad, andthen you have to make it number one.You have to figure out if you\nthink institutions are going bad.The population largely does think\nthat at the very least, the peoplewho run institutions ought to really\nthink hard about what that means.Andrew Huberman: But people still\nstrive to go to these places.And I still hear from people\nwho, for instance, did not go tocollege, are talking about how\na university degree is useless.They'll tell you how proud they are\nthat their son or daughter is goingto Stanford or is going to UCLA\nor is going to Urbana Champaign.I mean, it's almost like, to me, that's\nalways the most shocking contradiction,is like, these institutions don't matter.But then when people want to hold\nup a card that says why theirkid is great, it's not about how\nmany pushups they can do or thatthey started their own business.Most of the time it's they're\ngoing to this university.And I think, well, what's going on here?Marc Andreessen: So do you think the\nmedian voter in the United Statescan have their kid go to Stanford?Andrew Huberman: No.Marc Andreessen: Do you think the\nmedian voter in the United Statescould have their kid admitted to\nStanford, even with a perfect SAT?Andrew Huberman: No, no.In this day and age, the competition\nis so fierce that it requires more.Marc Andreessen: Yeah.So first of all, again,\nwe're dealing here.Yes.We're dealing with a small number\nof very elite institutions.People may admire them or not.Most people have no\nconnectivity to them whatsoever.In the statistics, in the polling,\nuniversities are not doing well.The population at large, yeah,\nthey may have fantasies about theirkid going to Stanford, but the\nreality of it is they have a verycollapsing view of these institutions.So anyway, this actually goes straight to\nthe question of alternatives then, right?Which is like, okay, if you believe\nthat there's collapsing faith in theinstitutions, if you believe that it\nis merited, at least in some ways, ifyou believe that reform is effectively\nimpossible, then you are faced...We could debate each of those,\nbut the population at largeseems to believe a lot of that.Then there's a question of\nlike, okay, can it be replaced?And if so, are you better off\nreplacing these things basically,while the old things still exist?Or do you actually need to\nbasically clear the field to beable to have the new thing exist?The universities are a great\ncase study of this because ofhow student loans work, right?And the way student loans work is to\nbe an actual competitive universityand compete, you need to have\naccess to federal student lending.Because if you don't, everybody\nhas to pay out of pocket.And it's completely out of reach for\nanybody other than a certain class ofeither extremely rich or foreign students.So you need access to a\nfederal student loan facility.To get access to a federal\nstudent loan facility, you needto be an accredited university.Guess who runs the accreditation council?Andrew Huberman: I don't know.Marc Andreessen: The\nexisting universities, right?So it's a self laundering machine.Like they decide who the\nnew universities are.Guess how many new universities get\naccredited, each year to be able...Andrew Huberman: Zero.Marc Andreessen: Zero, right?And so as long as that system is in place,\nand as long as they have the governmentwired the way that they do, and as\nlong as they control who gets access tofederal student loan funding, of course\nthere's not going to be any competition.Of course there can't be a new institution\nthat's going to be able to get to scale.It's not, not possible.And so if you actually wanted to\ncreate a new system that was betterin, you know, I would argue dozens or\nhundreds of ways, it could obviously bebetter if you were starting it today.It probably can't be done as long as the\nexisting institutions are actually intact.And this is my counter to Martin, which\nis like, yeah, look, if we're goingto tear down the old, there may be a\nperiod of disruption before we get tothe new, but we're never going to get to\nthe new if we don't tear down the old.Andrew Huberman: When you say counter\nto Martin, you're talking aboutthe author of Revolt of the Public?\n Marc Andreessen: Yeah, Martin Gurri.What Martin Gurri says is like, look,\nhe said basically as follows, the elitesdeserve contempt, but the only thing\nworse than these elites that deservecontempt would be no elites at all.And he basically says on the other\nside of the destruction of the elitesand the institutions is nihilism.You're basically left with nothing.And by the way, there\nis a nihilistic streak.I mean, there's a nihilistic streak\nin the culture and the politics today.There are people who basically\nwould just say, yeah, just tearthe whole system down without any\nparticular plan for what follows.And so I think he makes a good point\nand that you want to be careful that youactually have a plan on the other side\nthat you think is actually achievable.But again, the counterargument\nto that is if you're not willingto actually tear down the old,\nyou're not going to get to the new.Now, what's interesting, of\ncourse, is this is what happensevery day in business, right?So the entire way, how do you know\nthat the capitalist system works?The way that you know is that the old\ncompanies, when they're no longer likethe best at what they do, they get torn\ndown and then they ultimately die andthey get replaced by better companies.Andrew Huberman: Yeah, I\nhaven't seen a Sears in a while.Marc Andreessen: Exactly.And we know what's so interesting\nis we know in capitalism, in amarket economy, we know that's the\nsign of health, that's the sign ofhow the system is working properly.And in fact, we get actually\njudged by antitrust authoritiesin the government on that basis.It's like the best defense against\nantitrust charges is no, peopleare coming to kill us and they're\ndoing a really good job of it.That's how we know we're doing our job.And in fact, in business we are\nspecifically, it is specificallyillegal for companies in the same\nindustry to get together and plotand conspire and plan and have things\nlike these accreditation bureaus.If I created the equivalent in my\ncompanies of the kind of accreditationbureau that the universities have, I'd\nget sent straight to federal prisonand a trust violation Sherman Act.Straight to prison.People have been sent to prison for that.So in the business world, we\nknow that you want everythingsubject to market competition.We know that you want\ncreative destruction.We know that you want replacement\nof the old with superior new.It's just once we get outside of business,\nwe're like, oh, we don't want any of that.We want basically stagnation and log\nrolling and basically institutionalincestuous, like entanglements\nand conflicts of interest asfar as the eye can see, and then\nwe're surprised by the results.Andrew Huberman: So let's play it\nout as a bit of a thought experiment.So let's say that one small banding\ntogether of people who want to start a newuniversity where there is free exchange\nof open ideas, where unless somebody hasegregious behavior, violent behavior,\ntruly sexually inappropriate behavioragainst somebody that is committing\na crime, they're allowed to be there.They're allowed to be a student or\na faculty member or administrator.And let's just say this accreditation\nbureau allowed student loans forthis one particular university.Or let's say that there was an independent\nsource of funding for that universitysuch that students could just apply there.They didn't need to be part of this\nelite, accredited group, which soundsvery mafia-like, frankly, not necessarily\nviolent, but certainly coercive inthe way that it walls people out.Let's say that then there were\n20 or 30 of those or 40 of those.Do you think that over time, that model\nwould overtake the existing model?Marc Andreessen: Isn't it\ninteresting that those don't exist?Remember Sherlock Holmes,\nThe Dog that Didn't Bark?\n Andrew Huberman: It is\ninteresting that they don't exist.Marc Andreessen: Right.\nSo there's two possibilities.One is like, nobody wants\nthat, which I don't believe.And then the other is like, the\nsystem is wired in a way thatwill just simply not allow it.And you did a hypothetical in\nwhich the system would allow it.And my response to that is, no, of\ncourse the system won't allow that.Andrew Huberman: Or the people that band\ntogether have enough money or get enoughresources to say, look, we can afford to\ngive loans to 10,000 students per year.10,000 isn't a trivial number when\nthinking about the size of a university.And most of them hopefully will graduate\nin four years and there'll be a turnover.Do you think that the great future\ninnovators would tend to orient towardthat model more than they currently\ndo toward the traditional model?What I'm trying to get back to here is\nhow do you think that the current modelthwarts innovation, as well as maybe some\nways that it still supports innovation?Certainly cancellation and the risk of\ncancellation from the way that we framedit earlier, is going to discourage risk\ntakers of the category of risk takersthat take risk in every domain that\nreally like to fly close to the sunand sometimes into the sun or are--Marc Andreessen: --Doing research that\nis just not politically palatable.Andrew Huberman: Right, that we can't\neven talk about on this podcast, probablywithout causing a distraction of what\nwe're actually trying to talk about.Marc Andreessen: That gives\nup the whole game right there.Exactly.Andrew Huberman: I keep a file, and\nit's a written file because I'm afraidto put it into electronic form of all\nthe things that I'm afraid to talkabout publicly because I come from a\nlineage of advisors where all three diedyoung, and I figure, if nothing else,\nI'll die, and then I'll make it intothe world and let's say 510 years, 20\nyears, and if not, I know a certaintyI'm going to die at some point, and then\nwe'll see where all those issues stand.In any event--Marc Andreessen: --is that list\ngetting l onger over time or shorter?Andrew Huberman: Oh, it's\ndefinitely getting longer.Marc Andreessen: Isn't that interesting?Andrew Huberman: Yeah,\nit's getting much longer.I mean, there are just so many issues\nthat I would love to explore on thispodcast with experts and that I can't\nexplore, just even if I had a panelof them, because of the way that\nthings get soundbited and segmentedout and taken out of context, it's\nlike the whole conversation is lost.And so, unfortunately, there are an\nimmense number of equally interestingconversations that I'm excited to\nhave, but it is a little disturbing.Marc Andreessen: Do you\nremember Lysenkoism?Andrew Huberman: No.Marc Andreessen: Famous in the\nhistory of the Soviet Union.This is the famous thing.So there was a geneticist named Lysenko.Andrew Huberman: That's why it sounds\nfamiliar, but I'm not calling to--Marc Andreessen: --Well, he was the guy\nwho did communist genetics, the fieldof genetics, the Soviets did not approve\nof the field of genetics because, ofcourse, they believed in the creation\nof the new man and total equality,and genetics did not support that.And so if you were doing traditional\ngenetics, you were going to know, atthe very least be fired, if not killed.And so this guy Lysenko stood up and said,\noh, I've got Marxist genetics, right?I've got, like a whole new\nfield of genetics that basicallyis politically compliant.And then they actually implemented\nthat in the agriculturesystem of the Soviet Union.And it's the origin of one of the\nbig reasons that the Soviet Unionactually fell, which was they\nultimately couldn't feed themselves.Andrew Huberman: So create a new notion\nof biology as it relates to genetics.Marc Andreessen: Politically\ncorrect biology, right?They not only created it, they taught it,\nthey mandated it, they required it, andthen they implemented it in agriculture.Andrew Huberman: Interesting.Marc Andreessen: I never understood.There was a bunch of things in\nhistory I never understood until thelast decade, and that's one of them.Andrew Huberman: Well, I censor myself\nat the level of deleting certain things,but I don't contort what I do talk about.So I tend to like to play\non lush, open fields.Just makes my life a lot easier.Marc Andreessen: But this goes to the rot.This goes to the rot, and I'll come\nback to your question, but this goesto the rot in the existing system,\nwhich is, by the way, I'm no different.I'm just like you.Like, I'm trying not to\nlight myself on fire either.But the rot in the existing system,\nand by system, I mean the institutionsand the elites, the rot is that the set\nof things that are no longer allowed.I mean, that list is obviously expanding\nover time, and that's real, historicallyspeaking, that doesn't end in good places.Andrew Huberman: Is this group\nof a particular generation thatwe can look forward to the time\nwhen they eventually die off.Marc Andreessen: It's a third of\nthe Boomers plus the Millennials.Andrew Huberman: So, got a while.Marc Andreessen: Good news, bad news.Gen X is weird, right?I'm Gen X.Gen X is weird because we\nkind of slipped in the middle.We were kind of the, I don't\nknow how to describe it.We were the kind of non-political\ngeneration kind of sandwiched betweenthe Boomers and the Millennials.Gen Z is a very, I think, open\nquestion right now which way they go.I could imagine them being\nactually much more intense than theMillennials on all these issues.I could also imagine them\nreacting to the Millennialsand being far more open minded.Andrew Huberman: We don't know\nwhich way it's going to go.Marc Andreessen: Yeah, it's going to go.It might be different groups of them.Andrew Huberman: I'm Gen\nX also, I'm 47, you're...?Marc Andreessen: 52.Andrew Huberman: So I grew up with\nsome John Hughes films and so where thejocks and the hippies and the punks,\nand were all divided and they wereall segmented, but then it all sort of\nmishmashed together a few years later.And I think that had a lot to do\nwith, like you said, the sort ofapolitical aspect of our generation.Marc Andreessen: The Gen X just\nknew the Boomers were nuts, right?Like, one of the great sitcoms of\nthe era was Family Ties , right?With the character Michael P.Keaton.And he was just like, this guy\nis just like, yeah, my Boomerhippie parents are crazy.I'm just going to go into business\nand actually do something productive.There was something iconic about\nthat character in our culture.And people like me were like, yeah,\nobviously you go into business, youdon't go into political activism.And then it's just like, man,\nthat came whipping back aroundwith the next generation.So just to touch real quick\non the university thing."

to do new universities.Like, I would say it's certainly possible.I hope they succeed.I'm pulling for them.I think it'd be great.I think it'd be great if there\nw ere a lot more of them.Andrew Huberman: Who\nfounded this university?Marc Andreessen: This is\na whole group of people.I don't want to freelance on that because\nI don't know originally who the idea was--Andrew Huberman: --University\nof Austin, not UT Austin.Marc Andreessen: Yeah.\nSo this is not UT Austin.It's called the University of Austin.Or they call it.I think it's UATX?And it's a lot of very sharp\npeople associated with it.They're going to try, very much\nexactly like what you described.They're going to try to do a new one.I would just tell you the wall\nof opposition that they'reup against is profound.And part of it is economic,\nwhich is can they ever get accessto federal student lending?And I hope that they can, but it\nseems nearly inconceivable theway the system is rigged today.And then the other is just like they\nalready have come under, I mean,anybody who publicly associates with\nthem who is in traditional academiaimmediately gets lit on fire, and\nthere's, you know, cancellation campaigns.So they're up against a\nwall of social ostracism.Andrew Huberman: Wow.Marc Andreessen: They're up\nagainst a wall of press attacks.They're up against a wall of people\njust like doing the thing, pouncing on,anytime anybody says anything, they're\ngoing to try to burn the place down.Andrew Huberman: This reminds me of\nJerry Springer episodes and GeraldoRivera episodes where it's like if\na teen listened to Danzig or MarilynManson type music or Metallica, that\nthey were considered a devil worshiper.Now we just laugh, right?We're like, that's crazy, right?People listen to music with all\nsorts of lyrics and ideas and looks.That's crazy.But there were people\nlegitimately sent to prison.I think it was a West\nMemphis three, right?These kids out in West Memphis that\nlooked different, acted different,were accused of murders that eventually\nwas made clear they clearly didn'tcommit, but they were in prison\nbecause of the music they listened to.I mean, this sounds very similar to that.And I remember seeing bumpersickers,\nFree the West Memphis Three!And I thought this was some crazy thing.And you look into it and this\nisn't, it's a little bit niche,but these are real lives.And there was an active witch\nhunt for people that lookeddifferent and acted different.And yet now we're sort of in this inverted\nworld where on the one hand we're alltold that we can express ourselves\nhowever we want, but on the otherhand, you can't get a bunch of people\ntogether to take classes where they learnbiology and sociology and econ in Texas.Wild.Marc Andreessen: Yes.Well, so the simple explanation\nis this is Puritanism, right?So this is the original American\nPuritanism that just worksitself out through the system in\ndifferent ways at different times.There's a religious phenomenon in\nAmerica called the Great Awakenings.There will be these periods in\nAmerican history where there'sbasically religiosity fades and\nthen there will be this snapbackeffect where you'll have basically\nthis frenzy basically, of religion.In the old days, it would have been\ntent revivals and people speakingin tongues and all this stuff.And then in the modern world, it's of the\nform that we're living through right now.And so, yeah, it's just basically these\nwaves of sort of American religious, andremember, religion in our time, religious\nimpulses in our time don't get expressedbecause we live in more advanced times.We live in scientifically informed times.And so religious impulses in our time\ndon't show up as overtly religious.They show up in a secularized form,\nwhich, of course, conveniently, istherefore not subject to the First\nAmendment separation of church and state.As long as the church is\nsecular, there's no problem.But we're acting out these kind\nof religious scripts over and overagain, and we're in the middle\nof another religious frenzy.Andrew Huberman: There's a phrase\nthat I hear a lot, and I don'tnecessarily believe it, but I want\nyour thoughts on it, which is,\"the pendulum always swings back.\"Marc Andreessen: Yeah, not quite.[LAUGHS]Andrew Huberman: So that's\nhow I feel, too, because--Marc Andreessen: --Boy,\nthat would be great.Andrew Huberman: Take any number of\nthings that we've talked about, and,gosh, it's so crazy the way things\nhave gone with institutions, or it'sso crazy the way things have gone with\nsocial media, or it's so crazy, fillin the blank and people will say, well,\nthe pendulum always swings back likeit's the stock market or something.After every crash, there'll be\nan eventual boom and vice versa.Marc Andreessen: By the\nway, that's not true either.Most stock markets we have\nare, of course, survivorship.It's all survivorship.Everything is survivor.Everything you just said is\nobviously survivorship bias.Right.So if you look globally, most\nstock markets, over time crashand burn and never recover.The American stock market\nhasn't always recovered.Andrew Huberman: I was referring\nto the American stock market.Marc Andreessen: Globally, b ut\nthe reason everybody refers to theAmerican stock market is because\nit's the one that doesn't dothat, the other 200 or whatever,\ncrash and burn and never recover.Let's go check in on the\nArgentina stock market right now.I don't think it's\ncoming back anytime soon.Andrew Huberman: My father is Argentine\nand immigrated to the US in the 1960s,so he would definitely agree with you.Marc Andreessen: Yeah.When their stocks crash,\nthey don't come back.And then Lysenkoism, like, the\nSoviet Union never recovered fromLysenkoism, it never came back.It led to the end of the\ncountry, you know, literally.The things that took down the\nSoviet Union were oil and wheat.And the wheat thing, you can trace\nthe crisis back to Lysenkoism.No, look, pendulum swings back is\ntrue only in the cases where thependulum swings back, everybody just\nconveniently forgets all the othercircumstances where that doesn't happen.One of the things people, you see this\nin business also, people have a reallyhard time confronting really bad news.I don't know if you've noticed that.I think every doctor who's listening\nright now is like, yeah, no shit.But have you seen in business,\nthere are situations, that StarTrek , remember Star Trek ? The\nKobayashi Maru simulator, right?So the big lesson to become a Star Trek\ncaptain is you had to go through thesimulation called the Kobayashi Maru,\nand the point was, there's no way to win.It's a no win scenario.And then it turned out like,\nCaptain Kirk was the onlyperson to ever win the scenario.And the way that he did it was he went in\nahead of time and hacked the simulator.It was the only way to\nactually get through.And then there was a debate whether\nto fire him or make him a captain.So they made him a captain.You know, the problem is,\nin real life, you do get theKobayashi Maru on a regular basis.Like, there are actual no win situations\nthat you can't work your way out of.And as a leader, you can't\never cop to that, right?Because you have to carry things\nforward, and you have to look forevery possible choice you can.But every once in a while, you\ndo run into a situation whereit's really not recoverable.And at least I've found people\njust cannot cope with that.What happens is they basically, then\nthey basically just exclude it fromtheir memory that it ever happened.Andrew Huberman: I'm glad you brought up\nsimulators, because I want to make sure"

            "text": "that we talk about the new and emerging\nlandscape of AI artificial intelligence.And I could try and smooth our\nconversation of a moment ago with thisone by creating some clever segue, but I'm\nnot going to, except I'm going to ask, isthere a possibility that AI is going to\nremedy some of what we're talking about?Let's make sure that we earmark that\nfor discussion a little bit later.But first off, because some of\nthe listeners of this podcastmight not be as familiar with\nAI as perhaps they should be.We've all heard about\nartificial intelligence.People hear about machine learning, etc.But it'd be great if you could\ndefine for us what AI is.People almost immediately hear AI\nand think, okay, robots taking over.I'm going to wake up, and I'm going to\nbe strapped to the bed and my organsare going to be pulled out of me.The robots are going to\nbe in my bank account.They're going to kill all my\nchildren and dystopia for most.Clearly, that's not the way it's going\nto go if you believe that machinescan augment human intelligence, and\nhuman intelligence is a good thing.So tell us what AI is and where you\nthink it can take us, both good and bad.Marc Andreessen: So, there was a big\ndebate when the computer was firstinvented, which is in the 1930s,\n1940s, people like Alan Turing andJohn von Neumann and these people.And the big debate at the time was because\nthey knew they wanted to build computers.They had the basic idea, and there had\nbeen, like, calculating machines beforethat, and there had been these looms that\nyou basically programmed to punch cards.And so there was a prehistory to computers\nthat had to do with building sort ofincreasingly complex calculating machines.So they were kind of on a track,\nbut they knew they were going tobe able to build, they called it a\ngeneral purpose computer that couldbasically, you could program, in the\nway that you program computers today.But they had a big debate early on,\nwhich is, should the fundamentalarchitecture of the computer be based\non either A, like calculating machines,like cache registers and looms and\nother things like that, or should itbe based on a model of the human brain?And they actually had this idea\nof computers modeled on the humanbrain back then, and this is this\nconcept of so called neural networks.And it's actually fairly astonishing\nfrom a research standpoint.The original paper on neural networks\nactually was published in 1943.So they didn't have our level of\nneuroscience, but they actually knewabout the neuron, and they actually\nhad a theory of neurons interconnectingand synapses and information\nprocessing in the brain even back then.And a lot of people at the time\nbasically said, you know what?We should basically have the computer\nfrom the start be modeled after thehuman brain, because if the computer\ncould do everything that the humanbrain can do, that would be the best\npossible general purpose computer.And then you could have it do\njobs, and you could have it createart, and you could have it do all\nkinds of things like humans can do.It turns out that didn't happen.In our world, what happened instead was\nthe industry went in the other direction.It went basically in the model of the\ncalculating machine or the cash register.And I think, practically speaking, that\nkind of had to be the case, becausethat was actually the technology\nthat was practical at the time.But that's the path and so what we all\nhave experiences with, up to and includingthe iPhone in our pocket, is computers\nbuilt on that basically calculatingmachine model, not the human brain model.And so what that means is computers,\nas we have come to understandthem, they're basically like\nmathematical savants at best.So they're really good at doing\nlots of mathematical calculations.They're really good at executing these\nextremely detailed computer programs.They're hyper literal.One of the things you learn early\nwhen you're a programmer is, as thehuman programmer, you have to get\nevery single instruction you givethe computer correct because it will\ndo exactly what you tell it to do.And bugs in computer programs are always\na mistake on the part of the programmer.Interesting.You never blame the computer.You always blame the programmer\nbecause that's the nature of thething that you're dealing with.Andrew Huberman: One downscore\noff and the whole thing--Marc Andreessen: --Yeah, and\nit's the programmer's fault.And if you talk to any programmer,\nthey'll agree with this.They'll be like, yeah, if\nthere's a problem, it's my fault.I did it.I can't blame the computer.The computer has no judgment.It has no ability to interpret,\nsynthesize, develop an independentunderstanding of anything.It's literally just doing what\nI tell it to do step by step.So for 80 years we've had this,\njust this very kind of hyperliteral kind of model computers.Technically, these are what are called\nvon Neumann machines, based afterthe mathematician John von Neumann.They run in that way, and they've been\nvery successful and very important,and our world has been shaped by them.But there was always this other idea\nout there, which is, okay, how abouta completely different approach,\nwhich is based much more on how thehuman brain operates, or at least\nour kind of best understanding ofhow the human brain operates, right?Because those aren't the same thing.It basically says, okay, what\nif you could have a computerinstead of being hyper literal?What if you could have it actually\nbe conceptual and creative andable to synthesize information and\nable to draw judgments and ableto behave in ways that are not\ndeterministic but are rather creative?And the applications for\nthis, of course, are endless.And so, for example, the self-driving\ncar, the only way that you cannotprogram a computer with rules to\nmake it a self-driving car, youhave to do what Tesla and Waymo and\nthese other companies have done.Now you have to use, right, you\nhave to use this other architecture,and you have to basically teach\nthem how to recognize objects inimages at high speeds, basically\nthe same way the human brain does.And so those are so called\nneural networks running inside.Andrew Huberman: So, essentially, let\nthe machine operate based on priors.We almost clipped a boulder going up\nthis particular drive, and so therefore,this shape that previously the machine\ndidn't recognize as a boulder, it nowintroduces to its catalog of boulders.Is that a good example?Marc Andreessen: Let's even make it\neven starker for a self-driving car.There's something in the road.Is it a small child or a plastic\nshopping bag being blown by the wind?Very important difference.If it's a shopping bag, you definitely\nwant to go straight through it, becauseif you deviate off course, you're\ngoing to make a fast, it's the samechallenge we have when we're driving.You don't want to swerve to avoid a\nshopping bag because you might hitsomething that you didn't see on the side.But if it's a small child for\nsure you want to swerve, right?But in that moment, small children come\nin different shapes and descriptions andare wearing different kinds of clothes.Andrew Huberman: They might tumble onto\nthe road the same way a bag would tumble.Marc Andreessen: Yeah, they\nmight look like they're tumbling.And by the way, they might\nbe wearing a Halloween mask.Right.They might not have a\nrecognizable human face.It might be a kid with one leg.You definitely want to not hit those.This is what basically we figured out\nis you can't apply the rules basedapproach of a Von Neumann machine to\nbasically real life and expect thecomputer to be in any way understanding\nor resilient, to change to basicallythings happening in real life.And this is why there's always been\nsuch a stark divide between what themachine can do and what the human can do.And so, basically, what's happened is\nin the last decade, that second typeof computer, the neural network based\ncomputer, has started to actually work.It started to work, actually, first,\ninterestingly, in vision, recognizingobjects and images, which is why the\nself-driving car is starting to work.Andrew Huberman: Face recognition.Marc Andreessen: Face recognition.Andrew Huberman: I mean, when I\nstarted off in visual neuroscience,which is really my original home in\nneuroscience, the idea that a computeror a camera could do face recognition\nbetter than a human was like a verylow probability event based on the\ntechnology we had at the time, basedon the understanding of the face\nrecognition cells and the fusiform gyrus.Now, you would be smartest to put\nall your money on the machine.You want to find faces in airports,\neven with masks on and at profileversus straight on, machines can do\nit far better than almost all people.I mean, they're the super recognizers.But even they can't\nmatch the best machines.Now, ten years ago, what I just\nsaid was the exact reverse, right?Marc Andreessen: That's right, yeah.So faces, handwriting, and\nthen voice, being able tounderstand voice just as a user.If you use Google Docs, it has\na built-in voice transcription.They have sort of the best industry\nleading kind of voice transcription.If you use a voice transcription in\nGoogle Docs, it's breathtakingly good.You just speak into it and it\njust types what you're saying.Andrew Huberman: Well, that's good,\nbecause in my phone, every once ina while, I'll say I need to go pick\nup a f ew things and it'll say,I need to pick up a few thongs.And so Apple needs to get on board.Whatever the voice recognition\nis that Google's using--Marc Andreessen: --Maybe it\nknows you better than you think.Andrew Huberman: [LAUGHS] That was not\nthe topic I was avoiding discussing.Marc Andreessen: No.So that's on the list, right?That's on your...Actually, there's a reason, actually,\nwhy Google's so good and Apple is"

            "text": "not right now at that kind of thing.And it actually goes to actually an\nideological thing, of all things.Apple does not permit pooling of\ndata for any purpose, includingtraining AI, whereas Google does.And Apple's just like, stake\ntheir brand on privacy.And among that is sort of a pledge\nthat they don't pool your data.And so all of Apple's AI is like, AI\nthat has to happen locally on your phone.Whereas Google's AI can\nhappen in the cloud.Right?\nIt can happen across pool data.Now, by the way, some people\nthink that that's bad becausethey think pooling data is bad.But that's an example of the shift that's\nhappening in the industry right now,which is you have this separation between\nthe people who are embracing the newway of training AIs and the people who\nbasically, for whatever reason, are not.Andrew Huberman: Excuse me, you\nsay that some people think it'sbad because of privacy issues or\nthey think it's bad because of thereduced functionality of that AI.Marc Andreessen: Oh, no.\nSo you're definitely going to get...there's three reasons\nAIs have started to work.One of them is just simply larger\ndata sets, larger amounts of data.Specifically, the reason why objects\nand images are now, the reasonmachines are now better than humans\nat recognizing objects, images orrecognizing faces is because modern\nfacial recognition AIs are trained acrossall photos on the Internet of people.Billions and billions and\nbillions of photos, right?Unlimited number of photos\nof people on the Internet.Attempts to train facial\nrecognition systems.Ten or 20 years ago, they'd be trained on\nthousands or tens of thousands of photos.Andrew Huberman: So the input\ndata is simply much m ore vast.\n Marc Andreessen: Much larger.This is the reason to get\nto the conclusion on this.This is the reason why\nChatGPT works so well.One of the reasons ChatGPT\nworks so well is it's trainedon the entire Internet of text.And the entire Internet of text was\nnot something that was available foryou to train an AI on until it came\nto actually exist itself, which isnew in the last, basically decade.Andrew Huberman: So in the case of\nface recognition, I could see howhaving a much larger input data set\nwould be beneficial if the goal isto recognize Marc Andreessen's face,\nbecause you are looking for signal tonoise against everything else, right?But in the case of ChatGPT, when you're\npooling all text on the internet and youask ChatGPT to, say, construct a paragraph\nabout Marc Andreessen's prediction ofthe future of human beings over the\nnext ten years and the likely to be mostsuccessful industries, give ChatGPT that.If it's pooling across all\ntext, how does it know what isauthentically Marc Andreessen's text?Because in the case of face recognition,\nyou've got a standard to work from averified image versus everything else.In the case of text, you have to make\nsure that what you're starting with isverified text from your mouth, which\nmakes sense if it's coming from video.But then if that video is deep\nfaked, all of a sudden, what's true?Your valid Marc Andreessen is in question.And then everything ChatGPT is\nproducing, that is then of question.Marc Andreessen: So I would say\nthere's a before and after thing here.There's like a before ChatGPT and after\nGPT question, because the existenceof GPT itself changes the answer.So before ChatGPT.So the version you're using today is\ntrained on data up till September 2021.They're cut off with the training set.Up till September 2021, almost all text on\nthe Internet was written by a human being.And then most of that was written\nby people under their own names.Some of it wasn't, but a lot of it was.And why do you know it's for me is\nbecause it was published in a magazineunder my name, or it's a podcast\ntranscript and it's under my name.And generally speaking, if you just\ndid a search on what are things MarcAndreessen has written and said,\n90% plus of that would be correct,and somebody might have written a\nfake parody article or something.Like that.But not that many people were\nspending that much time writing fakearticles about things that I said.Andrew Huberman: Right now, so\nmany people can pretend to be you.Marc Andreessen: Exactly right.And so, generally speaking, you\ncan kind of get your arms aroundthe idea that there's a corpus\nof material associated with me.Or by the way, same thing with you.There's a corpus of YouTube transcripts\nand other, your academic papersand talks you've given, and you can\nkind of get your hands around that.And that's how these systems are trained.They take all that data\ncollectively, they put it in there.And that's why this\nworks as well as it does.And that's why if you ask ChatGPT to\nspeak or write like me or like you or likesomebody else, it will actually generally\ndo a really good job because it has allof our prior text in its training data.That said, from here on\nout, this gets harder.And of course, the reason this gets\nharder is because now we have AI thatcan create text and we have AI that\ncan create text at industrial scale.Andrew Huberman: Is it\nwatermarked as AI generated text?Marc Andreessen: No.Andrew Huberman: How hard\nwould it be to do that?Marc Andreessen: I think it's impossible.I think it's impossible.There are people who\nare trying to do that.This is a hot topic in the classroom.I was just talking to a friend who's got\nlike a 14 year old kid in a class, andthere's like these recurring scandals.Every kid in the class is using ChatGPT to\nwrite their essays or to help them writetheir essays, and then the teacher is\nusing one of, there's a tool that you canuse that purports to be able to tell you\nwhether something was written by ChatGPT.But it's like, only right\nlike 60% of the time.And so there was this case where the\nstudent wrote an essay where theirparent sat and watched them write the\nessay, and then they submitted it, andthis tool got the conclusion incorrect.And then the student feels outraged\nbecause he got unfairly cheated.But the teacher is like, well,\nyou're all using the tool.Then it turns out there's another\ntool that basically you feed intext, and they call it a summarizer.But what it really is is it's a\ncheating mechanism to basicallyjust shuffle the words around\nenough so that it sheds whatevercharacteristics were associated with AI.So, there's like an arms race going\non in educational settings rightnow around this exact question.I don't think it's possible to do.There are people working\non the watermarking.I don't think it's possible\nto do the watermarking.And I think it's just kind of obvious why\nit's not possible to do that, which isyou can just read the output for yourself.It's really good.How are you actually going to tell\nthe difference between that andsomething that a real person wrote?And then, by the way, you\ncan also ask ChatGPT to writein different styles, right?So you can tell it, like, write\nin the style of a 15 year old.You can tell it to write in the style\nof a non native English speaker.Or if you're a non native English\nspeaker, you can tell it towrite in the style of an English\nspeaker, native English speaker.And so the tool itself\nwill help you evade.I think there's a lot of\npeople who are going to want todistinguish, \"real\" versus fake.I think those days are over.Andrew Huberman: Genie's\nout of the bottle.Marc Andreessen: Genie is\ncompletely out of the bottle.And by the way, I actually\nthink this is good.This doesn't map to my worldview\nof how we use this technologyanyway, which we can come back to.So there's that, and then there's\nthe problem, therefore of theso-called deep fake problem."

about, butwhere it, for all the world looked like\na conversation that we were having andwe never had that specific conversation.Marc Andreessen: Yeah, that's right.So that's going to happen for sure.So what there's going to need to\nbe is there need to be basicallyregistries where basically in your\ncase, you will submit your legitimatecontent into a registry under your\nunique cryptographic key, right.And then basically there will be a\nway to check against that registry tosee whether that was the real thing.And I think this needs\nto be done for sure.For public figures, it needs\nto be

asked,is this your account about a direct\nmessage that somebody got on Instagram?And I always tell them, look,\nI only have the one account,this one verified account.Although now, with the advent of\npay to play, verification makes ita little less potent as a security\nblanket for knowing if it's notthis account, then it's not me.But in any case, these accounts pop\nup all the time pretending to be me.And I'm relatively low on the scale.Not low, but relatively low on\nthe scale to say, like a Beyonceor something like that, who has\nhundreds of millions of followers.So is there a system in mind\nwhere people could go in andverify text, click yes or no.This is me.This is not me.And even there, there's the opportunity\nfor people to fudge, to eliminate thingsabout themselves that they don't want\nout there, by saying, no, that's not me.I didn't actually say that.Or create that.Marc Andreessen: Yeah, no, that's right.Technologically, it's actually\npretty straightforward.So the way to implement this\ntechnologically is with a public key.It's called public key cryptography,\nwhich is the basis for how cryptographyinformation is secured in the world today.And so basically, the implementation form\nof this would be, you would pick whateveris your most trusted channel, and let's\nsay it's your YouTube channel as anexample, where just everybody just knows\nthat it's you on your YouTube channelbecause you've been doing it for ten\nyears or whatever, and it's just obvious.And you would just publish in\nthe about me page on YouTube, youwould just publish your public\ncryptographic key that's unique to you.Right.And then anytime anybody wants\nto check to see whether any pieceof content is actually you, they\ngo to a registry in the cloudsomewhere, and they basically submit.They basically say, okay, is this him?And then they can basically see\nwhether somebody with your publickey, you had actually certified that\nthis was something that you made.Now, who runs that registry\nis an interesting question.If that registry is run by the government,\nwe will call that the Ministry of Truth.I think that's probably a bad idea.If that registry is run by a company,\nwe would call that basically theequivalent of, like, a credit\nbureau or something like that.Maybe that's how it happens.The problem with that is that company\nnow becomes hacking target number one,right, of every bad person on Earth.Because if anybody breaks\ninto that company, they canfake all kinds of things.Andrew Huberman: They own the truth.Marc Andreessen: Right.\nThey own the truth.And by the way, insider threat, also,\ntheir employees can monkey with it.So you have to really trust that company.The third way to do it\nis with a blockchain.And so this, with the crypto\nblockchain technology, you could havea distributed system, basically, a\ndistributed database in the cloudthat is run through a blockchain.And then it implements this cryptography\nand this certification process.Andrew Huberman: What\nabout quantum Internet?Is that another way to\nencrypt these things?I know most of our listeners are\nprobably not familiar with quantumInternet, but put simply, it's a way to\nsecure communications on the Internet.Let's just leave it at that.It's sophisticated, and we'll probably do\na whole episode about this at some point.But maybe you have a succinct way\nof describing quantum Internet,but that would be better.And if so, please offer it up.But is quantum Internet going\nto be one way to secure thesekinds of data and resources?Marc Andreessen: Maybe in the\nfuture, years in the future?We don't yet have working quantum\ncomputers in practice, so it'snot currently something you could\ndo, but maybe in a decade or two?Andrew Huberman: Tell me.I'm going to take a stab at defining\nquantum Internet in one sentence.It's a way in which if anyone were to\ntry and peer in on a conversation on theInternet, it essentially would be futile\nbecause of the way that quantum Internetchanges the way that the communication is\nhappening so fast and so many times in anyone conversation, essentially changing the\ntranslation or the language so fast thatthere's just no way to keep up with it.Is that more or less accurate?Marc Andreessen: Yeah,\nconceivably not yet, but someday.Andrew Huberman: So, going\nback to AI, most people whohear about AI are afraid of AI."

interesting.Well, I heard you say that, a his is from\na really wonderful tweet thread that wewill link in the show note captions that\nyou put out not long ago and that I'veread now several times, and that everyone\nreally should take the time to read it.Probably takes about 20 minutes to\nread it carefully and to think abouteach piece, and I highly recommend it.But you said, and I'm quoting\nhere, \"Let's address the fifth, theone thing I actually agree with,\nwhich is AI will make it easierfor bad people to do bad things.\"Marc Andreessen: First of all, there is\na general freak out happening around AI.I think it's primarily, it's one of these,\nagain, it's an elite driven freak out.I don't think the man in the street knows,\ncares, or feels one way or the other.It's just not a relevant concept, and it\nprobably just sounds like science fiction.So I think there's an elite driven\nfreak out that's happening right now.I think that elite driven freak out\nhas many aspects to it that I thinkare incorrect, which is not surprising.I would think that, given that.I think the elites are incorrect\nabout a lot of things, but I thinkthey're very wrong about a number\nof things they're saying about AI.But that said, look, this is a very\npowerful new technology, right?This is like a new general\npurpose thinking technology.So what if machines could think?And what if you could use machines\nthat think, and what if youcould have them think for you?There's obviously a lot of\ngood that could come from that.But also, people, look, criminals\ncould use them to plan better crimes.Terrorists could use them to plan\nbetter terror attacks and so forth.And so these are going to be\ntools that bad people can useto do bad things, for sure.Andrew Huberman: I can think\nof some ways that AI could beleveraged to do fantastic things.Like in the realm of medicine, an AI\npathologist perhaps, can scan 10,000slides of histology and find the one\nmicro tumor, cellular aberration, thatwould turn into a full blown tumor,\nwhereas the even mildly fatigued orwell rested human pathologists, as\ngreat as they come, might miss that.And perhaps the best solution is\nfor both of them to do it, and thenfor the human to verify what the\nAI has found and vice versa, right?Marc Andreessen: That's right.Andrew Huberman: And\nthat's just one example.I mean, I can come up with thousands of\nexamples where this would be wonderful.Marc Andreessen: I'll give you\nanother one, by the way, medicine.So you're talking about an analytic\nresult, which is good and important.The other is like, the machines are going\nto be much better at bedside manner.They're going to be much better\nat dealing with the patient.And we already know there's\nalready been a study.There's already been a study on this.So there was already a study done on\nthis where there was a study team thatscraped thousands of medical questions\noff of an Internet forum, and then theyhad real doctors answer the questions,\nand then they had basically GPT4 answerthe questions, and then they had another\npanel of doctors score the responses.So there were no patients\nexperimented on here.This was a test contained\nwithin the medical world.The judges, the panel of doctors\nwho are the judges, scored theanswers in both factual accuracy\nand on bedside manner, on empathy.And the GPT4 was equal or better\non most of the factual questionsanalytically, already, and it's not even\na specifically trained medical AI, butit was overwhelmingly better on empathy.Andrew Huberman: Amazing,Marc Andreessen: Right?Do you treat patients\ndirectly in your work?You don't?Andrew Huberman: No, I don't.We run clinical trials.Marc Andreessen: Right.Andrew Huberman: But I don't\ndo any direct clinical work.Marc Andreessen: I've no\ndirect experience with this.But from the surgeons, if you talk\nto surgeons or you talk to people whotrain surgeons, what they'll tell you\nis surgeons need to have an emotionalremove from their patients in order\nto do a good job with the surgery.The side effect of that, and by the way,\nlook, it's a hell of a job to have togo in and tell somebody that they're\ngoing to die or that they have so you'renever going to recover, they're never\ngoing to walk again or whatever it is.And so there's sort of something\ninherent in that job where they needto keep an emotional reserve from\nthe patient to be able to do the job.And it's expected of\nthem as professionals.The machine has no such limitation.The machine can be as sympathetic\nas you want it to be for aslong as you want it to be.It can be infinitely sympathetic.It's happy to talk to you\nat four in the morning.It's happy to sympathize with you.And by the way, it's not just\nsympathizing with you in the waythat, oh, it's just making up words\nto lie to you to make you feel good.It can also sympathize with you in\nterms of helping you through allthe things that you can actually\ndo to improve your situation.And so, boy, can you keep a\npatient actually on track witha physical therapy program.Can you keep a patient on track\nwith a nutritional program?Can you keep a patient\noff of drugs or alcohol?And if they have a machine medical\ncompanion that's with them all thetime that they're talking to all\nthe time, that's infinitely patient,infinitely wise, infinitely loving,\nand it's just going to be there all thetime and it's going to be encouraging\nand it's going to be, you know, youdid such a great job yesterday, I\nknow you can do this again today.Cognitive behavioral therapy\nis an obvious fit here.These things are going to be great\nat CBT and that's already starting.You can already use ChatGPT as\na CBT therapist if you want.It's actually quite good at it.There's, there's a universe here\nthat's, it goes to what you said,there's a universe here that's opening\nup, which is what I believe is it'spartnership between man and machine.It's a symbiotic relationship,\nnot an adversarial relationship.And so the doctor is going to pair\nwith the AI to do all the thingsthat you described, but the patient\nis also going to pair with the AI.And I think this partnership that's\ngoing to emerge is going to lead,among other things, to actually\nmuch better health outcomes.Andrew Huberman: I've relied for so much\nof my life on excellent mentors from

a frequent basis.And they fatigue like anybody else, and\nthey have their own stuff like anybodyelse, baggage, events in their life, etc.What you're describing is a sort of\nAI coach or therapist of sorts, thathopefully would learn to identify our best\nself and encourage us to be our best self.And when I say best self, I don't mean\nthat in any kind of pop psychology way.I could imagine AI very easily knowing\nhow well I slept the night before andwhat types of good or bad decisions I tend\nto make at 02:00 in the afternoon whenI've only had 5 hours of sleep, or maybe\njust less REM sleep the night before.It might encourage me to take a little\nmore time to think about something.Might give me a little tap on the\nwrist through a device that no one elsewould detect to refrain from something.Marc Andreessen: Never going to judge you.It's never going to be resentful.It's never going to be upset\nthat you didn't listen to it.It's never going to go on vacation.It's going to be there for you.I think this is the way\npeople are going to live.It's going to start with kids, and\nthen over time it's going to be adults.I think the way people are going\nto live is they're going to havea friend, therapist, companion,\nmentor, coach, teacher, assistant.Or, by the way, maybe multiple of those.It may be that we're actually talking\nabout six, like, different personasinteracting, which is a whole 'nother\npossibility, but they're going to have--Andrew Huberman: --A committee!Marc Andreessen: A\ncommittee, yeah, exactly.Actually different personas.And maybe, by the way, when there are\ndifficult decisions to be made in yourlife, maybe what you want to hear is the\nargument among the different personas.And so you're just going to grow up,\nyou're just going to have this inyour life and you're going to always\nbe able to talk to it and alwaysbe able to learn from it and always\nbe able to help it make, it's goingto be a symbiotic relationship.I think it's going to be\na much better way to live.I think people are going\nto get a lot out of it.Andrew Huberman: What\nmodalities will it include?So I can imagine my phone has\nthis engine in it, this AIcompanion, and I'm listening in\nheadphones as I walk into work.And it's giving me some, not just\nencouragement, some warnings, somethoughts that things that I might\nask Marc Andreessen today that Imight not have thought of and so on.I could also imagine it\nhaving a more human form.I could imagine it being tactile,\nhaving some haptic, so tapping toremind me so that it's not going\nto enter our conversation in a waythat interferes or distracts you.But I would be aware.Oh, right.Things of that sort.I mean, how many different modalities\nare we going to allow these AIcoaches to approach us with?And is anyone actually thinking\nabout the hardware piece right now?Because I'm hearing a lot\nabout the software piece.What does the hardware piece look like?Marc Andreessen: Yeah, so this is where\nSilicon Valley is going to kick in.So the entrepreneurial community is\ngoing to try all of those, right?By the way, the big companies and\nstartups are going to try all those.And so obviously there's big\ncompanies that are working, the bigcompanies that have talked about a\nvariety of these, including headsup displays, AR, VR kinds of things.There's lots of people doing voice.Thing is, voice is a real possibility.It may just be an earpiece.There's a new startup that just unveiled\na new thing where they actually project.So you'll have like a pendant you wear\non like a necklace, and it actuallyprojects, literally, it'll project\nimages on your hand or on the tableor on the wall in front of you.So maybe that's how it shows up.Yeah.There are people working on so-called\nhaptic or touch based kinds of things.There are people working on\nactually picking up nervesignals, like out of your arm.There's some science for being able\nto do basically like subvocalization.So maybe you could pick up\nthat way by bone conduction.These are all going to be tried.So that's one question is the physical\nform of it, and then the otherquestion is the software version of\nit, which is like, okay, what's thelevel of abstraction that you want to\ndeal with these things in right now?It's like a question answer paradigm, so\ncalled chatbot, like, ask a question, getan answer, ask a question, get an answer.Well, you want that to go for sure\nto more of a fluid conversation.You want it to build up more\nknowledge of who you are, andyou don't want to have to explain\nyourself a second time and so forth.And then you want to be able to tell\nit things like, well, remind me this,that, or be sure and tell me when X.But then maybe over time, more and\nmore, you want it actually decidingwhen it's going to talk to you, right?And when it thinks it has\nsomething to say, it says it,and otherwise it stays silent.Andrew Huberman: Normally, at\nleast in my head, unless I make aconcerted effort to do otherwise, I\ndon't think in complete sentences.So presumably these machines could learn\nmy style of fragmented internal dialogue.And maybe I have an earpiece, and\nI'm walking in and I start hearingsomething, but it's some advice,\netc, encouragement, discouragement.But at some point, those sounds\nthat I hear in an earphone are verydifferent than seeing something\nor hearing something in the room.We know this based on the\nneuroscience of musical perceptionand language perception.Hearing something in your\nhead is very different.And I could imagine at some point that\nthe AI will cross a precipice where ifit has inline wiring to actually control\nneural activity in specific brain areas,and I don't mean very precisely, even\njust stimulating a little more prefrontalcortical activity, for instance, through\nthe earpiece, a little ultrasound wavenow can stimulate prefrontal cortex\nin a non invasive way that's beingused clinically and experimentally,\nthat the AI could decide that I needto be a little bit more context aware.This is something that is very beneficial\nfor those listening that are trying tofigure out how to navigate through life.It's like, you know, the context you're\nin and know the catalog of behaviorsand words that are appropriate for that\nsituation and not, you know, this wouldgo along with agreeableness, perhaps,\nbut strategic agreeableness, right.Context is important.There's nothing diabolical about that.Context is important, but I could\nimagine the AI recognizing we'reentering a particular environment.I'm now actually going to ramp up activity\nin prefrontal cortex a little bit in acertain way that allows you to be more\nsituationally aware of yourself andothers, which is great, unless I can't\nnecessarily short circuit that influence,because at some point, the AI is actually\nthen controlling my brain activityand my decision making and my speech.I think that's what people fear is that\nonce we cross that precipice that weare giving up control to the artificial\nversions of our human intelligence.Marc Andreessen: And look, I think\nwe have to decide, we collectively,and we as individuals, I think, have\nto decide exactly how to do that.And this is the big thing\nthat I believe about AI.That's just a much more, I would\nsay, practical view of the world thana lot of the panic that you hear.It's just like, these are machines.They're able to do things that\nincreasingly are like the things thatpeople can do in some circumstances.But these are machines.We built a machine, means we\ndecide how to use the machines.When we want the machines turned\non, they're turned on, we want themturned off, they're turned off.I think that's absolutely the kind\nof thing that the individual personshould always be in charge of.Andrew Huberman: Everyone was."

and deleting\nparticular genes in adulthood.Not having to recombine in the womb.A new organism is an\nimmensely powerful tool.And yet the Chinese scientist who\ndid CRISPR on humans, this has beendone, actually did his postdoc at\nStanford with Steve Quake, thenwent to China, did CRISPR on babies.Mutated something.I believe it was one of the HIV receptors.I'm told it was with the intention\nof augmenting human memory.It had very little to do, in fact,\nwith limiting susceptibility toHIV per se, to do with the way that\nreceptor is involved in human memory.The world demonized that person.We actually don't know\nwhat happened to them.Whether or not they have a laboratory now\nor they're sitting in jail, it's unclear.But in China and elsewhere,\npeople are doing CRISPR on humans.We know this.It's not legal in the US and other\ncountries, but it's happening.Do you think it's a mistake for us to fear\nthese technologies so much that we backaway from them and end up 10, 20 years\nbehind other countries that could use itfor both benevolent or malevolent reasons?Marc Andreessen: Yeah, the details matter.So it's technology by technology.But I would say there's two things\nyou always have to think about inthese questions, I think, in terms of\ncounterfactuals and opportunity cost.CRISPR is an interesting one.CRISPR manipulates the human genome.Nature manipulates the human,\nlike, in all kinds of ways.[LAUGHS]\nAndrew Huberman: Yeah.[LAUGHS]Marc Andreessen: When you\npick a spouse and you--Andrew Huberman: --Have a\nchild with that spouse--Marc Andreessen: --Oh, boy--Andrew Huberman: --You're\ndoing genetic recombination.Marc Andreessen: Yes, you are.Quite possibly, if you're Genghis\nKhan, you're determining the futureof humanity by those mutations.This is the old question of,\nbasically, this is all state ofnature, state of grace, basically.Is nature good?And then therefore, artificial things\nare bad, which is kind of shot.A lot of people have\nethical views like that.I'm always of the view that nature\nis a bitch and wants us dead.Nature is out to get us, man.Nature wants to kill us, right?Like, nature wants to evolve\nall kinds of horrible viruses.Nature wants plagues.Nature wants to do weather.Nature wants to do all kinds of stuff.I mean, look, nature religion\nwas the original religion, right?Like, that was the original\nthing people worshiped.And the reason was because nature was the\nthing that was out to get you right beforeyou had scientific and technological\nmethods to be able to deal with it.So, the idea of not doing these\nthings, to me is just saying, oh,we're just going to turn over the\nfuture of everything to nature.And I think that there's no reason\nto believe that that leads in aparticularly good direction or that\nthat's not a value neutral decision.And then the related thing that comes\nfrom that is always this question aroundwhat's called the precautionary principle,\nwhich shows up in all these conversationson things like CRISPR, which basically is\nthis principle that basically says, theinventors of a new technology should be\nrequired to prove that it will not havenegative effects before they roll it out.This, of course, is a very new idea.This is actually a new idea in the 1970s.It's actually invented\nby the German Greens.The 1970s.Before that, people didn't\nthink in those terms.People just invented\nthings and rolled them out.And we got all of modern\ncivilization by people inventingthings and rolling them out.The German Greens came up with\nthe precautionary principlefor one specific purpose.I'll bet you can guess what it is.It was to prevent...?Andrew Huberman: Famine?Marc Andreessen: Nuclear power.It was to shut down attempts\nto do civilian nuclear power.And if you fast forward 50 years later,\nyou're like, wow, that was a big mistake.So what they said at the time was,\nyou have to prove that nuclearreactors are not going to melt down\nand cause all kinds of problems.And, of course, as an engineer, can\nyou prove that will never happen?You can't.You can't rule out things that\nmight happen in the future.And so that philosophy was used to\nstop nuclear power by the way, notjust in Europe, but also in the US and\naround much of the rest of the world.If you're somebody who's concerned\nabout carbon emissions, of course, thisis the worst thing that happened in\nthe last 50 years in terms of energy.We actually have the silver bullet\nanswer to unlimited energy with zerocarbon emissions, nuclear power.We choose not to do it.Not only do we choose not to do it,\nwe're actually shutting down theplants that we have now in California.We just shut down the big plant.Germany just shut down their plants.Germany is in the middle of an energy\nwar with Russia that, we are informed,is existential for the future of Europe.Andrew Huberman: But unless the risk\nof nuclear power plant meltdown hasincreased, and I have to imagine\nit's gone the other way, what isthe rationale behind shutting down\nthese plants and not expanding?Marc Andreessen: Because nuclear is bad.Right.\nNuclear is icky.Nuclear has been tagged.Andrew Huberman: It just sounds bad.Nuclear.Marc Andreessen: Yeah.Andrew Huberman: Go nuclear.Marc Andreessen: Well, so what happened?Andrew Huberman: We didn't shut down\npostal offices and you hear go postal.Marc Andreessen: So what happened\nwas, so nuclear technology arrivedon planet Earth as a weapon, right?So it arrived in the form of.The first thing they did was\nin the middle of World War II.The first thing they did was the\natomic bomb they dropped on Japan.And then there were all the\ndebates that followed aroundnuclear weapons and disarmament.And there's a whole conversation\nto be had, by the way, aboutthat, because there's different\nviews you could have on that.And then it was in the.Where they started to roll\nout civilian nuclear power.And then there were accidents.There was like, three Mile island\nmelted down, and then Chernobyl melteddown in the Soviet Union, and then\neven recently, Fukushima melted down.And so there have been meltdowns.And so I think it was a\ncombination of it's a weapon.It is sort of icky scientists\nsometimes with the ick factor, right.It glows green.And by the way, it becomes like\na mythical fictional thing.And so you have all these movies of\nhorrible supervillains powered bynuclear energy and all this stuff.Andrew Huberman: Well, the\nintro to the Simpsons, right.Is the nuclear power plant and the\nthree eyed fish and all the negativeimplications of this nuclear power plant\nrun by, at least in the Simpsons idiots.And that is the dystopia, where\npeople are unaware of just how bad it.Marc Andreessen: Is and who\nowns the nuclear power plant.Right.\nThis evil capitalist.Right.So it's connected to capitalism.Right.Andrew Huberman: We're blaming Matt\nGronig for the demise of a particular--Marc Andreessen: --He\ncertainly didn't help.But it's literally, this amazing thing\nwhere if you're just like, thinking.If you're just thinking rationally,\nscientifically, you're like, okay,we want to get rid of carbon.This is the obvious way to do it.Okay, fun fact."

nuclear plants, civiliannuclear plants, in the US by 1980.And to get the US completely off of\noil and cut the entire US energy gridover to nuclear power, electricity,\ncut over to electric cars, the wholething, like, detach from carbon.You'll notice that didn't happen.Why did that not happen?Because he also created the EPA and the\nNuclear Regulatory Commission, whichthen prevented that from happening.Right.And the Nuclear Regulatory Commission\ndid not authorize a new nuclearplant in the US for 40 years.Andrew Huberman: Why would he\nhamstring himself like that?Marc Andreessen: He got distracted\nby Watergate in Vietnam.Andrew Huberman: I think Ellsberg\njust died recently, right?The guy who released the Pentagon papers.Marc Andreessen: Yeah.\nAndrew Huberman: So complicated.Marc Andreessen: Yeah, exactly.It's this thing.He left office shortly thereafter.He didn't have time to\nfully figure this out.I don't know whether he would\nhave figured it out or know.Look, Ford could have figured it out.Carter could have figured it out.Reagan could have figured it out.Any of these guys could\nhave figured it out.It's like the most obvious.Knowing what we know today, it's\nthe most obvious thing in the world.The Russia thing is the amazing thing.It's like Europe is literally\nfunding Russia's invasion of Ukraineby paying them for oil, right?And they can't shut off the oil because\nthey won't cut over to nuclear, right?And then, of course, what happens?Okay, so then here's the other\nkicker of what happens, right?Which is they won't do nuclear, but\nthey want to do renewables, right?Sustainable energy.And so what they do is\nthey do solar and wind.Solar and wind are not reliable\nbecause it sometimes gets dark outand sometimes the wind doesn't blow.And so then what happens is they\nfire up the coal plants, right?And so the actual consequence of\nthe precautionary principle forthe purpose it was invented is\na massive spike in use of coal.Andrew Huberman: That's\ntaking us back over 100 years.Marc Andreessen: Yes.Correct.That is the consequence of\nthe cautionary principle.That's the consequence of that mentality.And so it's a failure of a\nprinciple on its own meritsfor the thing it was designed.Then, you know, there's a whole\nmovement of people who want toapply it to every new thing.And this is the hot topic on AI right\nnow in Washington, which is like, ohmy God, these people have to prove that\nthis can never get used for bad things.Andrew Huberman: Sorry, I'm\nhung up on this nuclear thing.And I wonder, can it just be?I mean, there is something\nabout the naming of things.We know this in, I mean, you know,\nLamarckian evolution and things like that.These are bad words in biology.But we had a guest on this podcast,\nOded Rechavii, who's over in Israel,who's shown inherited traits.But if you talk about his Lamarckian, then\nit has all sorts of negative implications.But his discoveries have important\nimplications for everything frominherited trauma to treatment of disease.I mean, there's all sorts of positives\nthat await us if we are able to reframeour thinking around something that,\nyes, indeed, could be used for evil,but that has enormous potential and\nthat is in agreement with nature, right?This fundamental truth that at least\nto my knowledge, no one is revisingin any significant way anytime soon.So what if it were called something else?It could be nuclear.It's called sustainable, right?I mean, it's amazing how marketing\ncan shift our perspectiveof robots, for instance.Or anyway, I'm sure you can come\nup with better examples than Ican, but is there a good, solid PR\nfirm working from the nuclear side?Marc Andreessen: Thunbergian.Greta Thunberg.Andrew Huberman: Thunbergian.Marc Andreessen: Thunbergian.Like if she was in favor of it,\nwhich by the way, she's not.She's dead set against it.Andrew Huberman: She said that 100%.Marc Andreessen: Yeah.Andrew Huberman: Based on.Marc Andreessen: Based on\nThunbergian principles.The prevailing ethic in environmentalism\nfor 50 years is that nuclear is evil.Like, they won't consider it.There are, by the way, certain\nenvironmentalists who disagree with this.And so Stuart Brand is the one that's\nbeen the most public, and he hasimpeccable credentials in the space.Andrew Huberman: And he\nwrote Whole Earth Catalog.\n Marc Andreessen: Whole Earth Catalog guy.Yeah.And he's written a whole bunch\nof really interesting book since.And he wrote a recent book\nthat goes through in detail.He's like, yes, obviously\nthe correct environmentalthing to do is nuclear power.And we should be implementing\nproject independence.We should be building a thousand.Specifically, he didn't say this,\nbut this is what I would say.We should hire Charles Koch.We should hire Koch Industries and\nthey should build us a thousand nuclearpower plants, and then we should\ngive them the presidential Medal ofFreedom for saving the environment.Andrew Huberman: And that would put\nus independent of our reliance on oil.Marc Andreessen: Yeah.Then we're done with.We're just, think about what happens.We're done with oil, zero emissions,\nwe're done with the Middle East.We're done.We're done.We're not drilling on\nAmerican land anymore.We're not drilling on foreign land.Like, we have no military entanglements in\nplaces where we're not despoiling Alaska.We're not, nothing.No offshore rigs, no nothing.We're done.And basically just you build state of\nthe art plants, engineered properly,you have them just completely contained.When there's nuclear waste, you\njust entomb the waste in concrete.So it just sits there forever.It's just a very small\nfootprint kind of thing.And you're just done.And so to me, it's like scientifically,\ntechnologically, this is just likethe most obvious thing in the world.It's a massive tell on the part of the\npeople who claim to be pro-environmentthat they're not in favor of this.Andrew Huberman: And if I were to\nsay, tweet that I'm pro nuclear powerbecause it's the more sustainable form\nof power, if I hypothetically did thattoday, what would happen to me in this.Marc Andreessen: You'd be a\ncryptofascist.] LAUGHS] Dirty,evil, capitalist monster.How dare you?Andrew Huberman: I'm unlikely\nto run that experiment.I was just curious.That was what we call\na Gedanken experiment.Marc Andreessen: Andrew,\nyou're a terrible human being.We were looking for evidence that you're a\nterrible human being, and now we know it.This is a great example of the, I\ngave Andrew a book on the way inhere with this, my favorite new book.The title of it is When Reason Goes on\nHoliday , and this is a great exampleof it is, the people who simultaneously\nsay they're environmentalists andsay they're anti nuclear power.Like the positions just\nsimply don't reconcile.But that doesn't bother them at all.So be clear.I predict none of this will happen.Andrew Huberman: Amazing.I need to learn more about nuclear power.Marc Andreessen: Long coal.Andrew Huberman: Long coal.Marc Andreessen: Long coal.\nInvest in coal.Andrew Huberman: Because you\nthink we're just going to revert?Marc Andreessen: It's the\nenergy source of the future.Well, because it can't be solar and\nwind, because they're not reliable.So you need something.If it's not nuclear, it's going to be\neither like oil, natural gas, or coal.Andrew Huberman: And you're unwilling\nto say bet on nuclear because you don'tthink that the sociopolitical elitist\ntrends that are driving against nuclearare likely to dissipate anytime soon.Marc Andreessen: Not a chance.I can't imagine it would\nbe great if they did.But the powers that be are very\nlocked in on this as a position.And look, they've been saying this\nfor 50 years, and so they'd haveto reverse themselves off of a bad\nposition they've had for 50 years.And people really don't like to do that.Andrew Huberman: One thing that's\ngood about this and other podcastsis that young people listen and\nthey eventually will take over.Marc Andreessen: And by the way, I will\nsay also there are nuclear entrepreneurs.So on the point of young kids, there are\na bunch of young entrepreneurs who arebasically not taking no for an answer.And they're trying to develop, in\nparticular, there's people tryingto develop new, very small form\nfactor nuclear power plants witha variety of possible use cases.So, look, maybe they show up with\na better mousetrap and peopletake a second look, but we'll see.Andrew Huberman: Just rename it.So, my understanding is that\nyou think we should go all in on"

what we\nshould have done with nuclear power.Andrew Huberman: And in terms of the near\ninfinite number of ways that AI can beenvisioned to harm us, how do you think\nwe should cope with that psychologically?Because I can imagine a lot of people\nlistening to this conversation arethinking, okay, that all sounds\ngreat, but there are just too manywhat ifs that are terrible, right?What if the machines take over?What if the silly example I gave\nearlier, but what if one day Icould log into my hard earned\nbank account and it's all gone?The AI version of myself ran off with\nsomeone else, and with all my money, myAI coach abandoned me for somebody else.After it learned all the\nstuff that I taught it.It took off with somebody else stranded.And it has my bank account\nnumbers, like this kind of thing.Marc Andreessen: You could really\nmake this scenario horrible,right, if you kept going?Andrew Huberman: Yeah, well, we can\nthrow in a benevolent example as well tocounter it, but it's kind of fun to think\nabout where the human mind goes, right?Marc Andreessen: Yeah.So first I say we've got to separate the\nreal problems from the fake problems.And so there's a lot.A lot of the science fiction\nscenarios I think are just not real.And the ones that you decided\nas an example, like, it's.That's not what is going to happen.And I can explain why that's\nnot what's going to happen.There's a set of fake ones, and the\nfake ones are the ones that justaren't, I think, technologically\ngrounded, that aren't rational.It's the AI is going to wake\nup and decide to kill us all.It's going to develop the kind of agency\nwhere it's going to steal our money andour spouse and everything else, our kids.That's not how it works.And then there's also all these concerns,\ndestruction of society concerns.And this is misinformation, hate speech,\ndeepfakes, like all that stuff, which Idon't think is actually a real problem.And then people have a bunch of economic\nconcerns around what's going to take allthe jobs and all those kinds of things.We could talk about that.I don't think that's actually\nthe thing that happens.But then there are two actual\nreal concerns that I actuallydo very much agree with.And one of them is what you said,\nwhich is bad people doing bad things.And there's a whole set of\nthings to be done inside there.The big one is we should use\nAI to build defenses againstall the bad things, right?And so, for example, there's a\nconcern AI is going to make it easierfor bad people to build pathogens,\ndesign pathogens in labs, which badscientists can do today, but this is\ngoing to make it easier, easier to do.Well, obviously, we should have the\nequivalent of an Operation Warpspeed,operating in perpetuity anyway.But then we should use AI to\nbuild much better bio defenses.And we should be using AI today to design,\nlike, for example, full spectrum vaccinesagainst every possible form of pathogen.So defensive mechanism hacking,\nyou can use AI to buildbetter defense tools, right?And so you should have a whole new\nkind of security suite wrapped aroundyou, wrapped around your data, wrapped\naround your money, where you're havingAI repel attacks, disinformation, hate\nspeech, deepfakes, all that stuff.You should have an AI filter when you\nuse the Internet, where you shouldn'thave to figure out whether it's really\nme or whether it's a made up thing.You should have an AI assistant\nthat's doing that for you.Andrew Huberman: Oh, yeah.I mean, these little banners and cloaks\nthat you see on social media like\"this has been deemed misinformation.\"If you're me, you always click because\nyou're like, what's behind the scrim?I don't always look at this\nimage is gruesome type thing.Sometimes I just pass on that.But if it's something that seems\ndebatable, of course you look well.Marc Andreessen: And you should\nhave an AI assistant with youwhen you're on the Internet.And you should be able to tell that\nAI assistant what you want, right?So, yes, I want the full experience.Show me everything.I want it from a particular point of view.And I don't want to hear from these other\npeople who I don't like, by the way.It's going to be, my eight\nyear old is using this.I don't want anything that's\ngoing to cause a problem.And I want everything filtered and\nAI based filters like that that youprogram and control are going to work\nmuch better and be much more honestand straightforward and clear and\nso forth than what we have today.Anyway, basically, what I want people\nto do is think, every time you thinkof a risk of how it can be used,\njust think of like, okay, we canuse it to build a countermeasure.And the great thing about\nthe countermeasures is theycan not only offset AI risks,\nthey can offset other risks.Right?Because we already live in a world\nwhere pathogens are a problem, right?We ought to have better vaccines anyway.We already live in a world where there's\ncyber hacking and cyber terrorism.They already live in a world where\nthere's bad content on the Internet.And we have the ability now to\nbuild much better AI powered toolsto deal with all those things.Andrew Huberman: I also love\nthe idea of the AI physicians.Getting decent health care in this\ncountry is so difficult, even forpeople who have means or insurance.I mean, the number of phone calls and\nwaits that you have to go through to get areferral to see a specialist, it's absurd.The process is absurd.I mean, it makes one partially or\nfrankly ill just to go through theprocess of having to do all that.I don't know how anyone does it.And granted, I don't have the highest\ndegree of patience, but I'm prettypatient, and it drives me insane\nto even just get remedial care.So I can think of a lot\nof benevolent uses of AI.And I'm grateful that you're bringing\nthis up and here and that you'vetweeted about it in that thread.Again, we'll refer people to that.And that you're thinking about this.I have to imagine that in your\nrole as investor nowadays, thatyou're also thinking about AI quite\noften in terms of all these roles."

            "text": "And so does that mean that there are\na lot of young people who are reallybullish on AI and are going for it?Marc Andreessen: Yeah.\nOkay.Andrew Huberman: This is here to stay.Marc Andreessen: Okay.Andrew Huberman: Unlike CRISPR, which\nis sort of in this liminal place wherebiotech companies aren't sure if they\nshould invest or not in CRISPR becauseit's unclear whether or not the governing\nbodies are going to allow gene editing,just like it was unclear 15 years ago if\nthey were going to allow gene therapy.But now we know they do allow\ngene therapy and immunotherapy.Marc Andreessen: Okay,\nso there is a fight.Having said that, there is a fight.There's a fight happening in\nWashington right now over exactlywhat should be legal or not legal.And there's quite a bit of risk, I\nthink, attached to that fight rightnow because there are some people in\nthere that are telling a very effectivestory to try to get people to either\noutlaw AI or specifically limit it toa small number of big companies, which\nI think is potentially disastrous.By the way, the EU also\nis, like, super negative.The EU has turned super negative on\nbasically all new technology, so they'removing to try to outlaw AI, which if\nthey outlaw AI, flat out don't want it.Andrew Huberman: But that's like saying\nyou're going to outlaw the Internet.I don't see how you can stop this train.Marc Andreessen: And frankly, they're\nnot a big fan of the Internet either.So I think they regret the EU has a very,\nespecially the EU bureaucrats, the peoplewho run the EU in Brussels have a very\nnegative view on a lot of modernity.Andrew Huberman: But what I'm\nhearing calls to mind things thatI've heard people like David Goggins\nsay, which is, you know, there'sso many lazy, undisciplined people\nout there that nowadays it's easierand easier to become exceptional.I've heard him say\nsomething to that extent.It almost sounds like there's so many\ncountries that are just backing off ofparticular technologies because it just\nsounds bad from the PR perspective thatit's creating great, kind of, low hanging\nfruit, opportunities for people to bargeforward and countries to barge forward.If they're willing to embrace this stuff.Marc Andreessen: It is, but\nnumber one, you have to have acountry that wants to do that.Those exist, and there\nare countries like that.And then the other is, look, they\nneed to be able to withstand theattack from stronger countries that\ndon't want them to do it, right?So the EU, the EU has nominal\ncontrol over whatever it is, 27or whatever member countries.So even if you're like, whatever\nthe Germans get all fired up about,whatever, Brussels can still, in a lot\nof cases, just like flat out, basicallycontrol them and tell them not to do it.And then the US, you know, we have a\nlot of control over a lot of the world.Andrew Huberman: But it sounds like\nwe sit somewhere sort of in between.Like right now, people are developing\nAI technologies in US companies, r ight?So it is happening.Marc Andreessen: Yeah,\ntoday it's happening.But like I said, there's a set of people\nwho are very focused in Washingtonright now about trying to either ban it\noutright or trying to, as I said, limitit to a small number of big companies.And then, look, China's got a whole, the\nother part of this is China's got a wholedifferent kind of take on this than we do.And so they're, of course, going\nto allow it for sure, but they'regoing to allow it in the ways that\ntheir system wants it to happen.Right.Which is much more for population control\nand to implement authoritarianism.And then, of course, they are\ngoing to spread their technologyand their vision of how society\nshould run across the world.So we're back in a Cold War dynamic\nlike we were with the Soviet Union,where there are two different systems\nthat have fundamentally different viewson issues, concepts like freedom and\nindividual choice and freedom of speech.And so, you know, we know\nwhere the Chinese stand.We're still figuring out where we stand.I'm having specifically a lot of\nschizophrenic conversations withpeople in DC right now, where if\nI talk to them and China doesn'tcome up, they just hate tech.They hate American tech companies,\nthey hate AI, they hate social media,they hate this, they hate that, they\nhate crypto, they hate everything,and they just want to punish and\nban, and they're just very negative.But then if we have a conversation a half\nhour later and we talk about China, thenthe conversation is totally different.Now we need a partnership between\nthe US government and Americantech companies to defeat China.It's like the exact opposite discussion.Right?Andrew Huberman: Is that fear or\ncompetitiveness on China specificallyin terms of the US response in, you\nknow, you bring up these technologies,know, I'll lump CRISPR in there\nthings like CRISPR, nuclear power, AI.It all sounds very cold, very\ndystopian to a lot of people.And yet there are all these benevolent\nuses as we've been talking about.And then you say you raise the\nissue of China and then it soundslike this big dark cloud emerging.And then all of a sudden, we need\nto galvanize and develop thesetechnologies to counter their effort.So is it fear of them or is\nit competitiveness or both?Marc Andreessen: Well, so without them\nin the picture, you just have this.Basically there's an old Bedouin saying\nas me against my brother, me and mybrother against my cousin, me and my\nbrother and my cousin against the world.It's actually, it's evolution in\naction, I think we'd think about it,is if there's no external threat, then\nthe conflict turns inward, and thenat that point, there's a big fight\nbetween specifically, tech, and thenI was just say, generally politics.And my interpretation of that\nfight is it's a fight for status.It's fundamentally a fight for status\nand for power, which is like, if you'rein politics, you like the status quo of\nhow power and status work in our society.You don't want these new technologies\nto show up and change things,because change is bad, right?Change threatens your position.It threatens the respect that people have\nfor you and your control over things.And so I think it's primarily a status\nfight, which we could talk about.But the China thing is just like a\nstraight up geopolitical us versus them.Like I said, it's like\na Cold War scenario.And look, 20 years ago, the prevailing\nview in Washington was, we needto be friends with China, right?And we're going to be\ntrading partners with China.And yes, they're a totalitarian\ndictatorship, but if we trade with them,over time, they'll become more democratic.In the last five to ten years,\nit's become more and more clearthat that's just not true.And now there's a lot of people in both\npolitical parties in DC who very muchregret that and want to change too much,\nmore of a sort of a Cold War footing.Andrew Huberman: Are you willing to\ncomment on TikTok and technologies"

            "text": "that emerge from China that are in\nwidespread use within the US, like howmuch you trust them or don't trust them?I can go on record myself by saying\nthat early on, when TikTok was released,we were told, as Stanford faculty,\nthat we should not and could not haveTikTok accounts nor WeChat accounts.Marc Andreessen: So to start with,\nthere are a lot of really brightChinese tech entrepreneurs and engineers\nwho are trying to do good things.I'm totally positive about that.So I think many of the people mean\nvery well, but the Chinese havea specific system, and the system\nis very clear and unambiguous.And the system is, everything\nin China is owned by the party.It's not even owned by the state.It's owned by the party.\nIt's owned by the Chinese Communist Party.So the Chinese Communist Party owns\neverything, and they control everything.By the way, it's actually\nillegal to this day.It's illegal for an investor to\nbuy equity in a Chinese company.There's all these basically legal\nmachinations that people do to tryto do something that's like the\neconomic equivalent to that, but it'sactually still illegal to do that.The Chinese Communist Party\nhas no intention of lettingforeigners own any of China.Like, zero intention of that.And they regularly move to make\nsure that that doesn't happen.So they own everything.They control everything.Andrew Huberman: Sorry to interrupt\nyou, but people in China can investin American companies all the time.Marc Andreessen: Well, they can,\nsubject to US government constraints.There is a US government system\nthat attempts to mediate that calledCFIUS, and there are more and more\nlimitations being put on that.But if you can get through that\napproval process, then legally youcan do that, whereas the same is\nnot true with respect to China.So they just have a system.And so if you're the CEO of a\nChinese company, it's not optional.If you're the CEO of ByteDance,\nCEO of Tencent, your relationshipwith the Chinese Communist Party\nis not optional, it's required.And what's required is you are a\nunit of the party and you and yourcompany do what the party says.And when the party says we get full access\nto all user data in America, you say yes.When the party says you change the\nalgorithm to optimize to a certainsocial result, you say whatever.It's whatever Xi Jinping and\nhis party cadres decide, andthat's what gets implemented.If you're the CEO of a Chinese\ntech company, there is a politicalofficer assigned to you who\nhas an office down the hall.And at any given time, he can come\ndown the hall, he can grab you out ofyour staff meeting or board meeting,\nand he can take you down the halland he can make you sit for hours and\nstudy Marxism and Xi Jinping thoughtand quiz you on it and test you on it,\nand you'd better pass the test, Right?So it's like a straight\npolitical control thing.And then, by the way, if you\nget crossways with them, like...Andrew Huberman: So when we see\ntech founders getting called upto Congress for what looks like\ninterrogation, but it's probablypretty light interrogation compared\nto what happens in other countries.Marc Andreessen: Yeah, it's state power.They just have this view of top down\nstate power, and they view it's thattheir system, and they view that\nit's necessary for lots of historicaland moral reasons that they've\ndefined, and that's how they run.And then they've got a view that\nsays how they want to propagatethat vision outside the country.And they have these programs like Belt\nand Road that basically are intended topropagate kind of their vision worldwide.And so they are who they are.I will say that they don't lie about it.They're very straightforward.They give speeches, they write books.You can buy Xi Jinping speeches.He goes through the whole thing.They have their tech 2025 plan.This is like ten years ago.Their whole AI agenda, it's all in there.Andrew Huberman: And is their goal that\nin 200 years, 300 years, that China isthe superpower controlling everything?Marc Andreessen: Yeah.Or 20 years, 30 years, or\ntwo years, three years.Andrew Huberman: Yeah, but\nthey've got a shorter horizon.Marc Andreessen: I don't know.Everybody's a little bit like this,\nI guess, but, yeah, they want to win.Andrew Huberman: Well, the CRISPR in\nhumans example that I gave earlierwas interesting to me because, first\nof all, I'm a neuroscientist andthey could have edited any genes,\nbut they chose to edit the genesinvolved in the attempt to create\nsuper memory babies, which presumablywould grow into super memory adults.And whether or not they\nsucceeded in that isn't clear.Those babies are alive and\npresumably by now, walking, talking.As far as I know, whether or not\nthey have super memories isn't clear.But China is clearly unafraid\nto augment biology in that way.And I believe that that's inevitable,\nthat's going to happen elsewhere, probablyfirst for the treatment of disease.But at some point, I'm assuming people\nare going to augment biology to makesmarter kids, not always, but often will\nselect mates based on the traits theywould like their children to inherit.So this happens far more frequently\nthan could be deemed bad.Either that or people are bad,\nbecause people do this all the time,selecting mates that have physical and\npsychological and cognitive traits thatyou would like your offspring to have.CRISPR is a more targeted approach.Of course, the reason I'm kind of\ngiving this example and examples"

            "text": "like it is that I feel like so much\nof the way that governments andthe public react to technologies\nis to just take that first glimpse.And it just feels scary.You think about the old\nApple ad of the 1984 Ad.I mean, there was one very scary\nversion of the personal computerand computers and robots taking\nover and everyone like automatons.And then there was the Apple version\nwhere it's all about creativity,love and peace, and it had the pseudo\npsychedelic California thing going for it.Again, great marketing seems to convert\npeople's thinking about technologysuch that what was once viewed as\nvery scary and dangerous and dystopianis like an oasis of opportunity.So why are people so\nafraid of new technologies?Marc Andreessen: So this is the\nthing I've tried to understand for along time, because the history is so\nclear and the history basically isthat every new technology is greeted\nby what's called a moral panic.And so it's basically this hysterical\nfreak out of some kind that causes peopleto basically predict the end of the world.And you go back in time, and actually,\nthis is a historical sort of effect,it happens even in things now where\nyou just look back and it's ludicrous.And so you mentioned earlier\nthe satanic panic of the concernaround, like, heavy metal music.Before that, there was, like,\na freak out around comic books.In the 50s, there was a freak\nout around jazz music in the20s and 30s, it's devil music.There was a freak out, the arrival\nof bicycles caused a moral panicin the, like, 1860s, 1870s.Bicycles?Bicycles, yeah.So there was this thing at the time.So bicycles were the first.They were the first very easy to use\npersonal transportation thing thatbasically let kids travel between\ntowns quickly without any overhead.You have to take care of a horse.You just jump on a bike and go.And so there was a historical panic,\nspecifically around at the time,young women who for the first time,\nwere able to venture outside theconfines of the town to maybe go\nhave a boyfriend, another town.And so the magazines at the time read\nall these stories on this phenomenon,medical phenomenon, called bicycle face.And the idea of bicycle face was\nthe exertion caused by pedalinga bicycle would cause your face.Your face would grimace, and then\nif you were on the bicycle for toolong, your face would lock into place.Andrew Huberman: [LAUGHS] Sorry.Marc Andreessen: And then you would\nbe unattractive, and therefore, ofcourse, unable to then get married.Cars, there was a moral\npanic around red flag laws.There are all these laws\nthat created the automobile.Automobiles freaked people out.So there are all these laws in the\nearly days of the automobile, in alot of places, you would take a ride\nin an automobile and automobiles,they broke down all the time.So only rich people had automobiles.It'd be you and your mechanic in the car.Right, for when it broke down.And then you had to hire another guy to\nwalk 200 yards in front of the car with ared flag, and he had to wave the red flag.And so you could only drive as fast as\nhe could walk because the red flag wasto warn people that the car was coming.I think it was Pennsylvania.They had the most draconian version,\nwhich was they were very worriedabout the car scaring the horses.And so there was a law that\nsaid if you saw a horse coming,you needed to stop the car.You had to disassemble the car, and\nyou had to hide the pieces of thecar behind the nearest hay bale, wait\nfor the horse to go by, and then youcould put your car back together.Anyways, an example is electric lighting.There was a panic around, like, whether\nthis is going to become complete ruin.This is going to completely\nruin the romance of the dark.And it was going to cause a whole new\nkind of terrible civilization whereeverything is always brightly lit.So there's just all these examples.And so it's like, okay,\nwhat on earth is happening?That this is always what happens?And so I finally found this book\nthat I think has a good model for it.A book is called Men, Machines, and\nModern Times . And it's written bythis MIT professor, like, 60 years ago.So it predates the Internet, but it\nuses a lot of historical examples.And what he says, basically, is, he says\nthere's actually a three stage response.There's a three stage societal\nresponse to new technologies.It's very predictable.He said, stage one is\nbasically just denial.Just ignore.Like, we just don't pay attention to this.Nobody takes it seriously.There's just a blackout\non the whole topic.He says, that's stage one.Stage two is rational counterargument.So stage two is where you line\nup all the different reasonswhy this can't possibly work.It can't possibly ever get cheap,\nor this, that it's not fastenough, or whatever the thing is.And then he says, stage three, he\nsays, is when the name calling begins.So he says, stage three is like when\nthey fail to ignore it and they'vefailed to argue society out of it.Andrew Huberman: I love it.Marc Andreessen: They\nmove to the name calling.And what's the name calling?The name calling is, this is evil.This is moral panic.This is evil.This is terrible.This is awful.This is going to destroy everything.Don't you understand?All this is horrifying.And you, the person working on it,\nare being reckless and evil and allthis stuff, and you must be stopped.And he said the reason for\nthat is because, basically,fundamentally, what these things\nare is they're a war over status.It's a war over status, and\ntherefore a war over power.And then, of course, ultimately money.But human status is the thing,\nbecause what he says is, what is thesocietal impact of a new technology?The societal impact of a new technology\nis it reorders status in the society.So the people who are specialists in that\ntechnology become high status, and thepeople who are specialists in the previous\nway of doing things become low status.And generally, people don't adapt.Generally, if you're the kind of\nperson who is high status becauseyou're an evolved adaptation to an\nexisting technology, you're probablynot the kind of person that's going\nto enthusiastically try to replantyourself onto a new technology.This is like every politician\nwho's just like in a completestate of panic about social media.Like, why are they so freaked\nout about social media?Is, because they all know that the whole\nnature of modern politics has changed.The entire battery of techniques\nthat you use to get elected beforesocial media are now obsolete.Obviously, the best new politicians\nof the future are going to be100% creations of social media.Andrew Huberman: And podcasts.Marc Andreessen: And podcasts.Andrew Huberman: And we're seeing\nthis now as we head towardsthe next presidential election.That podcasts clearly are going to\nbe featured very heavily in that nextelection, because long form content\nis a whole different landscape.Marc Andreessen: Rogan's had, like, what?He's had, like Bernie, he's had like\nTulsi, he's had like a whole series.Andrew Huberman: Of RFK most recently.And that's created a lot of controversy.Marc Andreessen: A lot of controversy.But also my understanding, I'm\nsure he's invited everybody.I'm sure he'd love to have Biden on.I'm sure he'd love to have Trump on.Andrew Huberman: I'm sure\nhe'd have to ask him.I mean, I think every podcaster\nhas their own ethos around whothey invite on and why and how.So I certainly can't speak for\nhim, but I have to imagine that anyopportunity to have true, long form\ndiscourse that would allow people toreally understand people's positions\non things, I have to imagine that hewould be in favor of that sort of thing.Marc Andreessen: Yeah.\nOr somebody else would, right?Some other top podcaster would.Exactly.I totally agree with you.But my point is, if you're a\npolitician, if you're a legacypolitician, you have the option\nof embracing the new technology.You can do it anytime you want.Right.But you don't.They're not, they won't.They won't do it.And why won't they do it?Well, okay, first of all,\nthey want to ignore it.They want to pretend that\nthings aren't changing.Second is they want to have rational\ncounterarguments for why theexisting campaign system works the\nway that it does, and this and thatand the existing media networks.And here's how you do things, and here's\nhow you give speeches, and here's theclothes you wear and the tie and the thing\nand the pocket square, and you've, that.It's how you succeeded was\ncoming up through that system.So you've got all your arguments\nas to why that won't work anymore.And then we've now proceeded\nto the name calling phase,which is now it's evil, right?Now it's evil for somebody to show\nup on a stream, God forbid, for threehours and actually say what they think.It's going to destroy society, right?So it's exactly like, it's a\nclassic example of this pattern.Anyway, so Morrison says in the book,\nbasically, this is the forever pattern.This will never change.This is one of those things where you\ncan learn about it and still nothing,the entire world could learn about\nthis, and still nothing changes.Because at the end of the day, it's\nnot the tech that's the question,it's the reordering of status.Andrew Huberman: I have a lot of\nthoughts about the podcast component.I'll just say this because I\nwant to get back to the topicof innovation of technology.But on a long form podcast,\nthere's no safe zone.The person can get up and walk out.But if the person interviewing them, and\ncertainly Joe is the best of the verybest, if not the most skilled podcaster\nin the entire universe at continuingto press people on specific topics when\nthey're trying to bob and weave andwriggle out, he'll just keep either\ndrilling or alter the question somewhatin a way that forces them to finally\ncome up with an answer of some sort.And I think that probably puts\ncertain people's cortisol levelsthrough the roof, such that they\njust would never go on there.Marc Andreessen: I think there's another\ndeeper question also, or another questionalong with that, which is how many\npeople actually have something to say.Andrew Huberman: Real substance.Marc Andreessen: Right.Like how many people can actually talk\nin a way that's actually interestingto anybody else for any length of time.How much substance is there, really?And a lot of historical politics was to\nbe able to manufacture a facade where youhonestly, as far as you can't tell how\ndeep the thoughts are, even if they havedeep thoughts, it's kept away from you.They would certainly never cop to it.Andrew Huberman: It's going to\nbe an interesting next, whatis it, about 20 months or so.Marc Andreessen: So panic and the\nname calling have already started?Andrew Huberman: Yeah, I was going to\nsay this list of three things, denial,the counterargument, and name calling.It seems like with AI, it's already\njust jumped to numbers two and three.Marc Andreessen: Yes, correct.Andrew Huberman: We're already at two and\nthree, and it's kind of leaning three.Marc Andreessen: That's correct.AI is unusual just because new\ntechnologies that take off, theyalmost always have a prehistory.They almost always have a 30 or 40 year\nhistory where people tried and failed toget them to work before they took off.AI has an 80 year prehistory,\nso it has a very long one.And then it all of a sudden\nstarted to work dramaticallywell, seemingly overnight.And so it went from basically as\nfar as most people were concerned,it went from it doesn't work at all\nto it works incredibly well in onestep, and that almost never happens.I actually think that's\nexactly what's happening.I think it's actually speed running\nthis progression just because if youuse Midjourney or you use GPT or any of\nthese things for five minutes, you'rejust like, wow, obviously this thing is\ngoing to be like, obviously in my life,this is going to be the best thing ever.This is amazing.There's all these ways that I can use it.And then therefore, immediately\nyou're like, oh my God, this isgoing to transform everything.Therefore, step three,\nstraight to the name calling.Andrew Huberman: In the face of all this."

            "text": "There are innovators out there.Maybe they are aware they are innovators.Maybe they are already starting\ncompanies, or maybe they are just someyoung or older person who has these\nfive traits in abundance or doesn't,but knows somebody who does and is\npartnering with them in some sort of idea.And you have an amazing track\nrecord at identifying these people.I think in part because you\nhave those same traits yourself.I've heard you say the following:\nthe world is a very malleable place.If you know what you want and you go\nfor it with maximum energy and driveand passion, the world will often\nreconfigure itself around you much morequickly and easily than you would think.That's a remarkable quote because\nit says at least two things to me.One is that you have a very\nclear understanding of the innerworkings of these great innovators.We talked a little bit about that\nearlier, these five traits, etc.,but that also you have an intense\nunderstanding of the world landscape.And the way that we've been talking\na bout it for the last hour orso is that it is a really intense\nand kind of oppressive landscape.You've got countries and organizations\nand elites and journalists that aretrying to, not necessarily trying, but\nare suppressing the innovation process.I mean, that's sort of the\npicture that I'm getting.So it's like we're trying to\ninnovate inside of a vise that'sgetting progressively tighter.And yet this quote argues that it is\nthe person, the boy or girl, man orwoman, who says, well, you know what?That all might be true, but my view\nof the world is the way the world'sgoing to bend, or I'm going to create\na dent in that vise that allowsme to exist the way that I want.Or you know what, I'm actually going to\nuncurl the vise in the other direction.And so I'm at once picking up a sort of\npessimistic, glass half empty view of theworld, as well as a glass half full view.So tell me about that.Could you tell us about that from the\nperspective of someone listening who isthinking, I've got an idea, and I know\nit's a really good one, because I justknow I might not have the confidence\nof extrinsic reward yet, but I justknow there's a seed of something.What does it take to foster that?And how do we foster real innovation in\nthe landscape that we're talking about?Marc Andreessen: Yeah, so part is, I\nthink, one of the ways to square it is,I think you as the innovator need to\nbe signed up to fight the fight, right?And again, this is where the fictional\nportrayals of startups, I think, takepeople off course, or even scientists\nor whatever, because when there'sgreat success stories, they get kind\nof prettified after the fact andthey get made to be cute and fun,\nand it's like, yeah, no, if you talkto anybody who actually did any of\nthese, like, these things are alwaysjust like brutal exercises and just\nlike sheer willpower and fightingforces that are trying to get you.So part of it is you have to\nbe signed up for the fight.And this kind of goes\nto the conscientiousnessthing we're talking also.My partner, Ben, uses the term courage\na lot, which is some combination ofjust stubbornness, but coupled with a\nwillingness to take pain and not stopand have people think very bad things of\nyou for a long time until it turns outyou hopefully prove yourself correct.And so you have to be willing to do that.It's a contact sport.These aren't easy roads, right?It's a contact sport, so you have\nto be signed up for the fight.The advantage that you have as an\ninnovator is that at the end of theday, the truth actually matters.And all the arguments in the world, the\nclassic Victor Hugo quote is, \"There'snothing more powerful in the world\nthan an idea whose time has come.\"If it's real, right?And this is just pure substance, if\nthe thing is real, if the idea isreal, if it's a legitimately good\nscientific discovery about how thenature works, if it's a new invention,\nif it's a new work of art, and ifit's real, then you do, at the end of\nthe day, you have that on your side.And all of the people who are fighting\nyou and arguing with you and telling youno, they don't have that on their side.It's not that they're showing up with\nsome other thing and they're like,my thing is better than your thing.That's not the main problem.The main problem is I have a thing.I'm convinced everybody else is telling\nme it's stupid, wrong, it shouldbe illegal, whatever the thing is.But at the end of the day, I\nstill have the thing, right?So at the end of the day,\nthe truth really matters.The substance really matters if it's real.I'll give you an example.It's really hard historically to find\nan example of a new technology that cameinto the world that was then pulled back.Nuclear is maybe an example of that.But even still, there are still\nnuclear plants, like, running today.That still exists.I would say the same thing as\nscientific, at least I may ask you this.I don't know of any scientific\ndiscovery that was made, and thenpeople like, I know there are areas\nof science that are not politicallycorrect to talk about today, but\nevery scientist knows the truth.The truth is still the truth.I mean, even the geneticists in the Soviet\nUnion who were forced to buy in, like,knew the whole time that it was wrong.That I'm completely convinced of.Andrew Huberman: Yeah, they couldn't\ndelude themselves, especially becausethe basic training that one gets in any\nfield establishes some core truths uponwhich even the crazy ideas have to rest.And if they don't, as you pointed\nout, things fall to pieces.I would say that even the technologies\nthat did not pan out and in some caseswere disastrous, but that were great ideas\nat the beginning, are starting to pan out.So the example I'll give is that most\npeople are aware of the Elizabeth HolmesTheranos debacle, to put it lightly,\nanalyzing what's in a single drop ofblood as a way to analyze hormones\nand disease and antibodies, etc.I mean, that's a great\nidea, it's a terrific idea.As opposed to having a phlebotomist\ncome to your house or you have togo in and you get tapped and then\npulling vials and the whole thing.There's now a company born out of\nStanford that is doing exactly what shesought to do, except that at least the\ncourts ruled that she fudged the thing,and that's why she's in jail right now.But the idea of getting a wide array\nof markers from a single drop of bloodis an absolutely spectacular idea.The biggest challenge that company\nhas is going to confront is the ideathat it's just the next Theranos.But if they've got the thing and t\nhey're not fudging it, as apparentlyTheranos was, I think everything\nwill work out ala Victor Hugo.Marc Andreessen: Yeah, exactly.Because who wants to go back if\nthey get to the work, if it's real?This is the thing.The opponents, they're not\nbringing their own ideas.They're not bringing their, oh,\nmy idea is better than yours.That's not what's happening.They're bringing the silence or\ncounterargument or name calling.Andrew Huberman: Well, this is why I\nthink people who need to be loved probablystand a reduced chance of success.And maybe that's also why having\npeople close to you that dolove you and allowing that to be\nsufficient can be very beneficial.This gets back to the idea of partnership\nand family around innovators, becauseif you feel filled up by those people\nlocal to you in your home, then you don'tneed people on the Internet saying nice\nthings about you or your ideas, becauseyou're good and you can forge forward.Another question about innovation is\nthe teams that you assemble around you,"

            "text": "and you've talked before about the sort\nof small squadron model, sort of Davidand Goliath examples as well, where a\nsmall group of individuals can create atechnology that frankly outdoes what a\ngiant like Facebook might be doing or whatany other large company might be doing.There are a lot of theories as to\nwhy that would happen, but I knowyou have some unique theories.Why do you think small groups\ncan defeat large organizations?Marc Andreessen: So the conventional\nexplanation is, I think, correct, andit's just that large organizations have\na lot of advantages, but they just havea very hard time actually executing\nanything because of all the overhead.So large organizations have\ncombinatorial communication overhead.The number of people who have to\nbe consulted, who have to agreeon things, gets to be staggering.The amount of time it takes to schedule\nthe meeting gets to be staggering.You get these really big companies and\nthey have some issue they're dealingwith, and it takes like a month to\nschedule the pre meeting, to plan forthe meeting, which is going to happen\ntwo months later, which is then going toresult in a post meeting, which will then\nresult in a board presentation, whichwill then result in a planning off site.Andrew Huberman: I\nthought academia was bad.But what you're describing\nis giving me hives.Marc Andreessen: Kafka was a documentary.Yeah.Look, you'd have these organizations\nat 100,000 people are more like you'remore of a nation state than a company.And you've got all these competing\ninternal, it's the Bedouinthing I was saying before.You've got all these internal, at\nmost big companies, your internalenemies are way more dangerous to\nyou than anybody on the outside.Andrew Huberman: Can\nyou elaborate on that?Marc Andreessen: Oh, yeah.At a big company, the big competition\nis for the next promotion, right?And the enemy for the next promotion is\nthe next executive over in your company.That's your enemy.The competitor on the outside\nis like an abstraction.Like, maybe they'll\nmatter someday, whatever.I've got to beat that guy\ninside my own company.Right?And so the internal warfare is at least\nas intense as the external warfare.This is just all the iron law of all these\nbig bureaucracies and how they function.So if a big bureaucracy ever does anything\nproductive, I think it's like a miracle.It's like a miracle to the point where\nthere should be like a celebration,there should be parties, there should be\nlike ticker tape parades for big, largeorganizations that actually do things.That's great because it's so rare.It doesn't happen very often anyway.So that's the conventional explanation,\nwhereas, look, small companies, smallteams, there's a lot that they can't\ndo because they're not operatingat scale and they don't have global\ncoverage and all these kind of, theydon't have the resources and so forth.But at least they can move quickly, right?They can organize fast.If there's an issue today,\nthey can have a meeting today,they can solve the issue today.And everybody they need to solve\nthe issue is in the room today.So they can just move a lot faster.I think that's part of it.But I think there's another deeper\nthing underneath that, that peoplereally don't like to talk about.That takes us back full circle to\nwhere we started, which is just thesheer number of people in the world\nwho are capable of doing new thingsis just a very small set of people.And so you're not going to have 100 of\nthem in a company or 1000 or 10,000.You're going to have\nthree, eight or ten, maybe.Andrew Huberman: And some of them\nare flying too close to the sun.Marc Andreessen: Some of them\nare blowing themselves up, right?Some of them are.So IBM.I actually first learned this at IBM.My first actual job job was at IBM\nwhen IBM was still on top of the worldright before it caved in the early 90s.And so when I was there it was 440,000\nemployees which, and again if youinflation adjust like today for that\nsame size of business, inflationadjusted, market size adjusted, it would\nbe its equivalent today of like a twoor three million person organization.It was a nation state.There were 6000 people in my\ndivision and we were next door toanother building that had another\n6000 people in another division.So you could work there for\nyears and never meet anybodywho didn't work for IBM.The first half of every meeting\nwas just IBMers introducingthemselves to each other.It was just mind boggling,\nthe level of complexity.But they were so powerful that they had\nfour years before I got there in 1985,they were 80% of the market capitalization\nof the entire tech industry.So they were at a level of dominance\nthat even Google or Apple todayis not even close to at the time.So that's how powerful they were.And so they had a system and it\nworked really well for like 50 years.They had a system which was.Most of the employees in the company\nwere expected to basically follow rules.So they dressed the same,\nthey acted the same, they dideverything out of the playbook.They were trained very specifically\nbut they had this category ofpeople they called Wild Ducks.And this was an idea that\nthe founder Thomas Watsonhad come up with, Wild Ducks.And the Wild ducks were, they often had\nthe formal title of an IBM fellow andthey were the people who could make new\nthings and there were eight of them.And they got to break all the rules\nand they got to invent new products.They got to go off and\nwork on something new.They didn't have to report back.They got to pull people off of\nother projects to work with them.They got budget when they needed it.They reported directly to the CEO,\nthey got whatever they needed.He supported them in doing it.And they were glass breakers.And the one in Austin at the\ntime was this guy Andy Heller.And he would show up in jeans and cowboy\nboots and amongst an ocean of men inblue suits, white shirts, red ties and\nput his cowboy boots up on the table andit was fine for Andy Heller to do that.And it was not fine for\nyou to do that, right.And so they very specifically\nidentified, we have almost like anaristocratic class within our company\nthat gets to play by different rules.Now the expectation is\nthey deliver, right?Their job is to invent the\nnext breakthrough product.But we, IBM management, know that\nthe 6000 person division is notgoing to invent the next product.We know it's going to be crazy.Andy Heller in his cowboy boots.And so I was always very impressed.Again, ultimately, IBM had its issues,\nbut that model worked for 50 years.Right?\nLike, worked incredibly well.And I think that's basically\nthe model that works.But it's a paradox, right?Which is like, how do you have a large,\nbureaucratic, regimented organization,whether it's academia or government\nor business or anything, that has allthese rule followers in it and all these\npeople who are jealous of their statusand don't want things to change, but\nthen still have that spark of creativity?I would say mostly it's impossible.Mostly it just doesn't happen.Those people get driven out.And in tech, what happens is those people\nget driven out because we will fund them.These are the people we fund.Andrew Huberman: I was going to say,\nrather, that you are in the businessof finding and funding the wild ducks.Marc Andreessen: The wild ducks.That's exactly right.And actually, this is\nactually, close the loop.This is actually, I think, the\nsimplest explanation for why IBMultimately caved in, and then HP\nsort of in the 80s also caved in.IBM and HP kind of were these\nincredible, monolithic, incrediblecompanies for 40 or 50 years, and\nthen they kind of both caved in.In the actually, think it was the\nemergence of venture capital, it wasthe emergence of a parallel funding\nsystem where the wild ducks, or inHP's case, their superstar technical\npeople, could actually leave and starttheir own companies is, and again, it\ngoes back to the university discussionwe're having is like, this is what\ndoesn't exist at the university level.This certainly does not exist\nat the government level.Andrew Huberman: And until recently in\nmedia, it didn't exist until there'sthis thing that we call podcasts.Marc Andreessen: Exactly right.Andrew Huberman: Which clearly\nhave picked up some momentum, andI would hope that these other wild\nduck models will move quickly.Marc Andreessen: Yeah, but the one\nthing you know, and you know this, theone thing you know is the people on the\nother side are going to be mad as hell.Andrew Huberman: Yeah, they're going\nto, well, I think they're past denial.The counterarguments continue.The name calling is prolific.Marc Andreessen: Name\ncalling is fully underway.Andrew Huberman: Well, Marc, we've covered\na lot of topics, but as with every timeI talk to you, I learn oh, so very much.I'm so grateful for you taking the\ntime out of your schedule to talk aboutall of these topics in depth with us.I'd be remiss if I didn't say that.It is clear to me now that you are hyper\nrealistic about the landscape, but youare also intensely optimistic about\nthe existence of wild ducks and thosearound them that support them and that\nare necessary for the implementationof their ideas at some point.And that also, you have\na real rebel inside you.So that is oh, so welcome on this podcast.And it's also needed in\nthese times and every time.So on behalf of myself and the rest of\nus here at the podcast, and especiallythe listeners, thank you so much.Marc Andreessen: Thanks for having me.Andrew Huberman: Thank you\nfor joining me for today's"
