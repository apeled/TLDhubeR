            "text": "in the parks on transition as we say orwere you pushing around in the drivewaylike most kids it was I wastransportationand skating was kind of a fad so Istarted in 78 roughly maybe 77 even andit was kind of a fad sokids just had skateboards and they wouldthey would all cruise around you knowlike it was the 70s so everyone had abike right and you knew wherever all thekids were because the bikes were in thefront lawn and then at some point thatkind of turned into skatingso everyone had skateboards they're alllikeshittyyou know uh JCPenney or Big Box storeskateboards no one had really good onesnot in my areaum but then at some point we were justlooking at these magazines of peopleskating and everyone's skating in poolsbecause that was the Dogtown and Z-Boysera and it was like these guys areflying I wanna like where do we do thatand then the skate park opened up in SanDiego that was Del Mar's Cooper uh okayOasis Oasis skatepark was the first onein our area actually I take that backSpring Valley was the first skate park Itried to go there and I was nine and youhad to be 10.and I remember like sitting in theparking lot looking over the fence andmy dad didn't realize what they atebecause my dad would have easily liedfor me but he didn't realize there wasan age limit and he said how old is henine oh sorry he can't comeand then they closednot long after so when I never got toSpring Valleyum because I I think of you assynonymous with Del Mar skate Ranch surewell that was that came later becauseOasis skate park was opened up so thiswas when I first went was like 78.uh a friend of mine was going and hesaid I want to go to the skate park so Ihad to go getyou know this is such a hassle like Ihad to go get the authorization form Ihad to get it notarized by the bank formy parents like to go there and then Iwent and it was that was my Epiphanywhen I first saw people flying around inperson I was like this is what I'm doingfor as long as I could possibly do itbecause it looked it looked like magicit really did it looked like they wereflying on magic carpets and and it spoketo me in the sense of being a daredevilbut alsodoing it individually not relying on myteam notum gettinghassled by a coach it was just like oh Ican be part of the scene but do it myown way and then uhI skated Oasis as much as I couldwhenever I get your rides there andum then my parents moved to North CountySan Diego when I was in high schoolum mostly because they were just chasingkind of real estate deals and uh and soI got lucky that Dome our skate Ranchwas right thereevery other Park closed but Del Marskate Ranch remained open so I meanthere was a bit of luck to all that andit was based on geographyyour dad's involvement is interestingbecauseI got into skateboarding because youknow my dad wasn't around that much atthat time a lot of kids gettingskateboarding because it doesn't requireparent involvement was it unusual tohave parental involvement at that stageyeah I mean I remember Frank and by theway I remember Frank and Nancy yourparents with was with such fondness notjust because they took me in but Iremember thinking like there they wereat times the only point of stability ina landscape of like 200 people where asyou know there could be potential chaosof any kind and your dad had this way ofmoving about like he wasn't afraid Irecall that he wasn't afraid to say whathe thought like hey don't do that likeimpose some regulation at this contestand at the same time it seemed me alsounderstood that this was a sport unlikeother sports like you're not gonnaregulatekids like me at the time or you're notgoing to try and control people so whatwas it like to have your dad involvedand the reason I ask is that you're aparent we'll talk more about parentingbut also it seems that he went fromsaying okay you know little league othersports which is more typical to okaythis kind of unusual sport skateboardingbut your mere interest in it was enoughto get him excited or motivated enoughto take you around to these placesum that's pretty special I mean that'spretty it was I mean and in that respectit was great to have his support and andto rely on him for that the fact that hewas always around and he was in chargeof a lot of the events that that suckedbecausebecause it just marked meum as one being favoritedum and spoiledum and and most of my friends theirparents didn't want them skating so eventhough they were stoked that my dad hadwas was doing this kind of thing andgiving that kind of support they stillwere like your Dad's here like this isour thing this is our scene this is ourgetaway from our parentswell I I didn't really have a choice inthe matter I did I did at some pointtell him my my concerns and myfrustrations with it but he didn'treally want to hear it you know he washe was very much steadfast like well I'mI'm been coming this far like you can wecan keep our distance at these eventsbut people are relying on me to organizethem and so I just had to suck it up fora while did it push you harder like youknow if you could prove yourself with askateboarding that you didn't have toworry about any claims of favoritismbecause ultimately you can't fake youcan't fake Escape right right I meanthere's no deep fake version ofskateboarding you know you either can doit or you can't do it and it's shown inreal timesoumand I suppose back then I recall you"

            "text": "were quite a bitskinny or skinnier oh yeah I had I hadall kinds of things going against me atthe time yeah I mean I don't thinkpeople will realize this unless they'vemet you in person but nowadays there area few taller skateboarders out therebecause the Sports grown so muchum but you're pretty tall you're likesix six three but okay I was not when Iwas growing when I was that age I wasvery smallum and kind ofconcerningly small Because by the time Igot to be 16I was still I looked like I was 13. Iused to get pulled overI literally like I had a car that Ibought with my earnings I had a HondaCivic 1977 cvcc and I would get pulledover and then the cops would be like howold are you again 16. like well you looklike you were 13 back thereum and then I shot up around age 17.okay so that's interesting and we canget back to this when we talk about youralmost remarkable levels of ability torecover from physical injuries becauseum well I'll just share a little bit ofa biological Theory here which is thatyou know there are a lot of people thatstudy longevity and perhaps the fastestrate of Aging that we ever undergo ispuberty right if you think about a kidbefore puberty kid after abuse differenthuman being psychologically oftenphysically as well some people have alonger Arc of puberty than others andthat does seem to correlate with alonger lifeand so it's kind of interesting you knowsome kids hit puberty and they gothrough all the markers of puberty inlike one summer right other kids it'svery very long and it sounds like wedon't have to talk about when you hitpuberty and the other markers but itsounds like your growth spurt occurredlate oh yeah that's a terrific marker ofa long life by the way because what itreflects is the onset of a big burst ofgrowth hormone out of the pituitary inthe brain andif you continue to grow for a longperiod of time that indicates you knowit gives you a little bit of the slopeof the line does that make sense oh yeahso um this this may um have importantand fortunate consequences so at 17 youshot up am I correct in Remembering uhmaybe you said it maybe somebody elsedid that you wereum forgive me but so skinny when youwere a kid that you actually wore elbowpads as knee pads yeah yeah that's atrue that's a true story for sure andandI took inspiration from others that thatI identified with namely Steve Caballerobecause he was already an establishedPro when I started to come up in theranks or even get noticed at all and hewas wearing elbow pads on his knees inthis full-page picture of him andWinchester doing a back sitter and I waslike that I want to do that and he'ssmalland I feel like that's my goal yeah likeif he can do that I can do it it wasjust more like oh this I identify withthat and and that gives me hopeum and as I recall Stevie also has apretty severe scoliosis right like atone point Julius what he has at onepoint he was turned turned pretty prettytight to the to the right or left Idon't recall which I mean stillincredible skateboarder loves TV he's aNorCal guy so yeah I grew up I knowwhatever he had is from birth but um butit was more that his size and I didn'teven know he was he many not many butyou know he's like four years older thanmeum so I just was like oh there's smallguys doing that I can do it maybe butwhen I got tall when I went throughpuberty suddenly I had all these tricksand then suddenly I had the strength andthe the height that gave me confidenceand so all of a sudden it was like oh Ican go way higher nowand I'm comfortable with these tricksthese intricate board Maneuvers andstuff so that was a huge advantage to meum the the smaller Stuff felt differentafter that which was harderum but being able to blast AFI in theair as opposed to four feet in the airwas a huge Advantage yeah isn't thatwild when the nervous system knows howto do something and then your bodychanges and you can do the same thingbut with so much more Force even thebowls look smallerwhen I would stand on top I was likewait this isn't that bigit's wild well the reason I ask aboutthis I think you know people listeninggenerally seem to assume that you knowif you become a Stanford Professor orbecome a professional skateboarder oryou a professional soccer player thatthat you were just fated to become thatright and it's clear that it's theConfluence of so many different factorsum but one of the consistent factors forsure is a sense that you just reallylove doing it right I mean I can'timagine gettingyou know proficient or excellent atanything without loving doing it rightand so still at this time when you werelet's say um 14 15um did you have any concept of you knowwhatever pro model I'm gonna none ofthat well there was there was none ofthat to be hadso we didn't have these greataspirations because no one had reallydone that before there were you couldhave some success yes you could havemaybe a signature model but even the topsales of skateboarding then wasn't acareerthe prize money was 150 for first place100 for second 50 for thirdcouple tanks of gas some food yeah solet's put it this wayI turned Pro when I was 14. by the timeI was15 and a half and I had a learner'spermit and I could drive a scooter youknow I had 600 in my bank account and Iused that to buy a Honda Express uhmoped for a year and a half that was myearningswas six hundred dollars so clearly moneywasn't the uh the dopamine hit it wasthe it was the actual skateboard sureand that's what I mean though therewasn't there was no goal of that becauseit just didn't exist so I didn't carelike getting I I have my own vehicleat age 15 like I was living largeI can get to the skate park on my ownthat was amazingto be 14and be a professional at anything must"

            "text": "beum a trip so to speakum but what I'm wondering about becauseI came up whenum your early cohort with Paul Peraltaso for those that don't know so-calledBones Brigade rightI guess it was a total what like sixseven guys there were someone that werea little more peripheral than othersum they're about six seven core guysum in the various videos I mean you guyswere famous right you had postersum on kids walls who skateboarded therewas a second or maybe it was a thirdsurge of popularity and skateboardingum because it would sort of surge ingeneral popularity than disappear andcome back as it has over decades itkeeps coming and goingum to some extentdid you have a conscious awareness ofjust how you know how much attention wasbeing placed on you know photos of youvideos of you and I'm just wonderingabout the younger version of you whetheror not you know you realize what washappening and the reason I ask isbecause you've always seemed to mesomebody who through interviews throughvideos through our interactions and forthose who have known you much longerthan I haveum just very grounded like not caught upin itum you know we've never seen headlinesabout you kind of just you know blowingall your money or you know wrecking carsand you know destroying your life I meanI'm sure you've made mistakes like anyof us but but you seem to have avoided alot of the pitfalls of quote unquotefamous people and celebrities and yetyou were a famous person from a veryyoung ageIwell I think it was that I didn't neverI neverthat was never a goal and then when Ihad a sense of it I was veryuncomfortableI mean I was happy I was happy to besuccessful I was happy that peoplerecognized me that that was amazing justbecause I was good at skateboarding Inever imagined something like thatum and but I was always veryI mean some people thought that I wassort of almost like pompous or arrogantbecause I wasn't interacting because Iwas just I was walled up I was like Idon't know what to do I don't know thisis the last words I would ever use todescribe you I think it was just morethat that that people would see me likeI go to a ramp I didn't know anybody andI would just start skating and I'd doall my stuff and they were like oh hedoesn't even talk to anyoneand I was like I don't know I don't knowwhat to do I don't know how to act alsoyou were 14 years old so Stacy broke meout of that because I remember one timethere was a kid that was just staring atme like hold my skateboard he had mysignature model and he said go say hi tothat guywhat are you sure like he wants he wantsto interact with you you know just gohigh five of them or anything and and Ilearned to sort of break out of mycomfort zone by doing that enoughum but my first go around I mean thatwas that was sort of my firstuh wave of Fame I'd say the BonesBrigade yearsand we are so young that we thought thisis foreverand so we were definitely careless withour our money with our actions andum and at some point my dad saw that hedidn't think it was going to be longtermbecause no one had had a long-termcareer right so he he uh encouraged meto to invest to get property like to buya housethat was the that was my Saving Gracebecause I definitely wasspending on cars and things like that uhyeah car like kind of a little bitbeyond my means I wasn't reallyconsidering all my money was was 10.99income so it wasn't we weren't payingtaxes on anything and at the end of theyear it would be like oh you owe thismuch like wait what are you talkingabout soum for instancehey do you want to go to Hawaii yeahokay invite everyonewe're all going to HawaiiI got well let's rent a place okay youknow and it was on me because I had themeans you mentioned Stacy we shouldprobably clarify for peopleum Tony's referring to the great StacyPeralta yeah he was he was the one whoput me on the Bones Brigade when I wasstill considered sort of a circus actlike a you know my my skating was notreally establishedthe stuff that I was doing was largelymade fun of because people thought thatwhat I was doing was just more like afree showcan you explain more so my and let mejust tell you that my recollection firstrecollection of you that I still havethat image in my mind would um is thefinger flip error right you know so forfolks that aren't familiar withskateboarding you know people ridearound on transition or in the streethandrails stairs you know peopleprobably familiar with all those thingsbut um skateboards will Riot up towardthe top of the pool of the ramp andthey'll do something on the so-calledlip or the coping that's to ride at thethe edge of it or they'll go above itlike in the air but I recall seeing youdo the finger flip error I've never seenanyone flip a board in the air I've seenpeople do varial so right move it it'sgoing to be complicated for people justlistening but just flip it upside downand then catch it in and finger fliperror yeah that was I remember that wasa jaw drop right it was like so if thatwas considered circus era or circus uhlike then I don't know I don't know whatit was being compared to because at thetime we we probably watched that it wasin slow motion as I recall and weprobably watched itthree thousand times you know thatsummer there's a big group of us thatall starts skateboarding that summerum I would say kind of just before thatin that window is when people werewere moreumgiving me Flack for what I was doingbecause I was mostly doing boardvariation stuff but I still didn't havethe height the height in terms of theheight in terms of in terms of gettingin the air yeah so I was doing all thisstuff kind of right at coping level andso people weren't taking it intoconsideration or giving it much Meritbecause it was just like oh he's doing alittle board twist or a bar turn andthen when I started to get some heightaround the time you saw and starteddoing those tricks like visibly way uphigh that's when the the the shifthappened in terms of more acceptancebut I was still labeled as a as like atrick skater robot skater and then youhad Christian osoy who was all Styleair is higher than anyone anytime he dida trick it was going to be so flashy andso amazing and Rockstar personality andRockstar personality and soin that era you I mean it was verydivided it was like no one liked us bothyou know what I meanit was just so strange to be of that ageand of doing something that had neverreally been establishedand then suddenly I'm pitted againstanother skater and we're just trying tomake our way through15 years and and skateboarding and andum it got it was it was hard I mean itwas like I got I got bulliedyou know yes I was successful yes I wasyou but but I would get I would getuh Thrasher magazine would talkabout my performance when I would winyeah I remember that because I was fromNorthern California and Thrashermagazine was a Skateboard Magazine fromNorthern California actually wrote forthem for a while when I was a postdoc tomake some extra money uh under adifferent name folks but you can try andfind those articles they're out thereum and then in Southern California itwas skateboarder mag Transworld mostlyTransworld skateboarding yeah it was atrans World transport skateboarding andThrasher magazine were there were thetwo the rivals right yeah um so yeah Irecall um some of those things that weresaidum it just is amazing to me um but itbrings about a really important lessonwhich is you know that kid that getsmade fun of if they're determined andthey love what they're doing that'sgoing to be the kid that blows everyoneaway later and I know this for surebecause I'll never forget there do youremember the back to the city contestthat were called in San Francisco so Iwent to those they were in the drainfountains in front of City Hall Iremember getting there one day and therewas this guy with kind of like afro-likehair pushing around he was doing whatare called daffies he had twoskateboards he was kind of like weavingaround and I remember thinking you knowSan Francisco's other its issues now butback then it was rough also fordifferent reasons I remember thinkinglike this guy is going to get beat up Ihung out with the Embarcadero crew I waslike this guy's gonna get beat down yeahthat guy was Mark Gonzalez oh yeah soone of the greatestperhaps the greatest Street skateboarderif you can't really Define these thingsgreatest and whatnot in skateboardingumbut you know I remember thinking thisguy's just he's a kook and then Irealized who it was and then I realizedhe was just like any other kid there atsome level and then a lot of the kidsthat got teased early on they stuck withit five years later I'm singing them inthe magazines and I think about thiswith podcasting too there have been somepodcasters they've reached out early onand had questions and you know look attheir stuff and you know one's initialimpression can be like what are theylike what are they doing here and thenyou just see them two years later threeyears later and they're doing amazinglywell and you're like this guy or gal ishere for good they're gonna they'reprobably gonna be top of the game in afew years so you never count anybody outwhen you would go to sleep at night inthat era were you like laying on thepillow going like oh my God people hateme there's stuff in the magazines Igotta push harder this is hard did youtalk to your dad about it I mean againit's a lot to Bear even as an adult Ican only imagine what it's like to bearas a 15 year old kidI didn't really have a support group youknow or any resource to tovoice those concernsumI just knew I wanted to keep gettingbetter that was it and so if anything ifI was worried about those voices if Iwas worried about thewhatever take people had on meI knew I was going to go back to theskate park and learn more tricksum and at some pointI had so much of that as a foundationthat it was sort of undeniable that likewell he can do all this stuff and hedoesn't just do it at his home parkum and I think that's probably when thetide turned for me is when when Istarted to do well at other eventsum namely Upland pipeline which wasfor the most part the most frighteningpool that we could ride the thing wasbig but I also recall like the the hipsas they're called like the transitionsthe way they match up super tighta lot of her giant coping super roughlike if you fell in Upland you'regetting shoot up it's pulling your kneepads down but I didn't know that becausefrom the photos I wouldn't know that ohit was it was treacherous it really waslike it was and and I wanted to do wellat the event and I would drive up thereevery weekend like my friend uh GregSmith was a freestyler but he lived nearUpland and so I would go drive Fridayafter school straight to Upland skate atnight skate Saturday all day skateSunday uh early and then drive homeum because I live in San Diegoand I just made it my mission to tofigure that thing out becausethat was The Proving Ground for meum Emma and so if I could skate that Icould go get anythingas many of you know I've been taking ag1"

try try something went tosleep that night next day made itanything like that yes sometimes I'llwake up the middle of night and I'llwrite down something because it was likeoh there's this trick oh I think I coulddo that yeah okay let me write it downso you dream about skateboarding fromtime to time yeah well yeah that shifteda bit after I got hurt but yeah I usedto dream that I can't skate like I'mtrying and that it feels like the rampsmade of carpet I can't get the speed Ican't get the timing and then as I wentthrough this traumatic injury my dreamsshifted to wow I can skate I can do allmy tricks again oh interesting yeah alittle uh piece of science around thecan't uh can't skate piece or whenpeople feel like they're bolted down ina dream or they can't run away yeahthere's this one phase of sleep calledrapid eye movement sleep where the brainis very active the dreams associatedwith it tend to be very Vivid and at thesame time we are completely paralyzedand the idea is that no one really knowswhy but that it's the case that we'reparalyzed to prevent us from acting outour dreams it's also an interestingneurochemical phenomenon because duringthese rapid eye movement dreams theytend to be very intense but the bodycan't release adrenaline so it's almostlike its own form of trauma therapy it'slike you're experiencing this intensething in your mind but your body can'treact and so oftentimes people uh haveargued that that's why you feel like youwant to move and you can't becauseactually can't yeah some people havewoken up while still a bit paralyzed andREM have you ever had that happen wewake up but actually a couple of my kidshave have struggled with that a coupletimes yeah REM interference is calledit's not dangerous and usually peoplecan jolt themselves out but it's kind ofterrifying so that's interesting sowe'll get to a discussion about the therecent injury and thankfully recoveryfrom the injury not miraculous becausethat makes it seem as if it's surprisingfrankly I'm not surprised that you'verecovered but it is um spectacular uhthe way you have butyou're saying that in your dreams beforethe injury you would think aboutskateboarding but you felt like therewas a kind of can't do it when I wasdoing it in my dream there was alwayssome roadblock that I just cut like whycan't I get any speed why can't I whycan't I snap or do this trick um it'smore in the moments where it's Twilightmoments where I'm kind of awake and I'mthinking about tricks that everythingelse Falls away and I can actually focusonwhat kind of new moves to come up withuman example of that was uhrecentlyI went to the X Games in Japan a fewweeks ago andI was thinking I was going to go more toshow my support and because they had aVerge event there's not a lot of birdevents anymore so if there's a vertevent it's kind of like if you build itI will come because I want to show mysupport that's that's kind of where myheart isand they had a best trick event and Ithought man maybe I could get in thebest trick is there anything new thoughyou know and I'm still recovering frommy leg and then at some point I wasfalling asleep and I thought oh I coulddo that trick and come in 180.I know I could do that with with mycurrent state and not getting that muchspeed soto explain what I was doing is is a halfcab body rail to Backside blunt okay wecan walk through this half cab has comeup backwards come with 360. right sohalf an hour ago as I approach the topof the ramp I body rail that means Ijump aroundand then I jump around on my board andthen I make sure that it lands with mytwo trucks out and my tail on the copingwhich is very precariousand I've done that and come in fakeybeef that's the blunt piece that's theblunt so I've done that right where youand then you have to you have to useyour B to lift up the board come infakie right I've done that I've donethat twiceand I thought well I wonder if there'ssomething I could do like that and thenI realized that if I just keep comingaround and I come inbackside direction that keeps my bodyspinning and that might actually beeasierit wasn't but I figured it outI think I saw a clip of this honest Idid it yeah I mean I did it I did it XGames and I was like it was my last runI was it was I mean it didn't move theneedle I got seven plays but for me itwas a huge moment it felt amazing I betoh yeah for sure I mean and it was Imean it was like weeks ofpreparation and trying to figure thisthing out I made it twice before theeventum on my own alone on my ramp but umthat's just an example of of you know Iwas I was literally falling asleep andthen all of a sudden I was likehalf cup body well back to bluntI love it that liminal State betweenwakefulness and sleep is such abeautiful state that if one is open toideas showing up there yeah they almostalways do I try to start trying it thenext morningdo you ever find that when you're takingwalks or in the shower or not thinkingabout skateboarding yeah it's usually inthe in the sort of mundane moments thatthat I get inspiration yeah do you havepractices for Pure relaxation aside fromsocialization I know I was neverI think that's something I've beenlacking I I never was good at warming upstretchingpost-warm upumor or or relaxing you know meditationnothing I just I I go skate and it's onumand as I've gotten older I realizethat's not the best technique but it'sworked so far it has workedum so for you it's Go Hopefully a littlebit of warm up if you I have more of asort of OCD warm-up runthat I use to gauge how I'm feeling butI kind of have to get through that likea surgeon when a surgeon's about to do asurgeryum they don't warm up they just checkoff the various boxes of you know thisis here that's there make sure thatthey're comfortable in their environmentand then they do they do the life-savingwork yeah yeah I'd say my warm-up run isis kind of basic tricks but they give mea sense of how how stiff or how I what Ineed to adjust for it for the rest ofthe dayso I guess it's not so OCD but it but Idefinitely feel like I gotta go throughthat routinewhat feels the best like I I know that"

I'mnot gonna make the same mistake I didlast time where I tried it low thinkingI just get away with it anymore so thegoing high was more of a safety measurewhich is ironicthe the bigger the ramps for me thesafer it is because I have a betterLanding Zoom I have more time in the airto adjustand even though it looks spectacular andMusic Experience it's just like no Ineed thatI can't skate some eight foot pool Ihave no Landing zone I'm Too Tall I'mtoo I move too slowly now to do thatkind of stuffso that's why you don't see me like inthe Park events and stuff like that youknow you're going to see me on this14-foot boat ramp because that's myhappy place and that's where I'm safeum but also having my wife there I justknew I wasn't gonna get hurt in front ofherbecause I would have been such troublethe the emotional support and pressureis uh is a real thing and in the bestways uh not to focus on the bad aspectsof the injury because there are planningyeah that I recall you and Icommunicated not long after the let'ssay let's call it what it was the firstbreakand I remember you said to me over textyou said how long before I'mskateboarding again and I saidum skateboarding as in pushing orskateboarding as inum what you do on vert you know and yousaid uh what I do on vert and I saidwell it seems you are doing a lot ofthings you were doing deliberate colddelivery heat pressure you do a numberof things I mean you're not haphazardabout your career and your body and yourhealth we'll get into that a little bitlater some of the things that you'veenjoyed as beneficial for you butum you said I'm calling it at two monthsand I said okayum I believe it and then I recall thatyou was it the Oscars or some otheraward event where you came out about aweek later you came out there uh youwalked out this broken femur and youweren't using any support to walk out soyou clearly ditched whatever support youmight have been using uh which I thinkis Awesome by the wayum and then pretty soon I was seeingvideos of you dropping in I'm seeingvideos of you doing kick turns belowcoping I'm seeing videos of you atcoping and you know we have a friend incommon the skateboard and generallyphotographer Mike blaback and I remembertexting Mike I was like Tony's backalready this is this is superhuman ratesof healing and I think it is super humanrates of healingthen you mentioned that youdamaged broke broke the femur again so"

back out thereand I and I get the healing started butI also am comfortable with what peoplethink is extremely risky butin this instanceI want to get back out there right awayand not long after the Academy Awardsuh I was actually walking with a cane atthat time and I ditched the cane just towalk out on stage to present the awardso that was my bigmy big coming out moment but it was kindof forced and as soon as I walked out tostay they grabbed my cane and I washobbling in the backstageum but I wasI was skating kind of a mini ramp andand I was alreadystruggling because I couldn't put myweight on my front foot because my bonesstill had not connected to itself sothere's a gap in the bone but there's athere's a nail what they call a nail oryou know big piece of metal that'sholding them in place but I didn'trealize how careful I needed to be withthat because it was so precariousand I decided I'm going to drop in onthe mini ram like I think I'm ready andand it wasn't the drop in on the mainramp it was me getting to the top of themini ramp and stepping off my boardthat's always that kind of stuff but butI just stepped off my board like I woulddo any other day but I didn't think Iled with my front foot and I felt thebone move in that momentI I really I felt it I felt it eithertwist or get out of placeand I was in total denialfor monthsbecause I just said oh I just it justhurts now like I you know I I got aminor setbackand then I finallyeight months into my recovery sevenmonths into my recovery I was always inpain my skating wasn't progressing Icouldn't get speedand by all measures I should be back atleast I'd be back to a level that I feelgood aboutand I went and got x-rays and they saidyour bone never connected you have anon-union fracture and and and and everytime I skated so my bones like thisevery time I skated I was pushing itfurther awayand so my bone was like this on the lastX-ray and and that was the hard truth sofor those listening just laterallydisplaced think about a pipe that'sbroken in the middle and just one'soffset to the other and and as I keepskating and I I could force my skin likeI kind of learned this hack where I canput 75 of my weight on my back foot and25 of my front foot and do what I wantedto do but it wasn't where I thought I'dbeand it just hurt all the time I mean itreally was like that was my triggerbecause I I have a prettyhigh tolerance to pain andit was always her like I I would dreadgoing to the airport knowing I had towalk to a gateso I knew something was wrong there Iwent to a specialistum that deals in non-union fractures andhe had a very pragmatic factual approachand it was like oh I would do this I'mtaking that nail out and take the otherHardware out and put it together and youcannot move for two monthsdid you obey that at work I did reallyyeah so what what is chilling I was notgoing to risk that again did you um anddo you prioritize things like sleepum nutritionum just you know generally and did youemphasize those things while you wererecovering from the injury yeah I I wasvery disciplined in my diet in myschedule and my sleepum surprisingly I I was very busybecauseum I do speaking engagements andsuddenly my speaking engagements weregetting booked left and rightI mean to the point where I did a tourthrough Europe Last Summerof speaking engagement so that was thatwas a silver lining I guess to my myidle timeum and I leaned into it you know I mademyself available andand uh it you know it's good money andit was it's fun to to interact andum but all through all through that ofcourse in the back of my head I was likewhen when can I skate when can I skateand then when I finally started skatingit was night and day with my leg I feltlike I could lean forwardsuddenly I was learning tricks everyevery session relearning tricksum so I just I'm just lucky that I gotto live in this time of modern medicinewas that two months the longest you'veever gone without skateboarding vertyeahyeah without skating at allnot even just pushing aroundyeah good for you for obeying doctor'sorders and also finally and also goodfor you for deciding that your rate ofrecovery is going to be whatever it isfor you because I feel like I'm hearingboth things on the one hand you listento the medical professionals on theother hand I'm not hearing oh you know Ilooked at the average rate of recoveryfrom this kind of fracture this and thatit's it's like it's as if you decidedtwo things at once that there areexperts who have something to offer mehere I'll follow their advice and yetI'm the expert at myself here I'mputting myself in your first person uhTony's the expert in Tony andI'm going to make sure that I come back100 yeah or betteryeah not better but um and I've and Ihave come to terms with thatbecause I know that I'm not going to bepushing myself the way that I did beforeI got hurt anymorethere are some tricks now that are waymore difficult just because whateversomething changed in my body and forinstance I can't grab slob like I can'tI I can't do it consistently that usedto be my go-to grab you could do thatanytime over 60 foot gaps whatever likeI could I just grab I knew where myboard was I knew that was going to holdon to my feet and half the time I try tograb that way now I don't reach it or Igrab my foot instead and I I don't knowI can't make the adjustment to fix itand so I've just sort of come to termswith well that's not the go-to grabanymoreand that's okay I had a good run yeahyour kid's pretty pretty uh vast sothere's a lot of other things to reachtoo aside from the 540 which by the waycongratulations not only is it a 540 butuh done at least head high I've seen itwith my own eyes and um and under reallygreat circumstances your wife there justthe two of you and after and the trickthat broke the femur in the first placeyeah so um congratulations on that thankyou I'd like to take a quick break andacknowledge our sponsor inside tracker"

yes Ican still do a thing or two uh here andthere um but that's not the point thepoint is that you know the nutritionconsisted largely of you know fast foodor whatever was aroundcigarettes and beer were sort of the theenergy drinks and uh uh and umsupplements of of the times this isfortunately changed but there there wasessentially noHealth promoting tools or aspects to itat all but that was back then but thenover time it seems It's evolved like nowI see um I saw a couple posts fromStevie Williams like he's in the gymsure um I think I saw Danny Way early onworking with Paul check and doing somebalance work neck work because he hadbroken his neck surfing and things ofthat sort so there seems to have been abig shift over the last 15 20 yearswhere skateboarders are taking good careof their bodies like other athletesthinking about the resilience of theirbodies and also generally taking bettercare like a lot of them opt not to drinkand do drugs and all those sorts ofthings so I mean how does it strike youto see the way that skateboarding hasevolved towards the option to be muchhealthier and treat it like a like aserious sport where you're a seriousathlete a word that you know even 15years ago 20 years ago if you called askip order an athlete some people mighteven be offended by oh yeah people inskateboarding right absolutely yeahumwell to answer your question in theearly daysthat was part of the the scene and theculture just because the the it was theantithesis to organize team sportsand mainstream culture and so it wasjust like yeah this is what we doit who cares like we drank and we skateand everyone it was it was Wild Westrightbut as I never fell into that deeplybecause I saw how it affected people'sperformances and the skating itself wasParamount to me that is what I want tofocus on that's what I want to be goodat and I saw people partying andpartying their skills away so I had atleast that forethoughtum and then as scanning got moreestablished popularmore of a career option than peoplestarted taking it more seriouslyespecially competitors I mean and andbut there's such a wide swath of of whatskateboarding is and it's a big tent soto say that it's more organized yes it'smore organized over here there's stillall these skaters over here partyinghopping fencesdon't care about contests don't wantsponsors oh like GX 1000 like those kidsat bomb Hills in San Francisco like likebut that that's what I love about it isthe diversity of it all and that that'swe're all part of this scene soI I was a competitor that was that wasmy path to success and so I appreciatethat people take it more seriously nowand that they do have trainer they haveresources I mean they have sponsors thatwill pay for this kind of stuffthere was no such thing I mean like atour biggest skate contest we were allstaying at Stacy Peralta's parents housethe night before and he would take usout to get spaghetti because he thoughtcarbohydrates was going to give usenergy the next day that was the extentof training in 1983.right but nowadays it we're treated likeHigh Elite athletes because they arelike if you really look at people thatare at the top of their field peoplelike Niger Houstonyou know what I mean like the dude is amachine he ishe is one of the most precise skatersthat we've ever seen or precise athletesthis side of Nadia coming eachyou know yes I'm I'm I'm aging myselfbutwhat I'm saying is like this is this istakes hardcore dedication Precisionathleticism anddevotion and so now they have theresources to back that up and to keep itgoing longer I mean yeah would I be ableto do this now especially after gettinghurt without the help of a doctor ofphysical trainingprobably notI'd do it on some level but I wouldn'tget to where I am nowum and so hey I think it's awesome I youknow I I never I never wanted to covetskateboarding as this thing that no oneelse could like a gatekeeper to it noone else can touch it I always thoughtthere was something to skateboardingthat was magical and that was good formental health and that wasthat was required suchumrequired such passionand I didn't I never understood why Ididn't get bigger through those thoseleaning years it was always like kidsthis speaks to kids like it's Daredeviland it's active and it's exciting andyou can do it as a group but you can doit your own way and I don't know allthose things it took a long time foreveryone else to figure it out theydefinitely figured it out I meannowadays skaters are the cool kids inschool yeah it's in the Olympics likethere was always discussion would it beit was an exhibition sport in theOlympics at one point no uh no no oh Ithought it was it for maybe it had a runit potentially being an exhibition therewere there was talk about it got it umbut it never did and and not that I meanat some point especially in the late 90sor 2000sskatingwas getting appreciated and and kind ofreached that threshold of of is itmainstream well it's in it's allMcDonald's commercials so I guess that'spretty mainstream and so we already hadcome of age and it was like we don'tneed the Olympicswe're already more popular thana lot of Olympic sports right so why dowe need their validation and then atsome point it became like the the powerDynamic shifted and it was like oh theyneed our cool Factorwe don't need their validationand I was like yeah okay you guys wantit surego ahead but hold the events hold thequalifierswe'll participatebutwe don't need thiswell you've been an amazing Ambassadorfor the sport that's driven so much of"

            "text": "that wider acceptance and progressionand invitation into different domainsone of the um things that I definitelywant to talk about is the video gameright because I think that the videogame changed a lot of things for thegeneral public in terms of theirperception of skateboarding I mean whatit allowed of course is this is obviousbut it allowed kids that weren't goingto you know um bang up their shins orwalk in with a broken wrist or you knowall skinned up too to do incredibletricks but in silico on a screen rightand toand pretend that they are the the proskateboarder that's essentially whatwhat video games are about And yet whenyou can see something just like you canimagine it in a dream or while you'refalling asleep and you can see somethingand and hear an air quotes do somethingin a video game it also is going toinspire a number of kids to go outsideand grab a real skateboard and try thator try something like that so clearlythe video game was a catalyst for what Iconsider now the the wide acceptance ofskateboarding as a sport in all itsvarious formsum could you just talk for a little bitabout the Genesis of the video game wereyou into video games prior to the videogameum were you into technology generallyand and what sort of motivated theinterest in the video game because itcertainly has changed the face of actualskateboarding and the perception ofskateboardingum well I've been into video games sincethe gecko I mean I was a kid you knowplaying pong Pac-Man Missile CommandQbert you name it and then getting thehome systems in television Super NESCommodore 64.umSega yeah but but I um and I always lovetechnology so when I when I finallystarted making money in the 80s my firstkind of big purchase in terms of thatuh in in terms of electronics was uhCommodore Amigawhich was considered one of the highestend uh home computers you know alongsideMac but but more graphic oriented andand more game-orientedum and so I was always into that ideathat you could do this kind of stuff athome not just in arcadesand then I gotta I got a call from a PCprogrammer that wanted to pitch a skategame and had a crude engine of um askater that would cruise around go inbowls and stuff like that and it was allkeyboard controlled it was clunky but itwas something and the last thing that wehad as skating was720 in the arcade or a skate or die forhome systems for Commodore 64. that waslike the last thing that had happenedfor skateboardingum in video games and so I went with himI was excited to get like I got towe got to go to Nintendo and Pitch itum we went to Midway you know we went toall these different uh console andsoftware manufacturersand were just told that this is a badidea skateboarding is not popularhome video games are barely a thing whywould anyone want to buy a video gameabout skateboardingsomeone said those exact words to meum at Midwayand so he got frustrated and he neededto find a job and I was I was just kindof free-floating so I said okay he goeswell I'm gonna I'm not going to do thisbut I feel like you've establishedyourself at least in the Video GameWorld uh industry that you're interestedin doing something so maybe if someonedoes something they'll call you and Iwas like yeah right sure sure enoughlike a year later Activision called meand they said hey we heard you want todo a video game I said well yes I wouldlove to work on a video game I'm not aprogrammer or anything so we havesomething we're working on and we'd liketo show it to you and so I went up toActivisionum they were working on a skate game butit was based on an engine of a game thatwas already released called apocalypsestarring Bruce Willis so the firstversion of my game was Bruce Willis on askateboardwith a gun shot to his backin a desert Wasteland doing kickflipsand it was awesome it was it was trulylike I picked it up and I got past thatVisual and then I started playing it andand it was intuitive it the motion feltright the engine was right and I waslike this isthis is the Baseline of somethingspecialI didn't think it was going to be somebig hit I just thought this is this isgoing to be appreciated by skateboardersand that was my goal the entire uhdevelopment process which was about ayear and a half after I signed on wethrough that year and a half we weregoing back and forth with they wouldthey would FedEx me builds on CDs I hada modified PlayStation and I would playit make notes and I thought man skaterwas going to dig this and that was itand skating wasn't even that popular itwas coming to you know it was startingto get some traction what year was thisagain like 98 so it was like X Gameswere starting to come into the foldpeople were taking note of whatskateboarding had become at that pointand then I thought this is going to becool skater's gonna like it and thenumnot long before the releasethey called me and they said hey we wantto um we want to offer you a buyout offuture royalties for this gameum because I think you know there's Ithink people are going to like it I waslike what does that mean they go we'llgive you a half a million dollars andthen you don't get royalties goingforward but you get that money up frontandat that time my life like to hearsomeone say half a million dollarsseriously sounded like a half a billiondollarslike no one had evertalked about numbers that big to me wellalso 98 was a little bit of a of a quiettime for verts skateboarding too rightsure yeah but yeah for yeahluckily vert skatingstill was a thing because of inlineskatingbecause inline skating was huge rightlate 90s and they were all vert and sowe as skaters got to sort of ride thosecoattails because it was like Hey Thereare boat ramps because everyone'srollerblading I forgot about that thatdid like and I have honestly like I wasthe special guest at a couple of inlinerollerblade shows where it was like thisis what team rollerblade live andspecial guest Tony Hawk the skateboarderand I was like hey all right dropping inbut it paid the bills yeahum so to answer to like to toperform what you're saying bird skatingwasit was a thing at least established inthe X Gameswhich was something and enough for us tomake a livingum so when they offer me this moneyI actually was in a pretty good placeum in terms ofmy I don't know my options my mytrajectory and I felt like and I I hadjust bought a new home and I thought I'mgonna take a chance and to see whathappensand like that was the best financialdecision I ever met took the equityyeah I just let it ride I was like no Iwant to see what happens with this andas soon as the game was released it wasgettingStellar reviews and then I remember likethe very next week after it was releasednever stopped saying okay we're workingon number two what do you want to dolike what do you meanwell yeah we're doing SQL which whatawesome and then we ended up doing like10.amazing crazy amazingI'm thinking about your decision to nottake the cash and to see how it would goI'm thinking about your decision to buy"

no money toget back up to Northern California andthey couldn't get a hold of my momum they took me to your home but thenthey took me to where you were livingthe next day which was in Fallbrook youdon't remember this but I do and I knowyou've heard this story before soforgive me because most people listeninghaven't but I remember getting driven upto Fallbrook you had the ramps in yourbackyardI walked in got introduced to you youwere very gracious said hello what's upI said feel free to push around on theramps outside it was the mini it was aspine ramp yeahum two ramps back to back folks it'sfine uh sorry nomenclatureum I think Ray Underhill was thereyeah he lived there for a while yeah andas I recall you hadum pretty vast music collection andwe'll talk about musicum but it also seemed there was a couplecars in the driveway and whatnot butit's clear to me based on a number ofthings and that interaction and what Iobserved there that either you hadsomeone in your ear either your dad oryour mom or both or maybe it had beenStacy or maybe it was somebody else whowas advising you to make very goodfinancial decisions like not spend allyour money or continue to spend all yourmoneyum to invest in things you know or maybeit was just instilled in you at a youngage who knowsI'm asking because I think so manypeople burn their early success you knowwhat represents a lot of wealth for themearly on they burn that where they startmaking just bad decisions you explainedbefore why you tended to avoid drugs andalcohol and certainly um any severerelationship to drugs or alcohol thatwould keep you from progressing andskateboarding but you know the abilityto make really good decisions as a youngfamous athleteis more rare than it is commoneven when people have coaches so I'mcurious you know where did that umshrewdness and that Prudence come fromand was Frank your dad and maybe Nancyalso you know advising you all alonglike hey you knowum think smart be smart because clearlyyou've made some some very smartdecisions um he was definitelya guide in it he he was the first onewho said you should probablybuy real estate I was 17 so I didn'teven know that was possible but heco-signed made it possibleum but then after that I ended up buyingthat home that you went to and it wasfour acre property and we built theseramps on it and that was amazing anddefinitely helped Propel my skating to adifferent level than I ever imagined butat some point that was just a drain andit was a drain financially and I wasliving beyond my means and my incomekept dropping because we're talkingabout not long after that was 91 92 theslowest days of skating and I've gotthis giant mortgageand I've got this property and theseramps that I can't afford to upkeep Ican barely afford my water bill at onepoint you know and sowhat you saw might have seemed stablebut behind the scenes it was it wasstarting to unravel birdhouse hadn'tbeen started birdhouse was started in 92and when I started birdhouse I took theequity from that house to start itbecause I didn't I burned through mysavings from trying to keep this placegoingum so I took a second mortgage out onthat house right I took my Equity outstarted birdhouse sold the house forwhat I had taken out and then moved tomy original place that I had when I wasin high school and justpulled back on expenses I think that wasthat was when I really became shrewdbecause I had to I had I had a firstchildI had an income that was very uncertainvery fluctuating and I was just eatingTaco Bell and Top Ramen and peanutbutter jelly sandwiches and andnot spending anything and and takingevery joblike the most random demo requests or wewant you to be a consultant on thiscommercial because I'm too old I'm 24.I'm too old to be the guy skatingbecause it has to be youth right butthey're like well we want to see what'spossible so can you come up the daybefore and show us the ropes and so Iwould be the stunt skaterthat's filling in to show them theAngles and stuff and then they would gohigher Chet Thomasas the young kidand then I would stand around I wasgetting paid I didn't care I think Iremember those commercials It Was aSerial commercial something like that uhthe serial commercial was uh ChrisMiller Frosted Flakes right and I wasTony the Tigerguys you chat uh yesum I throughout the birdhouse which isyour company but without telling peoplewhat is a skateboard company I rememberuh Willie Santos was early on I rememberhis super nice kid I used to see him atthe contest I remember thinking wellTony Hawk has his own company forskateboarders we had a team you knowlike willy willy was a maestroum Jeremy Klein legendary Street Pioneeruh Steve Berra who's kind of a we calledit ATV but Street and vertum we had uh ocean Howell it was likeour number one amateur we had AndrewReynolds Matt Beachum we had a team it was full on was itfun to move from Ryder to also Ryder butteam manager owner was it fun it just itwas just necessaryI can't say it was fun I mean yeah itwas it was fun because we were stilljustkind of Reckless anddriving you know six of us in a vandriving to skate shops across thecountry andbegging them for 300 bucks so that wecould get gas and food in the hotel roomandget on our wayumI don't know it just it but for me itjust felt like a necessity to keep to tothat was what I had to do to make abrand happenand so I was willing to do itum and butit was exhaustingyeah because I had to be thehad to be the the coachand the tour managerand the skateryou know I was putting myself out thereon like the worst conditionsand just rolling my ankle left and rightand it was and it was all Street and itwas just wasn't my thing it was it washard but I just I loved it it made ithappen in my mind I'm thinking you hadto be Tony Hawk the skateboarder FrankHawk the organizer yeah and StacyPeralta the yeah because Stacy had beena pro skateboarder I still think of himas a skateboarder yeah even though he'sfilmmaker right skateboard just like Istill think of Spike Jones'sskateboarder bmxer filmmakerum seems like you had to integrate allof thoseand I mentioned that becauseI am curious I think a lot

momentwe got to get herewe got to get to Dallas by tomorrowlike as soon as this Demo's over gettingthe van we're goingum we gotta get a hotel roomyou know it was just stuff like that itwas it was very much but but I Irespected I think I learned to respectumpunctualitybecause I travel with playing at skatersthat were not and didn't care and showup late and was like dude and like Idon't know these guys and then when Iwas in charge it was like we're going tobe on time because we have to respectother people's timeand we said we're going to be here atthree o'clock we're going to be therethree o'clockum andthat's not easy with a skate crewMike blaback who as you know is it's agirl to the Hebrew and Lab podcast Italk about that we've got some otherum guys that came over from DC to asfilmers and editors for us and you knowthey're so punctual and they're so on itand I notice you showed up early todayright right on timer earlyum early by five minutesum and that is a distinguishing factor Ithink in any occupation but especiallyin skateboarding where there's this kindof looseness sure and so if you do showup on time it really means a lotum the professionalism that you know wasinstilled in you it's it's clear thatdifferent places where that's showing upmentioned the shrewdness about thebusiness decisions I'm curious aboutanother aspect of that which is maybe alittle more cryptic which is you knowwhether or not it was the CD collectionthat I saw or your mentioned of the caryou're just in video games it seems thatone thing that you've done that a lot ofguys that I knew because back then bythe way it was mostly guys now so wesaid they're women doing it tooum women and girlsit seems like you have a lot of otherhobbies and interests music and Etc butthat we never heard about you gettinglike distracted or pulled down thoselines like we didn't hear about yougoing and surfing and getting hurt hurtsurfing so that you couldn't skate we'regetting really into motorcycles or raceracing cars right you know um somepeople went hard left out ofskateboarding into that like Ken Blockthe late great Ken Block but that becamehis main thing seems like you you knewthat skateboarding was the main frameand stayed with thatum and yet you have a lot of otherinterests yeah I think I I wellwith other sports especiallylike Motocross I I have this hugerespect for Motocross I think it's superexciting I would love to do it and Iknow that I would not Escape unscathedlike I would definitely want to learnthe tricksdo whips and flips and whatever and I'mgonna get hurt and I I don't want torisk my skate career for that so I Ipurposely pulled away from that type ofthingum the last knee surgery I had isbecause I overshot a jump in Mammoth onmy snowboard so that was a lesson I waslike don't what are you doing justCruise why yeah stay on the ground righthit the powder right you know free ridewith your Bros because I learned mylesson and so so yeah you're right butat the same time like I still I stilllove going surfing and snowboarding Idon't do them as much obviouslyum but but those are part of of what Idid all growing upum and they're important to meum I did you know do a couple ofcelebrity car races like a NASCAR raceandum I totaled a car in the Long BeachGrand Prixbecause this dude ramming to the walland it was like well that was fun butI'm notI don't I don't have the bandwidth toget that serious about it and now youhave a family of course too so of courseyeah I mean and and those things as funas they are and as asI don't knowumas sort of auxiliary as as they are theyrequire a lot of timeI mean just for instance that Long BeachGrand Prix they want you to go stay inPalmdale for like a week and a half andtrainand and figure out how to truly know howto drive and be safe and it's like Idon't know I ain't got time for thatyeah that's time you're notskateboarding or with your family rightyeah right now I feel the same way if Iget pulled away from Reading papers andprepping podcasts andreading the latest research and thinkingabout experiments we could do then I formore than a couple of days I startedfeeling the itch I have a feeling thisstuff is programmed into one's nervoussystem after a while like you've beenskateboarding for so long that if you goa few daysit probably just your system is iswater or something oh yeah for sure Imeanum well just for instance uh our ramp isuh being torn down on Sunday today isFriday our Ram is being turned on onSunday at 10 A.M to be moved to SaltLake City for our big bird eventI'm going there at 8 30.so I can get a session before I canstart down I love it on Father's Daythat's my father's day I'm going to workat 8 30 a.m on Sunday I love itspeaking of family and lineage uh tell"

aname for himself uh Riley and he's 30.yeah he kills it on Street he's a bigstreet skateboarder he does yeah um butthat you know they're they're all goodthey're all good skaters in their ownways and uhit's so fun I mean I I I didn't ofcourse they're surrounded by it theirwhole life especially Riley because whenhe was young I I didn't really have themeans to have child care whatever so Ijust said take him with me on tourismand whatnot so he was always around itso he got good at it by default but atsome point started to shy away from himbecause he felt the pressure and MyShadow and it was like I don't thisisn't fun I don't people expect me to besuper good or I have to do this stuffand so he went shied away from it butthen founda bunch of his friends in high schoolthey love skating he's still good at usso he that he found his crew and they'veall found their Crewsuh completely independent of me and sowhen we go on vacationfor instance we we were last year wewere in uh or two years ago we were onthe big on Hawaii they want to go to SkiparksI don't want to go to the skate parksI'm on vacation it's also a little harshstuff it's a great way to get hurt rightwhat's that over in Hawaii it's allweather worn oh yeah and it's not evenmy scene but but then so I go I'm I'm soI'm their chauffeur and I'm their FilmerI love it that's my vacation but butbecause they all love it so much youknow what I mean and it just it's socool like I mean how could I ever askfor more it's amazinglet's talk about Frank and Nancy alittle bit just because I have this kindof odd connection to your family throughthose uh it's really two or three dayinteraction changed my life forevermeeting you was spectacular as a youngskateboarding kid but also just the ideathat someone would literally take meinto their home I mean they had everyreason to not trust me first of all Iwas hanging out with Billy Waldman noexplanation needed the people who knewBilly I hope he's doing well I haven'theard anything about him but hope he'sdoing wellum but we were wild but he basicallytook me into your home he and Nancy tookme inum you know fed usum or fed meum I had another friend with meum and you know it I just have tosay as you're describing your family Ican only imagine what it must have beenlike for Frank and Nancy to see you haveyour kids did they get toum live long enough to see uh that Rileyand your other kids were skateboardersmy dad met Riley uh but my dad passedaway when Riley was twoso he's the only one of my kids thatthat he met yeahum my older sibling uh had kids so hemettwo of his other grandkids besides Rileyum my mom got to see some of Riley'ssuccess but uh she suffered fromAlzheimer's dementia and so thingsslipped away but umI I think that uhmy dad would not believe thatskateboarding is in the Olympicsto him that's that is the top of themountain because he was really intoother sport he loved Sports he loved theOlympics he loves he loved watchingfootball he loved watching baseball heloves when the Olympics were on he justhe loved the competition element and thehype of it and and I think there waspart of him that felt like why isn'tskateboarding in this you know but heknew that there were so many hurdles toget through and so much more acceptancethat needed to happen andI don't think he imagined would everhappenyeah he was a special guy I can stillhear his voice he was a very large guytoo I don't know if he I was justsmaller then I definitely was smaller ohyeah no I mean he had like a bigpresence and um and I know I've told youthis many times before this is actuallyhow we got reconnected I sent you adirect message and said hey I met yourparents in fact they took me into yourhome and I'm telling the truth andyou'll know I'm telling the truthbecause they took me to dinner and theyordered black coffee after dinner andyou know for years I would order blackcoffee after dinner you know as a kidyou're just so impressionable thesereally nice people took me in I was likewow this is what a really healthy familylooks like I'm grateful to have lovingparents I always did but yeah I didn'thave the healthy family structure so forme it was like oh my goodness thesepeople drink black coffee after thismust be what healthy families do so bythe way folks don't drink caffeinewithin eight hours of going to sleep butum but I still do that but well you itdoesn't seem to be holding you backum individualized butum yeah it's spectacular that thislineage of you know Frank to you and andI I mentioned and Nancy because it seemslike while she might not have been atthe contest and run around setting uptables and doing all that like sheclearly was supportive as well oh oh shewas I did a lot of the events too I meanthey needed all hands on deck when itstarted getting big and no one wastaking salaries you know that's thething is that people thought like ohyour dad's like cashing on he never tookup money for any of thatand he took so much you know what Imean he just he just loved it it was foryou wellit was for me and it was also for theMisfits that I surrounded myself withand even though he was he was Brash andhe was like you know he was uh I don'tknow what's the wordhe was foreboding and intimidating andwhatever else he did it for all thosekids that were kind of lost like you Imean really like he he loved that itbrought them together that he gave thema sense of self it gave them a sense ofpurpose he saw that because he he wasthat he he really had a rough childhoodand he did everything he could throughhis adult life to make up for it withhis own kids and with the kids that theysurrounded themselves with so that'sthat's what he loved about it of coursehe loved seeing me Thrive too but heloved that he created the safe space andthis this sense of community and so mymom my mom was that was her thing wasgetting people togethergatheringsyou know oh we should all get togetherlikeeven even my siblings and I as much aswe want to emulate our parents we don'tdo it as much that as they did and weregret thatwell there's still time no we I mean wedo but yeah um It's Tricky we're alldifferent areas sure yeah the the personthat comes to mind when I think aboutyour dad I'm forgetting the movie butthere's this one Clint Eastwood moviewhere he lives in a neighborhood where Ithink it's a bunch of young Hmong oh isthat gangsters El Camino El Camino yeahand I just remember like there's thatscene of like Clint coming out on hisporch and just standing really uprightyeah everything in his front his frontlawn is everything's super manicured andjust standing there like this immensepresence and that's how I remember FrankHawk yeah but he was a total softythat's the thing that's that's the youknow there there was a it was it was alla frontwell he was certainly very precious likeyou you know you you got you got to seethat side of him where it's just like ohyeah come on we'll we'll take you outyou want to go see Tony's Place let's golike that's not some hard asswell there's a tail end of the story toowhere he actually called my momand I think there may have been astatement or two about hey this kid's 14like he can't be in Linda Vista BoysClub taking the bus back to Lancaster etcetera et cetera may have been somediscussion like that but then they alsopaid for me to go home oh yeah they flewme home yeah so I think I owe you acouple hundred bucks for a Southwestflight or whatever Airline it was wellit's it's fun and I think important toreminisce about these people becauseum they aren't just your parents butthey've done so much and through you youknow I I really think thatum emotions and stories are really likethe equivalent of energy in humans youknow when people talk about energybecause that gets carried forwardumspeaking of which we share a common love"

Burnsidethey gotteased ridiculed it was hard on themsuper hard yeah super hard now largelythrough Instagramum but some other channels as well youcan see this young girl Rhys onvertskateboarding better than a lot of grownmen who have been skateboarding fordecades I mean um and then there are anumber of other ones in the um in Streetskateboardingum and also taking really hard slamslike you know so this this is a completerevision of the recent history ofskateboarding thoughts on that and um onReese and there are a few others was itis it um Lizzy who uh took a really badfall that was filmed right there broketheum Knack offer femur yeah yeah these aretough ladies yeah yeah I'm doing it andfor coming back Lizzy Lizzy did the loopshe did the full 360 Loop first woman toever do itso what do you think changed like thatthat paved the way is it just you know acritical mass of uh females doing it isit thatum you know Sky Brown you know for surefor sure there were there were thePioneers people like care about theBurnsideum and uh uh there's so many others umPatty Hoffman was one of the one of thefirst verse skaters to who were theyplanted the seed and and then there wereother women that took inspiration likeoh girls can do thiseven though they're largely outnumberedand they get hassled for sure and thenthrough the street eraum people like Alyssa Steamer who whopaid the way for legit Street skatingum but thenthrough the years it started to becomemore commonmore accepted which is dumb to saybecause it's just always been it shouldhave always been accepted but the thingthat that really tipped the scale waswhen everything was leading up to theOlympicsthere had to be equal divisions in equaldisciplinesfor men and womenand suddenly there was no question ofshould we have a should we have awomen's event like no we have to have amanagement because that's how we that'sthe road to qualifying for this theOlympic stageand Vance Park series to their creditthey were holding events simultaneouslynot that we're Olympic qualifiers butjust their own and they said theseevents are equal across the board equalprize money equal attention I mean itwas just like that that was just amatter of fact and that shifted a lotit really did now if you go to askateparkyou see plenty of them there yeah it'sawesome like literal women like moms youknow there's there areolder women that are learning how toskate it's awesomenot that it matters so much but doesanyone claim to be the first female do540 on vert is that sort of a known thatwould be Lindsay Adamsfantasticum and she did that I'll tell you howshe did thatshe was trying itum so she's trying she's trying to maketwists uh she's married to TravisPastrana it's like the you knowit's like the the Elite action sportscoupleum and she was trying them she was shewas getting pretty close and then we dida big exhibition in Paris at the uhGrand Palais on behalf of quicksilver itwas a huge eventum they put a half pipe up and we didthis giant showthere were thousands of people there andit was very muchumunspoken but expected that I was goingto do 900 at this eventum I think it was I want to say it was2010 Maybeand uh or no like 2009andand the organizers were kind of likeokay so we're gonna do this and then youknow at some pointyou do a 900 and I was like I I can'tguarantee that ever like every time I'veever made it it's been prettyspontaneous I've you know I've set outto do it and not I've come up short Ican't guarantee it I'll try I'll tryand they they're like yeah yeah okay andso I knew the whole time when they wereskating I was like okay everyone'sexpecting this so I kind of went throughthe motions of of uhdoing my exhibition tricks you knowplaying the hits and then started trying900s and at the same time Lindsaystarted trying 540s because she wasfeeling that energyand so it was this sort of not battlebut definitely we were we were tradinghits it was like all right here goesTony no he missed it and here goesLindsay oh she missed it and thenI uhshe almost made one like was riding downyou know and and then fell at the flatbottomit was like oh and then I made 900 andit was kind of the show stopperbecause like that's what they expectedand everyone's going crazy and whateverpeople are coming down off the ramp kneesliding down and we're saying goodbye tothe crowd and I look up and Lindsay putsher tail outthere's still people standing on therampand she puts her tail out and I was likeI think Lindsay wants to try it againhere we go I'm on the mic nowshe made itlove it she stole the showlike without question it was huge youcan look it up on on YouTube like it'sthere Lindsay Adams first first 540. itwas awesome and then she made it and weall grabbed her and put her on hershouldersthat is awesome it was pretty cool thatwas awesome because these things arelike the four minute mileas a barrier then people break thatbarrier and then other people break thatbarrier it's I mean I I watched enoughof skateboarding recent years see youknow like the sky Brown thing she'sphenomenal and I actually saw her familyout to dinnerhere in Los Angeles and um with herbrother and her folks are reallygracious really nice and there again youknow parents going to the skate parkafter all she's couldn't drive herself Ithink she's at that time she wasprobably like nine you know probably

yeah now now kidsare like parents are pushing them intoit get out there learn tricks it's likewait that's not what we're supposed tobe doing butit's cool that that I think it I thinkwith the the really cool factor of allthat is there are definitely people ourageI'm grouping you into my age category47. all right yeah plus enoughum but but that have kids and andskateboarding was such a special time inour life and then they're rediscoveringit through their kids and they'reskating together and I think that's justso amazingthat someone of our age would be likeyou know what I used to do that you'reinto that like let's go and then youcould show your kid how to do a sweeperI could probably do that I don't havekids yet but when I do I'll show Iintend on being healthy enough and yeahto do a sweeper people can look upsweeper we don't have to explain it forhim but a little laid back grind or asweeper yep oh yeah because they won'tthey wouldn't think to do it no and theyare doing all these difficult fliptricks and that's not my it's not myscene oh yeah what's your go-to on agame escape if you're gonna really liketake out the younger generationum I can do Impossibles pretty uhpretty regularly on transitionconsistently I knew I'm flat so this iswhere basically you scrape the back ofthe it's an ollie really but it wrapsaround the back of it over your footyeah um that's kind of my my sneakattack on game's Escape does RodneyMullen get credit for that trick stilloh yes that's yeah it's a Rodney are youstill in touch with Rodney absolutelyyeah yeah he's somebody that umcertainly deserves deserves mention inthe pioneering of tricks I think if he'sthe Godfather of modern skateboarding Ithink of Rodney you and Mark Gonzalezgons as like the the guys that I'mhonored drove theum the progression in differentpartially overlapping directions thatset the template for us I learnedfingertips because of Rodney like thefirst trick you saw me do I learned thatbecause I saw Rodney do it on the groundand I thought wellI can't do it on the ground but I haveplenty of time in the air to do itit's awesome it's awesome that Stacy putyou guys together we we mentioned BonesBrigade but we didn't really talk aboutthe architecture of it from theperspective of skateboard progressionbut it wasum kind of like any good band it seemedlike there was really good chemistryyeah um interpersonally but alsoum that there was each person hadsomething unique you skated the way youdid Mike skate the way he did Stevie theway he did and you know Rodney and youknow and we respected each other but wealso fed off each other Tommy Guerreroyep right because growing up in the BayArea like yeah in fact Tommy's gettingthe hills of San Francisco in thosevideos makes it look easy yeah but thoseHills are are rough they're dangerousand they have real life obstacles likemoving buses you'll notice he wasn'tstopping his top signs so that'sfantastic uh we could reminisce aboutall these angles but the the point beingthat umspending time with people who do similarthings or the same thing but do itdifferently is one of the best ways toprogress that's why I routinely fly toTexas and hang out with Peter attiaanother podcaster Lex Friedman justbecause they do things differently thanI doum where do you draw sort of peripheralinspiration from now like I know you Isee Jimmy Wilkins at your ramp quite alot the Phenom Jimmy Wilkins it's kindof eerie how good that kid isum who else are you spending time withbesides Rhys and one of the reasons Iasked this is that skateboarding isunique among many sports in thata given session a gathering uh toskateboard will include an enormousfive-year-old man and 10 year old girlsexactly yes which is which is incredibleyou don't think about soccer you know aserious game of soccer betweenprofessional soccer but also it's noteven that we're skating together is thatwe arecommunicating and influencing each otherI mean that is likethe last conversation I have with Rhyswas she's talking about like are yougonna try to do 540 stand I go yeah I'mkind of working on it she goes well Ithink because she saw me try one shegoes I think you need to pull out alittle more and she was rightand she's how old again she's 10.and I and I didn't even consider thatbecause I'm just back in my mode and I'mnot taking into consideration that Idon't have the snap that I had before Igot hurt and she was I mean that was onekey to me making itand you know did that that's but it butto me that's justthat's representative skateboarding andthe inclusivity of it and the diversityof it where it's me I'm 55 there's 30year old uhPros that are at the top of the gamethere are 17 year oldup and comers men women 10 year old girlthat is doing tricks that we've nevereven thought ofor want to doand it's all part of thethe whole mix that's really beautiful Iwant to ask you about"
