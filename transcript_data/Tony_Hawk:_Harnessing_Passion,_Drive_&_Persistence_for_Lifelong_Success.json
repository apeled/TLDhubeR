            "text": "welcome to the huberman Lab podcast where we discuss science and science-based tools for everyday life I'm Andrew huberman and I'm a professor of neurobiology and Ophthalmology at Stanford school of medicine today my guest is Tony Hawk Tony Hawk is one of the most celebrated and accomplished professional skateboarders of all time for more than 40 years he has been at the Forefront of the sport and I don't mean just doing a sport for more than 40 years I truly mean he has been at the Forefront of skateboarding developing new Maneuvers AKA tricks that include incredible Feats like the 900 and 900 degree spin in the air as well as numerous other Maneuvers that have really pushed the entire sport forward he's also completely popularized the sport through his video game and through his ambassadorship for skateboarding in fact few if any names are synonymous with skateboarding in the general public as Tony Hawk and he is oh so deserved of that title because for more than 40 years he has shown up as the consummate professional he is kind he is respectful and he is completely committed to his craft and that shows up in every aspect of his life he still to this day skateboards daily and as you'll soon learn he recently suffered a major injury a complete break of his femur that is the bone in his upper leg and this is what many people would consider a career-ending injury not only did Tony come back from that injury but he went back to the very trick on which he broke his femur and recently completed that trick that is a 540 or so-called mitt twist I mentioned this because at every level of his life Tony has demonstrated himself to be somebody with Incredible Drive incredible vision and incredible persistence and today we talk about that dry vision and persistence and we talk about what it takes to set a goal and to continually evolve one's goal and to continually progress as a basically young pre-teen as a teenager as a young adult as an adult and well let's face it as a 55 year old man he is now heading a little bit past middle age although we do hope that he lives forever Tony Hawk AKA The Birdman really does seem to be superhuman but as you learned today he is oh so human in the way that he shares his own experience and shares with you the ways in which we can each and all look at what we do and think about what we want to achieve and put our minds and our bodies to those goals and Achieve them I confess that today's discussion with Tony Hawk was a particularly thrilling one for me to have I grew up in the sport of skateboarding so I had met Tony previously although he doesn't remember it that was many years ago in fact I met his parents you'll learn more about that story during today's episode but I was aware of course of Tony's accomplishments I was also aware of his philanthropy so he has a skatepark Foundation I also listened to his podcast with another professional skateboarder Jason Ellis called Hawk vs wolf we provided a link to that podcast in the show note captions as well but never before have I had the opportunity to sit down and talk to the Tony Hawk and learn from him so I was absolutely delighted to have this conversation and it far exceeded my already lofty expectations before we begin I'd like to emphasize that this podcast is separate "

            "text": "I'm particularly thrilled to have this conversation because I've tracked your career for a very long time grew up in the skateboard thing I I know had your poster on my wall oh thank you your name is synonymous with skateboarding as you know I think a question that probably get asked from time to time but let's just clarify the data from the outset Tony Hawk is your real name right yes Anthony Frank Hawk but I never went by Anthony I mean my parents call me Tony since I could remember so it's a fitting name given the sport and what you do and we will get into this a little bit later when we talk about family and parenting and parents um but I'll allude to the story now that uh when I was 14 years old your parents took me in yeah I slept in your bed in your home so wild not with you in it but surrounded by your a near infinite number of trophies and and um it must have been right after I moved out so this would be I was 14 years old maybe I'll just tell the story now very briefly I was 14 years old I was at a contest at Linda Vista Boys Club everyone left me and another kid named Billy Waldman uh we're still there your dad said where where are you going um it was clear that I didn't know where I was going my life was I was a wayward youth at that time and so they took me in for uh a night maybe even two nights your mom uh Nancy and your dad Frank were so gracious brought me in into your home took me to dinner um I mean that tracks that would definitely my dad and my mom together would be doing that yes incredible people um and we'll get back to that story later because you and I actually met uh the next day in Fallbrook at your ramp but so it had been 88 89 that's right I'm gonna say I'm gonna say 89. okay and it must have been one of the either NSA or Castle contests yeah that your dad was very active in well we'll get back to that but uh I have so many questions that relate to skateboarding to you and really as a neuroscientist to the whole concept of a life of continual progression because but they're not people listening to this and watching this are skateboarders or not and I imagine that most of them are not it's absolutely clear that you've been in this game a very long time and that you've somehow managed to continue to progress over and over to come back from very severe injuries and somehow keep getting better and better so the first question I have is about the younger version of you um did you have any sort of self-concept like you know I want to be a pro athlete or I want to be a skateboarder or I want to have a video game named after me right right exactly um you know but if you can think back to maybe even pre-skateboarding do you remember what your self-concept was you know this notion of like um I have a self and I'm either similar or different to other kids in some way when I was young I was put in a lot of advanced classes and not that that felt like a badge of honor it felt more like I was just classified as a nerd but then I thought okay well that's my strength so I'll lean into that and I thought that maybe I would be a teacher because I thought well I I get all these Concepts and I think I could relate them to kids or to my peers because I helped a lot of my classmates through some of some classes so that's all I really had I didn't know and then when I would play sports I would I would be okay you know I wasn't I wasn't terrible but I wasn't the VIP or the MVP and so I was just kind of playing basketball playing uh baseball um and then when I found skateboarding I mean it was it was pretty obvious that that was what I wanted to do it was once once I got on a skateboard and realized that I could maneuver it and do things that were unique and now they're moving the needle or anyone cared but they were unique in the sense of like I didn't I've never seen anyone do this and this feels awesome and so I just want to do this and so I didn't think that this is my career I was 10. so I just thought this is this is my phone this is my hobby this is this is my thing um and I don't want to play these other sports anymore did you stop playing all the others yes I I quit I quit little league in the middle of the season when my dad had been appointed president of that chapter of Little League because he was the coach he was always very involved in all of his kids I have three siblings so he was always very supportive whatever they were doing and then when I was playing baseball he became a coach because he had time and he was doing that he was he was you know almost retired um and then he was such a prominent figure in the Little League they said oh you're president now and so then someone else was coach and then I was skating and I was over it did you immediately start skateboarding "

            "text": "in the parks on transition as we say or were you pushing around in the driveway like most kids it was I was transportation and skating was kind of a fad so I started in 78 roughly maybe 77 even and it was kind of a fad so kids just had skateboards and they would they would all cruise around you know like it was the 70s so everyone had a bike right and you knew wherever all the kids were because the bikes were in the front lawn and then at some point that kind of turned into skating so everyone had skateboards they're all like shitty you know uh JCPenney or Big Box store skateboards no one had really good ones not in my area um but then at some point we were just looking at these magazines of people skating and everyone's skating in pools because that was the Dogtown and Z-Boys era and it was like these guys are flying I wanna like where do we do that and then the skate park opened up in San Diego that was Del Mar's Cooper uh okay Oasis Oasis skatepark was the first one in our area actually I take that back Spring Valley was the first skate park I tried to go there and I was nine and you had to be 10. and I remember like sitting in the parking lot looking over the fence and my dad didn't realize what they ate because my dad would have easily lied for me but he didn't realize there was an age limit and he said how old is he nine oh sorry he can't come and then they closed not long after so when I never got to Spring Valley um because I I think of you as synonymous with Del Mar skate Ranch sure well that was that came later because Oasis skate park was opened up so this was when I first went was like 78. uh a friend of mine was going and he said I want to go to the skate park so I had to go get you know this is such a hassle like I had to go get the authorization form I had to get it notarized by the bank for my parents like to go there and then I went and it was that was my Epiphany when I first saw people flying around in person I was like this is what I'm doing for as long as I could possibly do it because it looked it looked like magic it really did it looked like they were flying on magic carpets and and it spoke to me in the sense of being a daredevil but also doing it individually not relying on my team not um getting hassled by a coach it was just like oh I can be part of the scene but do it my own way and then uh I skated Oasis as much as I could whenever I get your rides there and um then my parents moved to North County San Diego when I was in high school um mostly because they were just chasing kind of real estate deals and uh and so I got lucky that Dome our skate Ranch was right there every other Park closed but Del Mar skate Ranch remained open so I mean there was a bit of luck to all that and it was based on geography your dad's involvement is interesting because I got into skateboarding because you know my dad wasn't around that much at that time a lot of kids getting skateboarding because it doesn't require parent involvement was it unusual to have parental involvement at that stage yeah I mean I remember Frank and by the way I remember Frank and Nancy your parents with was with such fondness not just because they took me in but I remember thinking like there they were at times the only point of stability in a landscape of like 200 people where as you know there could be potential chaos of any kind and your dad had this way of moving about like he wasn't afraid I recall that he wasn't afraid to say what he thought like hey don't do that like impose some regulation at this contest and at the same time it seemed me also understood that this was a sport unlike other sports like you're not gonna regulate kids like me at the time or you're not going to try and control people so what was it like to have your dad involved and the reason I ask is that you're a parent we'll talk more about parenting but also it seems that he went from saying okay you know little league other sports which is more typical to okay this kind of unusual sport skateboarding but your mere interest in it was enough to get him excited or motivated enough to take you around to these places um that's pretty special I mean that's pretty it was I mean and in that respect it was great to have his support and and to rely on him for that the fact that he was always around and he was in charge of a lot of the events that that sucked because because it just marked me um as one being favorited um and spoiled um and and most of my friends their parents didn't want them skating so even though they were stoked that my dad had was was doing this kind of thing and giving that kind of support they still were like your Dad's here like this is our thing this is our scene this is our getaway from our parents well I I didn't really have a choice in the matter I did I did at some point tell him my my concerns and my frustrations with it but he didn't really want to hear it you know he was he was very much steadfast like well I'm I'm been coming this far like you can we can keep our distance at these events but people are relying on me to organize them and so I just had to suck it up for a while did it push you harder like you know if you could prove yourself with a skateboarding that you didn't have to worry about any claims of favoritism because ultimately you can't fake you can't fake Escape right right I mean there's no deep fake version of skateboarding you know you either can do it or you can't do it and it's shown in real time so um and I suppose back then I recall you "

            "text": "were quite a bit skinny or skinnier oh yeah I had I had all kinds of things going against me at the time yeah I mean I don't think people will realize this unless they've met you in person but nowadays there are a few taller skateboarders out there because the Sports grown so much um but you're pretty tall you're like six six three but okay I was not when I was growing when I was that age I was very small um and kind of concerningly small Because by the time I got to be 16 I was still I looked like I was 13. I used to get pulled over I literally like I had a car that I bought with my earnings I had a Honda Civic 1977 cvcc and I would get pulled over and then the cops would be like how old are you again 16. like well you look like you were 13 back there um and then I shot up around age 17. okay so that's interesting and we can get back to this when we talk about your almost remarkable levels of ability to recover from physical injuries because um well I'll just share a little bit of a biological Theory here which is that you know there are a lot of people that study longevity and perhaps the fastest rate of Aging that we ever undergo is puberty right if you think about a kid before puberty kid after abuse different human being psychologically often physically as well some people have a longer Arc of puberty than others and that does seem to correlate with a longer life and so it's kind of interesting you know some kids hit puberty and they go through all the markers of puberty in like one summer right other kids it's very very long and it sounds like we don't have to talk about when you hit puberty and the other markers but it sounds like your growth spurt occurred late oh yeah that's a terrific marker of a long life by the way because what it reflects is the onset of a big burst of growth hormone out of the pituitary in the brain and if you continue to grow for a long period of time that indicates you know it gives you a little bit of the slope of the line does that make sense oh yeah so um this this may um have important and fortunate consequences so at 17 you shot up am I correct in Remembering uh maybe you said it maybe somebody else did that you were um forgive me but so skinny when you were a kid that you actually wore elbow pads as knee pads yeah yeah that's a true that's a true story for sure and and I took inspiration from others that that I identified with namely Steve Caballero because he was already an established Pro when I started to come up in the ranks or even get noticed at all and he was wearing elbow pads on his knees in this full-page picture of him and Winchester doing a back sitter and I was like that I want to do that and he's small and I feel like that's my goal yeah like if he can do that I can do it it was just more like oh this I identify with that and and that gives me hope um and as I recall Stevie also has a pretty severe scoliosis right like at one point Julius what he has at one point he was turned turned pretty pretty tight to the to the right or left I don't recall which I mean still incredible skateboarder loves TV he's a NorCal guy so yeah I grew up I know whatever he had is from birth but um but it was more that his size and I didn't even know he was he many not many but you know he's like four years older than me um so I just was like oh there's small guys doing that I can do it maybe but when I got tall when I went through puberty suddenly I had all these tricks and then suddenly I had the strength and the the height that gave me confidence and so all of a sudden it was like oh I can go way higher now and I'm comfortable with these tricks these intricate board Maneuvers and stuff so that was a huge advantage to me um the the smaller Stuff felt different after that which was harder um but being able to blast AFI in the air as opposed to four feet in the air was a huge Advantage yeah isn't that wild when the nervous system knows how to do something and then your body changes and you can do the same thing but with so much more Force even the bowls look smaller when I would stand on top I was like wait this isn't that big it's wild well the reason I ask about this I think you know people listening generally seem to assume that you know if you become a Stanford Professor or become a professional skateboarder or you a professional soccer player that that you were just fated to become that right and it's clear that it's the Confluence of so many different factors um but one of the consistent factors for sure is a sense that you just really love doing it right I mean I can't imagine getting you know proficient or excellent at anything without loving doing it right and so still at this time when you were let's say um 14 15 um did you have any concept of you know whatever pro model I'm gonna none of that well there was there was none of that to be had so we didn't have these great aspirations because no one had really done that before there were you could have some success yes you could have maybe a signature model but even the top sales of skateboarding then wasn't a career the prize money was 150 for first place 100 for second 50 for third couple tanks of gas some food yeah so let's put it this way I turned Pro when I was 14. by the time I was 15 and a half and I had a learner's permit and I could drive a scooter you know I had 600 in my bank account and I used that to buy a Honda Express uh moped for a year and a half that was my earnings was six hundred dollars so clearly money wasn't the uh the dopamine hit it was the it was the actual skateboard sure and that's what I mean though there wasn't there was no goal of that because it just didn't exist so I didn't care like getting I I have my own vehicle at age 15 like I was living large I can get to the skate park on my own that was amazing to be 14 and be a professional at anything must "

            "text": "be um a trip so to speak um but what I'm wondering about because I came up when um your early cohort with Paul Peralta so for those that don't know so-called Bones Brigade right I guess it was a total what like six seven guys there were someone that were a little more peripheral than others um they're about six seven core guys um in the various videos I mean you guys were famous right you had posters um on kids walls who skateboarded there was a second or maybe it was a third surge of popularity and skateboarding um because it would sort of surge in general popularity than disappear and come back as it has over decades it keeps coming and going um to some extent did you have a conscious awareness of just how you know how much attention was being placed on you know photos of you videos of you and I'm just wondering about the younger version of you whether or not you know you realize what was happening and the reason I ask is because you've always seemed to me somebody who through interviews through videos through our interactions and for those who have known you much longer than I have um just very grounded like not caught up in it um you know we've never seen headlines about you kind of just you know blowing all your money or you know wrecking cars and you know destroying your life I mean I'm sure you've made mistakes like any of us but but you seem to have avoided a lot of the pitfalls of quote unquote famous people and celebrities and yet you were a famous person from a very young age I well I think it was that I didn't never I never that was never a goal and then when I had a sense of it I was very uncomfortable I mean I was happy I was happy to be successful I was happy that people recognized me that that was amazing just because I was good at skateboarding I never imagined something like that um and but I was always very I mean some people thought that I was sort of almost like pompous or arrogant because I wasn't interacting because I was just I was walled up I was like I don't know what to do I don't know this is the last words I would ever use to describe you I think it was just more that that that people would see me like I go to a ramp I didn't know anybody and I would just start skating and I'd do all my stuff and they were like oh he doesn't even talk to anyone and I was like I don't know I don't know what to do I don't know how to act also you were 14 years old so Stacy broke me out of that because I remember one time there was a kid that was just staring at me like hold my skateboard he had my signature model and he said go say hi to that guy what are you sure like he wants he wants to interact with you you know just go high five of them or anything and and I learned to sort of break out of my comfort zone by doing that enough um but my first go around I mean that was that was sort of my first uh wave of Fame I'd say the Bones Brigade years and we are so young that we thought this is forever and so we were definitely careless with our our money with our actions and um and at some point my dad saw that he didn't think it was going to be long term because no one had had a long-term career right so he he uh encouraged me to to invest to get property like to buy a house that was the that was my Saving Grace because I definitely was spending on cars and things like that uh yeah car like kind of a little bit beyond my means I wasn't really considering all my money was was 10.99 income so it wasn't we weren't paying taxes on anything and at the end of the year it would be like oh you owe this much like wait what are you talking about so um for instance hey do you want to go to Hawaii yeah okay invite everyone we're all going to Hawaii I got well let's rent a place okay you know and it was on me because I had the means you mentioned Stacy we should probably clarify for people um Tony's referring to the great Stacy Peralta yeah he was he was the one who put me on the Bones Brigade when I was still considered sort of a circus act like a you know my my skating was not really established the stuff that I was doing was largely made fun of because people thought that what I was doing was just more like a free show can you explain more so my and let me just tell you that my recollection first recollection of you that I still have that image in my mind would um is the finger flip error right you know so for folks that aren't familiar with skateboarding you know people ride around on transition or in the street handrails stairs you know people probably familiar with all those things but um skateboards will Riot up toward the top of the pool of the ramp and they'll do something on the so-called lip or the coping that's to ride at the the edge of it or they'll go above it like in the air but I recall seeing you do the finger flip error I've never seen anyone flip a board in the air I've seen people do varial so right move it it's going to be complicated for people just listening but just flip it upside down and then catch it in and finger flip error yeah that was I remember that was a jaw drop right it was like so if that was considered circus era or circus uh like then I don't know I don't know what it was being compared to because at the time we we probably watched that it was in slow motion as I recall and we probably watched it three thousand times you know that summer there's a big group of us that all starts skateboarding that summer um I would say kind of just before that in that window is when people were were more um giving me Flack for what I was doing because I was mostly doing board variation stuff but I still didn't have the height the height in terms of the height in terms of in terms of getting in the air yeah so I was doing all this stuff kind of right at coping level and so people weren't taking it into consideration or giving it much Merit because it was just like oh he's doing a little board twist or a bar turn and then when I started to get some height around the time you saw and started doing those tricks like visibly way up high that's when the the the shift happened in terms of more acceptance but I was still labeled as a as like a trick skater robot skater and then you had Christian osoy who was all Style air is higher than anyone anytime he did a trick it was going to be so flashy and so amazing and Rockstar personality and Rockstar personality and so in that era you I mean it was very divided it was like no one liked us both you know what I mean it was just so strange to be of that age and of doing something that had never really been established and then suddenly I'm pitted against another skater and we're just trying to make our way through 15 years and and skateboarding and and um it got it was it was hard I mean it was like I got I got bullied you know yes I was successful yes I was you but but I would get I would get uh Thrasher magazine would talk about my performance when I would win yeah I remember that because I was from Northern California and Thrasher magazine was a Skateboard Magazine from Northern California actually wrote for them for a while when I was a postdoc to make some extra money uh under a different name folks but you can try and find those articles they're out there um and then in Southern California it was skateboarder mag Transworld mostly Transworld skateboarding yeah it was a trans World transport skateboarding and Thrasher magazine were there were the two the rivals right yeah um so yeah I recall um some of those things that were said um it just is amazing to me um but it brings about a really important lesson which is you know that kid that gets made fun of if they're determined and they love what they're doing that's going to be the kid that blows everyone away later and I know this for sure because I'll never forget there do you remember the back to the city contest that were called in San Francisco so I went to those they were in the drain fountains in front of City Hall I remember getting there one day and there was this guy with kind of like afro-like hair pushing around he was doing what are called daffies he had two skateboards he was kind of like weaving around and I remember thinking you know San Francisco's other its issues now but back then it was rough also for different reasons I remember thinking like this guy is going to get beat up I hung out with the Embarcadero crew I was like this guy's gonna get beat down yeah that guy was Mark Gonzalez oh yeah so one of the greatest perhaps the greatest Street skateboarder if you can't really Define these things greatest and whatnot in skateboarding um but you know I remember thinking this guy's just he's a kook and then I realized who it was and then I realized he was just like any other kid there at some level and then a lot of the kids that got teased early on they stuck with it five years later I'm singing them in the magazines and I think about this with podcasting too there have been some podcasters they've reached out early on and had questions and you know look at their stuff and you know one's initial impression can be like what are they like what are they doing here and then you just see them two years later three years later and they're doing amazingly well and you're like this guy or gal is here for good they're gonna they're probably gonna be top of the game in a few years so you never count anybody out when you would go to sleep at night in that era were you like laying on the pillow going like oh my God people hate me there's stuff in the magazines I gotta push harder this is hard did you talk to your dad about it I mean again it's a lot to Bear even as an adult I can only imagine what it's like to bear as a 15 year old kid I didn't really have a support group you know or any resource to to voice those concerns um I just knew I wanted to keep getting better that was it and so if anything if I was worried about those voices if I was worried about the whatever take people had on me I knew I was going to go back to the skate park and learn more tricks um and at some point I had so much of that as a foundation that it was sort of undeniable that like well he can do all this stuff and he doesn't just do it at his home park um and I think that's probably when the tide turned for me is when when I started to do well at other events um namely Upland pipeline which was for the most part the most frightening pool that we could ride the thing was big but I also recall like the the hips as they're called like the transitions the way they match up super tight a lot of her giant coping super rough like if you fell in Upland you're getting shoot up it's pulling your knee pads down but I didn't know that because from the photos I wouldn't know that oh it was it was treacherous it really was like it was and and I wanted to do well at the event and I would drive up there every weekend like my friend uh Greg Smith was a freestyler but he lived near Upland and so I would go drive Friday after school straight to Upland skate at night skate Saturday all day skate Sunday uh early and then drive home um because I live in San Diego and I just made it my mission to to figure that thing out because that was The Proving Ground for me um Emma and so if I could skate that I could go get anything as many of you know I've been taking ag1 "

            "text": "let's talk a little bit about the process of trying tricks and the English anxiety associated with it did you did you and do you have a sort of systematic process was it you know I'm going to learn the basics first like did you say that do you say I'm okay I'm going to learn how to do stuff you know at coping level then I'm gonna do a little error then I'm gonna go bigger I'm gonna do this or um did you just sort of um try what you wanted to try and you obviously weren't haphazard about it like how it seems you're pretty systematic about exploring what's possible and then pushing forward little by little but um yeah maybe you could talk a little bit about how you have conceptualized okay tomorrow I want to try this um it comes in different forms but for the most part I think about how I could combine existing tricks and would this trick work going into this trick and could your body position shift or would it all work in unison and when I approach a new trick I'm saying I'm saying more in the last 20 years my thought process is I have all the pieces to this I've done every bit of it I've done that I've done the first part of the trick in another form I've done the second part or the grinding of it or whatever usually in some other basic way and then the landing is well the landing is from whatever that is and if you can throw all those things together and make the timing work it's gonna work and I I never I never went at something with some Hazard approach or throwing caution to the wind like hope this see what happens it's always very much like I know I have all these things and so I just have to put them together and I mean now things are so technical that my same approach that I'm doing hundreds of times one of them just works and it's not because I didn't it's not because I committed to that one it's because of some tiny fractional adjustment that happened that I didn't even know happen and it just worked and I mean that kind of is the curse of what tricks are now because there are plenty of moves that I've done over the last 10 years even that I I only did once because it was too hard to get to and I didn't learn from that one make and that that is that's hard to accept because in the past I was learning tricks to have them in my Arsenal that I could just throw them down at a competition or a demo I've got that in my pocket these days like that trick for instance I did a I did a 360 shove it five out of fakie all right let's let's break that down for real 360 shove it so who's gonna take this on I'll let you take this on I can try it from my knowledge and perspective but whatever 360 shove it is pushing the board with your feet and letting it spin a full 360 rotation under your feet in the landing back on it it's it's a trick that people do on usually on flat ground I've learned I've learned to do it up on the vert walls like I could do 360 shove its kind of in the air but I'm doing that I'm doing a 360 job and then I'm landing on my truck right like the axle Between the Wheels on one axle in a what we call a 5-0 position which is basically a wheelie on the truck so everything is so precise I got to do 367 at exactly a certain spot on the wall I've got to catch it so that my truck lands when my foot hits it I can't push it into the truck because that that screws up my balance so it has to land on the truck I have to land with my weight perfectly set back enough that I can come in backwards because I'm doing this trick and and I'm I'm gonna come in fakie right 360 show 50 to coming in forward is is a whole different Beast that that I could probably do that just in a few tries but the idea that I have to land on this thing balance on it like a teeter-totter and then reverse my energy and come in fakie backwards it's so hard it's so hard to to get into the right position so like any time I try it there's like a one in ten chance I'm even gonna get into the position I need and that's the one I have to commit to so every time I do it it's so intense and it takes so much so much commitment and so much mind I don't even know how to explain it like the the that you have shut everything else out except this one moment and this one fractional piece that you have to make work and it I've done it once and I like I would love to do it again but I know what it's gonna it's gonna take the same amount of effort I didn't learn from that one that I made some trick that makes it happen every time it's all so Technical and there's so many things that can go wrong that all is accepted okay I did it once in thinking about the 360 show at 50 "

I know I could do that with with my current state and not getting that much speed so to explain what I was doing is is a half cab body rail to Backside blunt okay we can walk through this half cab has come up backwards come with 360. right so half an hour ago as I approach the top of the ramp I body rail that means I jump around and then I jump around on my board and then I make sure that it lands with my two trucks out and my tail on the coping which is very precarious and I've done that and come in fakey beef that's the blunt piece that's the blunt so I've done that right where you and then you have to you have to use your B to lift up the board come in fakie right I've done that I've done that twice and I thought well I wonder if there's something I could do like that and then I realized that if I just keep coming around and I come in backside direction that keeps my body spinning and that might actually be easier it wasn't but I figured it out I think I saw a clip of this honest I did it yeah I mean I did it I did it X Games and I was like it was my last run I was it was I mean it didn't move the needle I got seven plays but for me it was a huge moment it felt amazing I bet oh yeah for sure I mean and it was I mean it was like weeks of preparation and trying to figure this thing out I made it twice before the event um on my own alone on my ramp but um that's just an example of of you know I was I was literally falling asleep and then all of a sudden I was like half cup body well back to blunt I love it that liminal State between wakefulness and sleep is such a beautiful state that if one is open to ideas showing up there yeah they almost always do I try to start trying it the next morning do you ever find that when you're taking walks or in the shower or not thinking about skateboarding yeah it's usually in the in the sort of mundane moments that that I get inspiration yeah do you have practices for Pure relaxation aside from socialization I know I was never I think that's something I've been lacking I I never was good at warming up stretching post-warm up um or or or relaxing you know meditation nothing I just I I go skate and it's on um and as I've gotten older I realize that's not the best technique but it's worked so far it has worked um so for you it's Go Hopefully a little bit of warm up if you I have more of a sort of OCD warm-up run that I use to gauge how I'm feeling but I kind of have to get through that like a surgeon when a surgeon's about to do a surgery um they don't warm up they just check off the various boxes of you know this is here that's there make sure that they're comfortable in their environment and then they do they do the life-saving work yeah yeah I'd say my warm-up run is is kind of basic tricks but they give me a sense of how how stiff or how I what I need to adjust for it for the rest of the day so I guess it's not so OCD but it but I definitely feel like I gotta go through that routine what feels the best like I I know that "

I'm not gonna make the same mistake I did last time where I tried it low thinking I just get away with it anymore so the going high was more of a safety measure which is ironic the the bigger the ramps for me the safer it is because I have a better Landing Zoom I have more time in the air to adjust and even though it looks spectacular and Music Experience it's just like no I need that I can't skate some eight foot pool I have no Landing zone I'm Too Tall I'm too I move too slowly now to do that kind of stuff so that's why you don't see me like in the Park events and stuff like that you know you're going to see me on this 14-foot boat ramp because that's my happy place and that's where I'm safe um but also having my wife there I just knew I wasn't gonna get hurt in front of her because I would have been such trouble the the emotional support and pressure is uh is a real thing and in the best ways uh not to focus on the bad aspects of the injury because there are planning yeah that I recall you and I communicated not long after the let's say let's call it what it was the first break and I remember you said to me over text you said how long before I'm skateboarding again and I said um skateboarding as in pushing or skateboarding as in um what you do on vert you know and you said uh what I do on vert and I said well it seems you are doing a lot of things you were doing deliberate cold delivery heat pressure you do a number of things I mean you're not haphazard about your career and your body and your health we'll get into that a little bit later some of the things that you've enjoyed as beneficial for you but um you said I'm calling it at two months and I said okay um I believe it and then I recall that you was it the Oscars or some other award event where you came out about a week later you came out there uh you walked out this broken femur and you weren't using any support to walk out so you clearly ditched whatever support you might have been using uh which I think is Awesome by the way um and then pretty soon I was seeing videos of you dropping in I'm seeing videos of you doing kick turns below coping I'm seeing videos of you at coping and you know we have a friend in common the skateboard and generally photographer Mike blaback and I remember texting Mike I was like Tony's back already this is this is superhuman rates of healing and I think it is super human rates of healing then you mentioned that you damaged broke broke the femur again so "

            "text": "did you allow more rest the second time what was driving you to get back in it so quickly the first go-around I just didn't listen to any of the professional advice because I thought well I've done I've come this far and I've always been able to push through broken pelvis broken elbow um knee surgeries and I've always been the timeline is always very shortened for me because I just get back out there and I and I get the healing started but I also am comfortable with what people think is extremely risky but in this instance I want to get back out there right away and not long after the Academy Awards uh I was actually walking with a cane at that time and I ditched the cane just to walk out on stage to present the award so that was my big my big coming out moment but it was kind of forced and as soon as I walked out to stay they grabbed my cane and I was hobbling in the backstage um but I was I was skating kind of a mini ramp and and I was already struggling because I couldn't put my weight on my front foot because my bones still had not connected to itself so there's a gap in the bone but there's a there's a nail what they call a nail or you know big piece of metal that's holding them in place but I didn't realize how careful I needed to be with that because it was so precarious and I decided I'm going to drop in on the mini ram like I think I'm ready and and it wasn't the drop in on the main ramp it was me getting to the top of the mini ramp and stepping off my board that's always that kind of stuff but but I just stepped off my board like I would do any other day but I didn't think I led with my front foot and I felt the bone move in that moment I I really I felt it I felt it either twist or get out of place and I was in total denial for months because I just said oh I just it just hurts now like I you know I I got a minor setback and then I finally eight months into my recovery seven months into my recovery I was always in pain my skating wasn't progressing I couldn't get speed and by all measures I should be back at least I'd be back to a level that I feel good about and I went and got x-rays and they said your bone never connected you have a non-union fracture and and and and every time I skated so my bones like this every time I skated I was pushing it further away and so my bone was like this on the last X-ray and and that was the hard truth so for those listening just laterally displaced think about a pipe that's broken in the middle and just one's offset to the other and and as I keep skating and I I could force my skin like I kind of learned this hack where I can put 75 of my weight on my back foot and 25 of my front foot and do what I wanted to do but it wasn't where I thought I'd be and it just hurt all the time I mean it really was like that was my trigger because I I have a pretty high tolerance to pain and it was always her like I I would dread going to the airport knowing I had to walk to a gate so I knew something was wrong there I went to a specialist um that deals in non-union fractures and he had a very pragmatic factual approach and it was like oh I would do this I'm taking that nail out and take the other Hardware out and put it together and you cannot move for two months did you obey that at work I did really yeah so what what is chilling I was not going to risk that again did you um and do you prioritize things like sleep um nutrition um just you know generally and did you emphasize those things while you were recovering from the injury yeah I I was very disciplined in my diet in my schedule and my sleep um surprisingly I I was very busy because um I do speaking engagements and suddenly my speaking engagements were getting booked left and right I mean to the point where I did a tour through Europe Last Summer of speaking engagement so that was that was a silver lining I guess to my my idle time um and I leaned into it you know I made myself available and and uh it you know it's good money and it was it's fun to to interact and um but all through all through that of course in the back of my head I was like when when can I skate when can I skate and then when I finally started skating it was night and day with my leg I felt like I could lean forward suddenly I was learning tricks every every session relearning tricks um so I just I'm just lucky that I got to live in this time of modern medicine was that two months the longest you've ever gone without skateboarding vert yeah yeah without skating at all not even just pushing around yeah good for you for obeying doctor's orders and also finally and also good for you for deciding that your rate of recovery is going to be whatever it is for you because I feel like I'm hearing both things on the one hand you listen to the medical professionals on the other hand I'm not hearing oh you know I looked at the average rate of recovery from this kind of fracture this and that it's it's like it's as if you decided two things at once that there are experts who have something to offer me here I'll follow their advice and yet I'm the expert at myself here I'm putting myself in your first person uh Tony's the expert in Tony and I'm going to make sure that I come back 100 yeah or better yeah not better but um and I've and I have come to terms with that because I know that I'm not going to be pushing myself the way that I did before I got hurt anymore there are some tricks now that are way more difficult just because whatever something changed in my body and for instance I can't grab slob like I can't I I can't do it consistently that used to be my go-to grab you could do that anytime over 60 foot gaps whatever like I could I just grab I knew where my board was I knew that was going to hold on to my feet and half the time I try to grab that way now I don't reach it or I grab my foot instead and I I don't know I can't make the adjustment to fix it and so I've just sort of come to terms with well that's not the go-to grab anymore and that's okay I had a good run yeah your kid's pretty pretty uh vast so there's a lot of other things to reach too aside from the 540 which by the way congratulations not only is it a 540 but uh done at least head high I've seen it with my own eyes and um and under really great circumstances your wife there just the two of you and after and the trick that broke the femur in the first place yeah so um congratulations on that thank you I'd like to take a quick break and acknowledge our sponsor inside tracker "

it's so invert like it's one-handed handstand um I can do them now but I've seen you do them recently yeah but but I used they used to be my signature it was a tucking Amber and flopped all the way back and and I can't get a hold of my board to pull it all the way back like I used to um if I can get that I'll feel like that's it that's that's that was the last Milestone I'm not here to uh diagnose and treat these uh specific uh skateboard trick isms but between your what you said about the slob air and what you're saying about this seems like they're same thing about about getting your your your front hand around and around pulling it back back in uh behind you so maybe this is like the way that the femur is lining up with your pelvis and maybe some off-ramp something or other Physical Therapy could do I'm actually working with um at best core he is a he is a doctor of physical therapy and he has helped me immensely through my recovery and when I'm frustrated with this motion or that's the same grab actually as in the twist he worked on me before it and was just contorting my body and my leg into these positions that I don't really even get to when I'm skating just to prepare me for that and he did but that's what it took it's interesting that we're talking about skateboarding and we're also talking about physical therapists we're talking about nutrition we're talking about sleep so growing up means like none of that none of that never imagined any of this and I'm chuckling because you know growing up in skateboarding um early on for me uh not quite as early as you but pretty early 12 um and got out of it and back and yes I can still do a thing or two uh here and there um but that's not the point the point is that you know the nutrition consisted largely of you know fast food or whatever was around cigarettes and beer were sort of the the energy drinks and uh uh and um supplements of of the times this is fortunately changed but there there was essentially no Health promoting tools or aspects to it at all but that was back then but then over time it seems It's evolved like now I see um I saw a couple posts from Stevie Williams like he's in the gym sure um I think I saw Danny Way early on working with Paul check and doing some balance work neck work because he had broken his neck surfing and things of that sort so there seems to have been a big shift over the last 15 20 years where skateboarders are taking good care of their bodies like other athletes thinking about the resilience of their bodies and also generally taking better care like a lot of them opt not to drink and do drugs and all those sorts of things so I mean how does it strike you to see the way that skateboarding has evolved towards the option to be much healthier and treat it like a like a serious sport where you're a serious athlete a word that you know even 15 years ago 20 years ago if you called a skip order an athlete some people might even be offended by oh yeah people in skateboarding right absolutely yeah um well to answer your question in the early days that was part of the the scene and the culture just because the the it was the antithesis to organize team sports and mainstream culture and so it was just like yeah this is what we do it who cares like we drank and we skate and everyone it was it was Wild West right but as I never fell into that deeply because I saw how it affected people's performances and the skating itself was Paramount to me that is what I want to focus on that's what I want to be good at and I saw people partying and partying their skills away so I had at least that forethought um and then as scanning got more established popular more of a career option than people started taking it more seriously especially competitors I mean and and but there's such a wide swath of of what skateboarding is and it's a big tent so to say that it's more organized yes it's more organized over here there's still all these skaters over here partying hopping fences don't care about contests don't want sponsors oh like GX 1000 like those kids at bomb Hills in San Francisco like like but that that's what I love about it is the diversity of it all and that that's we're all part of this scene so I I was a competitor that was that was my path to success and so I appreciate that people take it more seriously now and that they do have trainer they have resources I mean they have sponsors that will pay for this kind of stuff there was no such thing I mean like at our biggest skate contest we were all staying at Stacy Peralta's parents house the night before and he would take us out to get spaghetti because he thought carbohydrates was going to give us energy the next day that was the extent of training in 1983. right but nowadays it we're treated like High Elite athletes because they are like if you really look at people that are at the top of their field people like Niger Houston you know what I mean like the dude is a machine he is he is one of the most precise skaters that we've ever seen or precise athletes this side of Nadia coming each you know yes I'm I'm I'm aging myself but what I'm saying is like this is this is takes hardcore dedication Precision athleticism and devotion and so now they have the resources to back that up and to keep it going longer I mean yeah would I be able to do this now especially after getting hurt without the help of a doctor of physical training probably not I'd do it on some level but I wouldn't get to where I am now um and so hey I think it's awesome I you know I I never I never wanted to covet skateboarding as this thing that no one else could like a gatekeeper to it no one else can touch it I always thought there was something to skateboarding that was magical and that was good for mental health and that was that was required such um required such passion and I didn't I never understood why I didn't get bigger through those those leaning years it was always like kids this speaks to kids like it's Daredevil and it's active and it's exciting and you can do it as a group but you can do it your own way and I don't know all those things it took a long time for everyone else to figure it out they definitely figured it out I mean nowadays skaters are the cool kids in school yeah it's in the Olympics like there was always discussion would it be it was an exhibition sport in the Olympics at one point no uh no no oh I thought it was it for maybe it had a run it potentially being an exhibition there were there was talk about it got it um but it never did and and not that I mean at some point especially in the late 90s or 2000s skating was getting appreciated and and kind of reached that threshold of of is it mainstream well it's in it's all McDonald's commercials so I guess that's pretty mainstream and so we already had come of age and it was like we don't need the Olympics we're already more popular than a lot of Olympic sports right so why do we need their validation and then at some point it became like the the power Dynamic shifted and it was like oh they need our cool Factor we don't need their validation and I was like yeah okay you guys want it sure go ahead but hold the events hold the qualifiers we'll participate but we don't need this well you've been an amazing Ambassador for the sport that's driven so much of "

            "text": "that wider acceptance and progression and invitation into different domains one of the um things that I definitely want to talk about is the video game right because I think that the video game changed a lot of things for the general public in terms of their perception of skateboarding I mean what it allowed of course is this is obvious but it allowed kids that weren't going to you know um bang up their shins or walk in with a broken wrist or you know all skinned up too to do incredible tricks but in silico on a screen right and to and pretend that they are the the pro skateboarder that's essentially what what video games are about And yet when you can see something just like you can imagine it in a dream or while you're falling asleep and you can see something and and hear an air quotes do something in a video game it also is going to inspire a number of kids to go outside and grab a real skateboard and try that or try something like that so clearly the video game was a catalyst for what I consider now the the wide acceptance of skateboarding as a sport in all its various forms um could you just talk for a little bit about the Genesis of the video game were you into video games prior to the video game um were you into technology generally and and what sort of motivated the interest in the video game because it certainly has changed the face of actual skateboarding and the perception of skateboarding um well I've been into video games since the gecko I mean I was a kid you know playing pong Pac-Man Missile Command Qbert you name it and then getting the home systems in television Super NES Commodore 64. um Sega yeah but but I um and I always love technology so when I when I finally started making money in the 80s my first kind of big purchase in terms of that uh in in terms of electronics was uh Commodore Amiga which was considered one of the highest end uh home computers you know alongside Mac but but more graphic oriented and and more game-oriented um and so I was always into that idea that you could do this kind of stuff at home not just in arcades and then I gotta I got a call from a PC programmer that wanted to pitch a skate game and had a crude engine of um a skater that would cruise around go in bowls and stuff like that and it was all keyboard controlled it was clunky but it was something and the last thing that we had as skating was 720 in the arcade or a skate or die for home systems for Commodore 64. that was like the last thing that had happened for skateboarding um in video games and so I went with him I was excited to get like I got to we got to go to Nintendo and Pitch it um we went to Midway you know we went to all these different uh console and software manufacturers and were just told that this is a bad idea skateboarding is not popular home video games are barely a thing why would anyone want to buy a video game about skateboarding someone said those exact words to me um at Midway and so he got frustrated and he needed to find a job and I was I was just kind of free-floating so I said okay he goes well I'm gonna I'm not going to do this but I feel like you've established yourself at least in the Video Game World uh industry that you're interested in doing something so maybe if someone does something they'll call you and I was like yeah right sure sure enough like a year later Activision called me and they said hey we heard you want to do a video game I said well yes I would love to work on a video game I'm not a programmer or anything so we have something we're working on and we'd like to show it to you and so I went up to Activision um they were working on a skate game but it was based on an engine of a game that was already released called apocalypse starring Bruce Willis so the first version of my game was Bruce Willis on a skateboard with a gun shot to his back in a desert Wasteland doing kickflips and it was awesome it was it was truly like I picked it up and I got past that Visual and then I started playing it and and it was intuitive it the motion felt right the engine was right and I was like this is this is the Baseline of something special I didn't think it was going to be some big hit I just thought this is this is going to be appreciated by skateboarders and that was my goal the entire uh development process which was about a year and a half after I signed on we through that year and a half we were going back and forth with they would they would FedEx me builds on CDs I had a modified PlayStation and I would play it make notes and I thought man skater was going to dig this and that was it and skating wasn't even that popular it was coming to you know it was starting to get some traction what year was this again like 98 so it was like X Games were starting to come into the fold people were taking note of what skateboarding had become at that point and then I thought this is going to be cool skater's gonna like it and then um not long before the release they called me and they said hey we want to um we want to offer you a buyout of future royalties for this game um because I think you know there's I think people are going to like it I was like what does that mean they go we'll give you a half a million dollars and then you don't get royalties going forward but you get that money up front and at that time my life like to hear someone say half a million dollars seriously sounded like a half a billion dollars like no one had ever talked about numbers that big to me well also 98 was a little bit of a of a quiet time for verts skateboarding too right sure yeah but yeah for yeah luckily vert skating still was a thing because of inline skating because inline skating was huge right late 90s and they were all vert and so we as skaters got to sort of ride those coattails because it was like Hey There are boat ramps because everyone's rollerblading I forgot about that that did like and I have honestly like I was the special guest at a couple of inline rollerblade shows where it was like this is what team rollerblade live and special guest Tony Hawk the skateboarder and I was like hey all right dropping in but it paid the bills yeah um so to answer to like to to perform what you're saying bird skating was it was a thing at least established in the X Games which was something and enough for us to make a living um so when they offer me this money I actually was in a pretty good place um in terms of my I don't know my options my my trajectory and I felt like and I I had just bought a new home and I thought I'm gonna take a chance and to see what happens and like that was the best financial decision I ever met took the equity yeah I just let it ride I was like no I want to see what happens with this and as soon as the game was released it was getting Stellar reviews and then I remember like the very next week after it was released never stopped saying okay we're working on number two what do you want to do like what do you mean well yeah we're doing SQL which what awesome and then we ended up doing like 10. amazing crazy amazing I'm thinking about your decision to not take the cash and to see how it would go I'm thinking about your decision to buy "

            "text": "a car at 16 and yet as a consequence get pulled over because you look younger um I'm thinking about the time when through the graciousness of your parents who took me in because I had no money to get back up to Northern California and they couldn't get a hold of my mom um they took me to your home but then they took me to where you were living the next day which was in Fallbrook you don't remember this but I do and I know you've heard this story before so forgive me because most people listening haven't but I remember getting driven up to Fallbrook you had the ramps in your backyard I walked in got introduced to you you were very gracious said hello what's up I said feel free to push around on the ramps outside it was the mini it was a spine ramp yeah um two ramps back to back folks it's fine uh sorry nomenclature um I think Ray Underhill was there yeah he lived there for a while yeah and as I recall you had um pretty vast music collection and we'll talk about music um but it also seemed there was a couple cars in the driveway and whatnot but it's clear to me based on a number of things and that interaction and what I observed there that either you had someone in your ear either your dad or your mom or both or maybe it had been Stacy or maybe it was somebody else who was advising you to make very good financial decisions like not spend all your money or continue to spend all your money um to invest in things you know or maybe it was just instilled in you at a young age who knows I'm asking because I think so many people burn their early success you know what represents a lot of wealth for them early on they burn that where they start making just bad decisions you explained before why you tended to avoid drugs and alcohol and certainly um any severe relationship to drugs or alcohol that would keep you from progressing and skateboarding but you know the ability to make really good decisions as a young famous athlete is more rare than it is common even when people have coaches so I'm curious you know where did that um shrewdness and that Prudence come from and was Frank your dad and maybe Nancy also you know advising you all along like hey you know um think smart be smart because clearly you've made some some very smart decisions um he was definitely a guide in it he he was the first one who said you should probably buy real estate I was 17 so I didn't even know that was possible but he co-signed made it possible um but then after that I ended up buying that home that you went to and it was four acre property and we built these ramps on it and that was amazing and definitely helped Propel my skating to a different level than I ever imagined but at some point that was just a drain and it was a drain financially and I was living beyond my means and my income kept dropping because we're talking about not long after that was 91 92 the slowest days of skating and I've got this giant mortgage and I've got this property and these ramps that I can't afford to upkeep I can barely afford my water bill at one point you know and so what you saw might have seemed stable but behind the scenes it was it was starting to unravel birdhouse hadn't been started birdhouse was started in 92 and when I started birdhouse I took the equity from that house to start it because I didn't I burned through my savings from trying to keep this place going um so I took a second mortgage out on that house right I took my Equity out started birdhouse sold the house for what I had taken out and then moved to my original place that I had when I was in high school and just pulled back on expenses I think that was that was when I really became shrewd because I had to I had I had a first child I had an income that was very uncertain very fluctuating and I was just eating Taco Bell and Top Ramen and peanut butter jelly sandwiches and and not spending anything and and taking every job like the most random demo requests or we want you to be a consultant on this commercial because I'm too old I'm 24. I'm too old to be the guy skating because it has to be youth right but they're like well we want to see what's possible so can you come up the day before and show us the ropes and so I would be the stunt skater that's filling in to show them the Angles and stuff and then they would go higher Chet Thomas as the young kid and then I would stand around I was getting paid I didn't care I think I remember those commercials It Was a Serial commercial something like that uh the serial commercial was uh Chris Miller Frosted Flakes right and I was Tony the Tiger guys you chat uh yes um I throughout the birdhouse which is your company but without telling people what is a skateboard company I remember uh Willie Santos was early on I remember his super nice kid I used to see him at the contest I remember thinking well Tony Hawk has his own company for skateboarders we had a team you know like willy willy was a maestro um Jeremy Klein legendary Street Pioneer uh Steve Berra who's kind of a we called it ATV but Street and vert um we had uh ocean Howell it was like our number one amateur we had Andrew Reynolds Matt Beach um we had a team it was full on was it fun to move from Ryder to also Ryder but team manager owner was it fun it just it was just necessary I can't say it was fun I mean yeah it was it was fun because we were still just kind of Reckless and driving you know six of us in a van driving to skate shops across the country and begging them for 300 bucks so that we could get gas and food in the hotel room and get on our way um I don't know it just it but for me it just felt like a necessity to keep to to that was what I had to do to make a brand happen and so I was willing to do it um and but it was exhausting yeah because I had to be the had to be the the coach and the tour manager and the skater you know I was putting myself out there on like the worst conditions and just rolling my ankle left and right and it was and it was all Street and it was just wasn't my thing it was it was hard but I just I loved it it made it happen in my mind I'm thinking you had to be Tony Hawk the skateboarder Frank Hawk the organizer yeah and Stacy Peralta the yeah because Stacy had been a pro skateboarder I still think of him as a skateboarder yeah even though he's filmmaker right skateboard just like I still think of Spike Jones's skateboarder bmxer filmmaker um seems like you had to integrate all of those and I mentioned that because I am curious I think a lot of people are "

            "text": "probably curious like are you the type of person like sit back in a chair at night and think like okay like how I'm gonna do this I mean are you contemplative or is it really you just identify what needs to be done this year and over the next three years and you know set your Milestones kind of short in I guess so now we're back then back then oh no everything was just in the moment we got to get here we got to get to Dallas by tomorrow like as soon as this Demo's over getting the van we're going um we gotta get a hotel room you know it was just stuff like that it was it was very much but but I I respected I think I learned to respect um punctuality because I travel with playing at skaters that were not and didn't care and show up late and was like dude and like I don't know these guys and then when I was in charge it was like we're going to be on time because we have to respect other people's time and we said we're going to be here at three o'clock we're going to be there three o'clock um and that's not easy with a skate crew Mike blaback who as you know is it's a girl to the Hebrew and Lab podcast I talk about that we've got some other um guys that came over from DC to as filmers and editors for us and you know they're so punctual and they're so on it and I notice you showed up early today right right on timer early um early by five minutes um and that is a distinguishing factor I think in any occupation but especially in skateboarding where there's this kind of looseness sure and so if you do show up on time it really means a lot um the professionalism that you know was instilled in you it's it's clear that different places where that's showing up mentioned the shrewdness about the business decisions I'm curious about another aspect of that which is maybe a little more cryptic which is you know whether or not it was the CD collection that I saw or your mentioned of the car you're just in video games it seems that one thing that you've done that a lot of guys that I knew because back then by the way it was mostly guys now so we said they're women doing it too um women and girls it seems like you have a lot of other hobbies and interests music and Etc but that we never heard about you getting like distracted or pulled down those lines like we didn't hear about you going and surfing and getting hurt hurt surfing so that you couldn't skate we're getting really into motorcycles or race racing cars right you know um some people went hard left out of skateboarding into that like Ken Block the late great Ken Block but that became his main thing seems like you you knew that skateboarding was the main frame and stayed with that um and yet you have a lot of other interests yeah I think I I well with other sports especially like Motocross I I have this huge respect for Motocross I think it's super exciting I would love to do it and I know that I would not Escape unscathed like I would definitely want to learn the tricks do whips and flips and whatever and I'm gonna get hurt and I I don't want to risk my skate career for that so I I purposely pulled away from that type of thing um the last knee surgery I had is because I overshot a jump in Mammoth on my snowboard so that was a lesson I was like don't what are you doing just Cruise why yeah stay on the ground right hit the powder right you know free ride with your Bros because I learned my lesson and so so yeah you're right but at the same time like I still I still love going surfing and snowboarding I don't do them as much obviously um but but those are part of of what I did all growing up um and they're important to me um I did you know do a couple of celebrity car races like a NASCAR race and um I totaled a car in the Long Beach Grand Prix because this dude ramming to the wall and it was like well that was fun but I'm not I don't I don't have the bandwidth to get that serious about it and now you have a family of course too so of course yeah I mean and and those things as fun as they are and as as I don't know um as sort of auxiliary as as they are they require a lot of time I mean just for instance that Long Beach Grand Prix they want you to go stay in Palmdale for like a week and a half and train and and figure out how to truly know how to drive and be safe and it's like I don't know I ain't got time for that yeah that's time you're not skateboarding or with your family right yeah right now I feel the same way if I get pulled away from Reading papers and prepping podcasts and reading the latest research and thinking about experiments we could do then I for more than a couple of days I started feeling the itch I have a feeling this stuff is programmed into one's nervous system after a while like you've been skateboarding for so long that if you go a few days it probably just your system is is water or something oh yeah for sure I mean um well just for instance uh our ramp is uh being torn down on Sunday today is Friday our Ram is being turned on on Sunday at 10 A.M to be moved to Salt Lake City for our big bird event I'm going there at 8 30. so I can get a session before I can start down I love it on Father's Day that's my father's day I'm going to work at 8 30 a.m on Sunday I love it speaking of family and lineage uh tell "

daughter not so much anymore but all the boys five boys uh are all really into it um my oldest son is the most uh he's the most prominent because he turned Pro um and has I mean you know has his own following has a name for himself uh Riley and he's 30. yeah he kills it on Street he's a big street skateboarder he does yeah um but that you know they're they're all good they're all good skaters in their own ways and uh it's so fun I mean I I I didn't of course they're surrounded by it their whole life especially Riley because when he was young I I didn't really have the means to have child care whatever so I just said take him with me on tourism and whatnot so he was always around it so he got good at it by default but at some point started to shy away from him because he felt the pressure and My Shadow and it was like I don't this isn't fun I don't people expect me to be super good or I have to do this stuff and so he went shied away from it but then found a bunch of his friends in high school they love skating he's still good at us so he that he found his crew and they've all found their Crews uh completely independent of me and so when we go on vacation for instance we we were last year we were in uh or two years ago we were on the big on Hawaii they want to go to Ski parks I don't want to go to the skate parks I'm on vacation it's also a little harsh stuff it's a great way to get hurt right what's that over in Hawaii it's all weather worn oh yeah and it's not even my scene but but then so I go I'm I'm so I'm their chauffeur and I'm their Filmer I love it that's my vacation but but because they all love it so much you know what I mean and it just it's so cool like I mean how could I ever ask for more it's amazing let's talk about Frank and Nancy a little bit just because I have this kind of odd connection to your family through those uh it's really two or three day interaction changed my life forever meeting you was spectacular as a young skateboarding kid but also just the idea that someone would literally take me into their home I mean they had every reason to not trust me first of all I was hanging out with Billy Waldman no explanation needed the people who knew Billy I hope he's doing well I haven't heard anything about him but hope he's doing well um but we were wild but he basically took me into your home he and Nancy took me in um you know fed us um or fed me um I had another friend with me um and you know it I just have to say as you're describing your family I can only imagine what it must have been like for Frank and Nancy to see you have your kids did they get to um live long enough to see uh that Riley and your other kids were skateboarders my dad met Riley uh but my dad passed away when Riley was two so he's the only one of my kids that that he met yeah um my older sibling uh had kids so he met two of his other grandkids besides Riley um my mom got to see some of Riley's success but uh she suffered from Alzheimer's dementia and so things slipped away but um I I think that uh my dad would not believe that skateboarding is in the Olympics to him that's that is the top of the mountain because he was really into other sport he loved Sports he loved the Olympics he loves he loved watching football he loved watching baseball he loves when the Olympics were on he just he loved the competition element and the hype of it and and I think there was part of him that felt like why isn't skateboarding in this you know but he knew that there were so many hurdles to get through and so much more acceptance that needed to happen and I don't think he imagined would ever happen yeah he was a special guy I can still hear his voice he was a very large guy too I don't know if he I was just smaller then I definitely was smaller oh yeah no I mean he had like a big presence and um and I know I've told you this many times before this is actually how we got reconnected I sent you a direct message and said hey I met your parents in fact they took me into your home and I'm telling the truth and you'll know I'm telling the truth because they took me to dinner and they ordered black coffee after dinner and you know for years I would order black coffee after dinner you know as a kid you're just so impressionable these really nice people took me in I was like wow this is what a really healthy family looks like I'm grateful to have loving parents I always did but yeah I didn't have the healthy family structure so for me it was like oh my goodness these people drink black coffee after this must be what healthy families do so by the way folks don't drink caffeine within eight hours of going to sleep but um but I still do that but well you it doesn't seem to be holding you back um individualized but um yeah it's spectacular that this lineage of you know Frank to you and and I I mentioned and Nancy because it seems like while she might not have been at the contest and run around setting up tables and doing all that like she clearly was supportive as well oh oh she was I did a lot of the events too I mean they needed all hands on deck when it started getting big and no one was taking salaries you know that's the thing is that people thought like oh your dad's like cashing on he never took up money for any of that and he took so much you know what I mean he just he just loved it it was for you well it was for me and it was also for the Misfits that I surrounded myself with and even though he was he was Brash and he was like you know he was uh I don't know what's the word he was foreboding and intimidating and whatever else he did it for all those kids that were kind of lost like you I mean really like he he loved that it brought them together that he gave them a sense of self it gave them a sense of purpose he saw that because he he was that he he really had a rough childhood and he did everything he could through his adult life to make up for it with his own kids and with the kids that they surrounded themselves with so that's that's what he loved about it of course he loved seeing me Thrive too but he loved that he created the safe space and this this sense of community and so my mom my mom was that was her thing was getting people together gatherings you know oh we should all get together like even even my siblings and I as much as we want to emulate our parents we don't do it as much that as they did and we regret that well there's still time no we I mean we do but yeah um It's Tricky we're all different areas sure yeah the the person that comes to mind when I think about your dad I'm forgetting the movie but there's this one Clint Eastwood movie where he lives in a neighborhood where I think it's a bunch of young Hmong oh is that gangsters El Camino El Camino yeah and I just remember like there's that scene of like Clint coming out on his porch and just standing really upright yeah everything in his front his front lawn is everything's super manicured and just standing there like this immense presence and that's how I remember Frank Hawk yeah but he was a total softy that's the thing that's that's the you know there there was a it was it was all a front well he was certainly very precious like you you know you you got you got to see that side of him where it's just like oh yeah come on we'll we'll take you out you want to go see Tony's Place let's go like that's not some hard ass well there's a tail end of the story too where he actually called my mom and I think there may have been a statement or two about hey this kid's 14 like he can't be in Linda Vista Boys Club taking the bus back to Lancaster et cetera et cetera may have been some discussion like that but then they also paid for me to go home oh yeah they flew me home yeah so I think I owe you a couple hundred bucks for a Southwest flight or whatever Airline it was well it's it's fun and I think important to reminisce about these people because um they aren't just your parents but they've done so much and through you you know I I really think that um emotions and stories are really like the equivalent of energy in humans you know when people talk about energy because that gets carried forward um speaking of which we share a common love "

            "text": "skateboarding as a 14 year old and you know into my uh close to my 20s and then took some time off for sure um hardly any girls hardly any women there were a few like carabeth Burnside they got teased ridiculed it was hard on them super hard yeah super hard now largely through Instagram um but some other channels as well you can see this young girl Rhys onvert skateboarding better than a lot of grown men who have been skateboarding for decades I mean um and then there are a number of other ones in the um in Street skateboarding um and also taking really hard slams like you know so this this is a complete revision of the recent history of skateboarding thoughts on that and um on Reese and there are a few others was it is it um Lizzy who uh took a really bad fall that was filmed right there broke the um Knack offer femur yeah yeah these are tough ladies yeah yeah I'm doing it and for coming back Lizzy Lizzy did the loop she did the full 360 Loop first woman to ever do it so what do you think changed like that that paved the way is it just you know a critical mass of uh females doing it is it that um you know Sky Brown you know for sure for sure there were there were the Pioneers people like care about the Burnside um and uh uh there's so many others um Patty Hoffman was one of the one of the first verse skaters to who were they planted the seed and and then there were other women that took inspiration like oh girls can do this even though they're largely outnumbered and they get hassled for sure and then through the street era um people like Alyssa Steamer who who paid the way for legit Street skating um but then through the years it started to become more common more accepted which is dumb to say because it's just always been it should have always been accepted but the thing that that really tipped the scale was when everything was leading up to the Olympics there had to be equal divisions in equal disciplines for men and women and suddenly there was no question of should we have a should we have a women's event like no we have to have a management because that's how we that's the road to qualifying for this the Olympic stage and Vance Park series to their credit they were holding events simultaneously not that we're Olympic qualifiers but just their own and they said these events are equal across the board equal prize money equal attention I mean it was just like that that was just a matter of fact and that shifted a lot it really did now if you go to a skatepark you see plenty of them there yeah it's awesome like literal women like moms you know there's there are older women that are learning how to skate it's awesome not that it matters so much but does anyone claim to be the first female do 540 on vert is that sort of a known that would be Lindsay Adams fantastic um and she did that I'll tell you how she did that she was trying it um so she's trying she's trying to make twists uh she's married to Travis Pastrana it's like the you know it's like the the Elite action sports couple um and she was trying them she was she was getting pretty close and then we did a big exhibition in Paris at the uh Grand Palais on behalf of quicksilver it was a huge event um they put a half pipe up and we did this giant show there were thousands of people there and it was very much um unspoken but expected that I was going to do 900 at this event um I think it was I want to say it was 2010 Maybe and uh or no like 2009 and and the organizers were kind of like okay so we're gonna do this and then you know at some point you do a 900 and I was like I I can't guarantee that ever like every time I've ever made it it's been pretty spontaneous I've you know I've set out to do it and not I've come up short I can't guarantee it I'll try I'll try and they they're like yeah yeah okay and so I knew the whole time when they were skating I was like okay everyone's expecting this so I kind of went through the motions of of uh doing my exhibition tricks you know playing the hits and then started trying 900s and at the same time Lindsay started trying 540s because she was feeling that energy and so it was this sort of not battle but definitely we were we were trading hits it was like all right here goes Tony no he missed it and here goes Lindsay oh she missed it and then I uh she almost made one like was riding down you know and and then fell at the flat bottom it was like oh and then I made 900 and it was kind of the show stopper because like that's what they expected and everyone's going crazy and whatever people are coming down off the ramp knee sliding down and we're saying goodbye to the crowd and I look up and Lindsay puts her tail out there's still people standing on the ramp and she puts her tail out and I was like I think Lindsay wants to try it again here we go I'm on the mic now she made it love it she stole the show like without question it was huge you can look it up on on YouTube like it's there Lindsay Adams first first 540. it was awesome and then she made it and we all grabbed her and put her on her shoulders that is awesome it was pretty cool that was awesome because these things are like the four minute mile as a barrier then people break that barrier and then other people break that barrier it's I mean I I watched enough of skateboarding recent years see you know like the sky Brown thing she's phenomenal and I actually saw her family out to dinner here in Los Angeles and um with her brother and her folks are really gracious really nice and there again you know parents going to the skate park after all she's couldn't drive herself I think she's at that time she was probably like nine you know probably one of the biggest shifts too is that "

            "text": "parents encourage their kids to skate now could you imagine that when we were young never no there were so many factors telling us not to it's just made us want to do it more sure but yeah now now kids are like parents are pushing them into it get out there learn tricks it's like wait that's not what we're supposed to be doing but it's cool that that I think it I think with the the really cool factor of all that is there are definitely people our age I'm grouping you into my age category 47. all right yeah plus enough um but but that have kids and and skateboarding was such a special time in our life and then they're rediscovering it through their kids and they're skating together and I think that's just so amazing that someone of our age would be like you know what I used to do that you're into that like let's go and then you could show your kid how to do a sweeper I could probably do that I don't have kids yet but when I do I'll show I intend on being healthy enough and yeah to do a sweeper people can look up sweeper we don't have to explain it for him but a little laid back grind or a sweeper yep oh yeah because they won't they wouldn't think to do it no and they are doing all these difficult flip tricks and that's not my it's not my scene oh yeah what's your go-to on a game escape if you're gonna really like take out the younger generation um I can do Impossibles pretty uh pretty regularly on transition consistently I knew I'm flat so this is where basically you scrape the back of the it's an ollie really but it wraps around the back of it over your foot yeah um that's kind of my my sneak attack on game's Escape does Rodney Mullen get credit for that trick still oh yes that's yeah it's a Rodney are you still in touch with Rodney absolutely yeah yeah he's somebody that um certainly deserves deserves mention in the pioneering of tricks I think if he's the Godfather of modern skateboarding I think of Rodney you and Mark Gonzalez gons as like the the guys that I'm honored drove the um the progression in different partially overlapping directions that set the template for us I learned fingertips because of Rodney like the first trick you saw me do I learned that because I saw Rodney do it on the ground and I thought well I can't do it on the ground but I have plenty of time in the air to do it it's awesome it's awesome that Stacy put you guys together we we mentioned Bones Brigade but we didn't really talk about the architecture of it from the perspective of skateboard progression but it was um kind of like any good band it seemed like there was really good chemistry yeah um interpersonally but also um that there was each person had something unique you skated the way you did Mike skate the way he did Stevie the way he did and you know Rodney and you know and we respected each other but we also fed off each other Tommy Guerrero yep right because growing up in the Bay Area like yeah in fact Tommy's getting the hills of San Francisco in those videos makes it look easy yeah but those Hills are are rough they're dangerous and they have real life obstacles like moving buses you'll notice he wasn't stopping his top signs so that's fantastic uh we could reminisce about all these angles but the the point being that um spending time with people who do similar things or the same thing but do it differently is one of the best ways to progress that's why I routinely fly to Texas and hang out with Peter attia another podcaster Lex Friedman just because they do things differently than I do um where do you draw sort of peripheral inspiration from now like I know you I see Jimmy Wilkins at your ramp quite a lot the Phenom Jimmy Wilkins it's kind of eerie how good that kid is um who else are you spending time with besides Rhys and one of the reasons I asked this is that skateboarding is unique among many sports in that a given session a gathering uh to skateboard will include an enormous five-year-old man and 10 year old girls exactly yes which is which is incredible you don't think about soccer you know a serious game of soccer between professional soccer but also it's not even that we're skating together is that we are communicating and influencing each other I mean that is like the last conversation I have with Rhys was she's talking about like are you gonna try to do 540 stand I go yeah I'm kind of working on it she goes well I think because she saw me try one she goes I think you need to pull out a little more and she was right and she's how old again she's 10. and I and I didn't even consider that because I'm just back in my mode and I'm not taking into consideration that I don't have the snap that I had before I got hurt and she was I mean that was one key to me making it and you know did that that's but it but to me that's just that's representative skateboarding and the inclusivity of it and the diversity of it where it's me I'm 55 there's 30 year old uh Pros that are at the top of the game there are 17 year old up and comers men women 10 year old girl that is doing tricks that we've never even thought of or want to do and it's all part of the the whole mix that's really beautiful I want to ask you about "
