      "'Cause I'm not just sitting there thinking about all the GLP-1 circulating in my system. I'm working. A couple of things for optimizing workspace that are grounded in neuroscience and physiology. I've talked before about the fact that when our eyes are directed upward, literally when our eyelids are open, no surprise there, and when our eyes are directed upward, it creates a state of heightened alertness. And this has a relationship to the brainstem neurons that create alertness and their control over the muscles of the eye and, believe it or not, the eyelids. Now, it's not the case that if you are absolutely exhausted and you need to feel more alert that looking upward is going to make you feel wide awake, although it will help support your levels of alertness. The point here is that you can optimize your workstation in a physical way that leverages this aspect of the visual system and your level of alertness. Since most of us want to be awake while we're working, try and position your screen or your tablet, whatever device you happen to be working on, at least at eye level and ideally slightly higher. Now, if you think about it, most people are not doing this. Most people are looking down at their computer or tablet or are angling their eyes at their screen at about 30 degrees. That is not going to support heightened states of alertness and optimal attention. In fact, the opposite relationship between eye position and alertness is also true. When we look down, when our eyelids are slightly closed, it tends to decrease our levels of alertness and increase our levels of sleepiness. I really want to emphasize this, that there's a bi-directional or reciprocal relationship between the brainstem areas that control alertness and the eyes, meaning how alert you are controls how open or closed your eyes are, no surprise there, but also the how open and upward directed your eyes are will increase your levels of alertness And if your eyes are pointed downward and your eyelids are hooded, like they're slowly closing, like Costello's are always are, you'll feel more sleepy, especially if you're somebody who tends to have that mid-morning sleepiness or mid-morning crash. So what I do is I have a standing desk, but I also prop the computer up such that it's at least at eye level. And I haven't figured out yet how to develop a workstation where the computer is above me. I think the only way to really do that is actually to tilt one's body back, but actually that's not a good idea either. They have done studies recording from areas of the brain associated with alertness. Areas like locus coeruleus in the so-called reticular activating system. What they found is that depending on how reclined you are or upright you are, you will decrease with reclining and increase with sitting forward your levels of alertness. So body posture and whether or not your upright or reclining will impact your levels of alertness in the predictable ways. And where you position your eyes, whether or not your eyes are upright, so to speak, looking up or directly forward or looking down, will dictate whether or not you are feeling more alert or more sleepy, respectively. So try and arrange a workstation or a position of your body in your chair or your standing desk, whatever it is, that allows you to work with a heightened state of alertness. This is really, really key for me because I found that when I would sit down, not only would my hip flexors start to get sore, I feel tight in the back, et cetera, but if I was staring down at my screen all day or even for short periods of the day, I would start to feel sleepy and I couldn't figure out what was going on. I also thought maybe I needed glasses. I do wear readers at night, but it was really a problem. And simply by getting the screen directly in front of me at eye level, it's been completely transformative. So we're now at the description of my day in these protocols in which I would do a 90-minute about of work. Now, why 90 minutes? Well, the brain is going through these 90 minutes so-called \"ultradian cycles\" throughout the entire day and night. Every 90 minutes, we shift over from being very alert to being less alert, and then back to alert again. Here's how it works. At the start of one of these 90 minute ultradian cycles, my brain is not quite engaged in whatever it is I'm trying to do. Oftentimes I have things jumping into my mind, I've got distractions, et cetera.\n",

four months out of the year, sometimes five. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Could you, just for those that aren't educated about-- just give us a brief description of what smokejumping entails. DAVID GOGGINS: So basically, you jump into fires. Not into them, but you jump by fires that people can't get to. ANDREW HUBERMAN: So out of planes and helicopters. DAVID GOGGINS: Right, out of planes. I parachute. It's all parachuting. So you parachute out of airplanes. And then you fight the fire, you and sometimes four other guys or maybe eight other guys, guys and gals. And you're putting this fire out. So I lose millions of dollars every summer to do this. It blows people's minds. Why the hell are you doing this? ANDREW HUBERMAN: And you're breathing soot. DAVID GOGGINS: I'm breathing soot. Knees are jacked up. Hitting the ground. Hurting. Whatever. Talking to normal people, they'll never get it, so I don't even explain it to them. But this is why-- this is why I call it capped success. I'm talking financial success.

Or I know-- you know how a person-- and so many people do this shit. They're talking to you on who they want to be. They're lying to you. And they walk away-- I've done it so many times. You walk away like, god, man. If I could just tell them the truth. Why the hell can't I just tell him the truth? Know how good it feels for me now to look at you in your eye and every man I see because women won't get this. Women will not get this. Man to man, that man shit, when you look another man in the eye, and you know that everything you're fucking saying is real, and it comes from a real working place, something that you earned, it's the best feeling in the world. ANDREW HUBERMAN: You can say that actually happened. Like, I know with certainty what I'm saying actually happened. DAVID GOGGINS: Actually happened. Who I am and who I say I am, I am. No more lies. No more skirting the truth. No more bullshit. And that is worth every dime I've ever made in my life. And I swear to God on that. Every dime I've ever made in my life, building who I built, so I capped success because I know that if I ever go 12 months out of the year and don't put several-- every day, I'm going at it.

DAVID GOGGINS: No. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Those would be all your voice anyway. [LAUGHTER] You\\'re not listening to your top 10 favorite songs just to get rolling and then lace the shoes, hit the books. It\\'s all in here. DAVID GOGGINS: All in there. I used to do that when I was fat. Rocky, I mean, that was my thing. Round 14 was my thing. And as I got older and older and older, that started to go away. And I started to create-- I had all these people that I used to watch. Rocky was one, Barnes, Elias from \"Platoon,\" Jack from \"A Few Good Men\" when he\\'s on the stand going crazy. I saw a lot of these characters that I looked at and I was like, man, I ain\\'t got none of that. But they were characters. After a while, I lived a life so disciplined that every body that I once looked to, these fake characters, I built that as a man. And when I was younger, I had this image in my mind of what does a man look like to me? And I got all these people who are badasses, characters. And in my mind, I became that. And that\\'s what kept me going a lot was I had this pipe dream of becoming a little bit of this and a little bit of that because when you have no parents raising you and you have no role models growing up, it\\'s not daydreaming. You start to create a reality like, mm, maybe I can be that. And after becoming this guy, that is the biggest thing I can ever do in my life is I became that guy. That I once looked at all these, guys and now I look at myself like, god, who the fuck can do that? I can. But what it takes is a discipline that no one can ever even-- they don\\'t understand it. They don\\'t understand it. But everybody has the ability to do it, but they just don\\'t want to. They want to keep asking questions and keep going to seminars. And the greatness is right in you. And that\\'s why once again-- I say this a million times here, I do not feel sorry for you. I will not sugarcoat what I\\'m going to say to you because all of you know what I\\'m saying is the truth. Everybody knows it\\'s the truth. This is what it looks like. And you know it too. You know it too. If you ain\\'t got nothing, I hate to tell you what it looks like. It\\'s ugly. It\\'s not a documentary. It\\'s not an HBO special. You ain\\'t going to watch me like, hey, man, you guys gotta watch this. No, it\\'s like, oh, god, this looks like a train wreck. It\\'s like a nightmare. This looks like this guy\\'s got-- no, that\\'s what it looks like. Hard work looks horrible. It\\'s not motivating. It\\'s not motivating at all. It ain\\'t like Rocky round 14 where he gets knocked down and goes like this to Apollo Creed. Looks like a man being stuck in a fucking dungeon. And there\\'s no fucking way out. But you have the fucking key. But you refuse to use it. And that\\'s nothing motivating about that. So, yes, no documentary on David Goggins. ANDREW HUBERMAN: The real life-- DAVID GOGGINS: The real life. ANDREW HUBERMAN: --David Goggins is the documentary. It\\'s already being written. You\\'re it. DAVID GOGGINS: Right.

where, of course, praise feels good. Someone tells you, hey, I like that shirt, or good job today, or nicely done. Or for me, because growing up in a big pack of friends growing up, and I was never the greatest athlete, wasn't terrible, wasn't great, et cetera, like, a fist bump, or, like, feeling crewed up. And you're just like, yeah. But you've talked about this before in reference to the SEAL Teams. We both know a lot of people in that community. And the Teams component is a big part of it for a lot of people. And it's a wonderful thing. But there's a danger to that dopamine hit, for lack of a better way to put it, from we can only derive when it's coming from the outside. You're talking about being able to either say, good job, but also, just look to one's own personal history and say, I've done hard things. And I can do it again and again because I do it again and again and again. You're talking about parenting yourself, inspiring yourself, scaring yourself, all of that from the inside. So very different than the way we're raised, which is to figure out how to get the biscuit. DAVID GOGGINS: It's funny, man. People want to know how I'm always motivated. It's the unseen work, which you just said is a true statement. Those are false dopamine hits that people are giving you, man. There's no belief in that. These are teamwork dopamine-- like, I'm out running at 2 o'clock in the morning, 1 o'clock in the morning in the gym, long sessions by myself. That's real. I'm able to extract dopamine, the good dopamine whenever I want. Man, I've trained 99% of my life alone. No one patted me on the back. I did all of the work alone. And while I'm still hard on myself, I know what I did. So whenever times get bad for me, people are all this, who's going to carry the boats and lo-- that's real. I hate that people know me for that guy because that guy is not every fucking day. When they see me, they want that energy. That's not me every day. I can extract it immediately when I need to because when you train alone-- and I lived alone for so many years in this misery. And you're able to get out by yourself. I can take myself to such a level of real passion and purpose. And the feeling I get is something I can't even explain by mys-- I don't need anyone. That's why people come to me to motivate them. No one can motivate me. I have a resume full of fucking motivation that whenever I'm down, I'm like, oh hang on, motherfucker. Oh, you know the truth. You know the truth. You know the darkness of the fucking dungeons and the fucking demons that fly. And then from there, it's like, OK. You were there. You know this. There was no one there to pick up the rucksack, to pick up the boat, to pick up the log, to go in there. It was you. It was you. There was no pat on the fucking back at 300, at 275, at 250, at 220. No. That was you. So those things that come out of me, that extract from me in the darkness, people are looking for that pat on the back. Where is it? Oh, I don't need it because what I've done is in the fucking unseen work. I built Frankenstein. So whenever shit gets nasty, David Goggins goes, you had nobody anyway, motherfucker. So see how I'm talking to myself right now? That's me. That's shit fires me the fuck up. That shit makes me fucking nuts. You had nobody anyway, motherfucker. Look around you. There was no fucking team. It was you. There was no weight loss program or mom and dad waking you up, saying you can do it, you can be better, trying to build belief. You built belief when you had nothing. Rock bottom. You did that. So as times get hard for me, the truth comes out. And my truth is powerful as fuck. It's real.

It's a word just I feel like is like cast above us right now in bold face, highlighted, underlined letters. DAVID GOGGINS: Friction is growth. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Friction, like you're up in the morning. And I imagine David Goggins going to the coffee maker, stretching out, good morning, sunshine. And you're telling me from eyelids open there's friction. DAVID GOGGINS: Yes, and that is the thing that people don't-- they don't fucking get. The biggest misunderstanding about David Goggins of all time-- it's like whether you believe in God or not-- I do-- he put this lab rat, which is me, on this planet and said let me fucking see what a beat up, abused kid who can barely learn, barely learn, who has a twisted body, messed up genetics, sickle cell, this and that, let me give him everything that pretty much disqualifies you from the military. But back then, it wasn't as-- and let's put him in this and see what comes out of it. So to do that, friction-- you don't wake up in the morning time and go to the coffee maker. Matter of fact, sometimes you don't even sleep. What it requires is when I'm at-- 2 o'clock-- it's 2 o'clock in the morning. And my brain is thinking about a fucking drug. And I got to get up and look in my book to see what that drug is, how I remember it. And this is every day of my fucking life. That's why when I train a fighter or I train someone, I'm like, you have no fucking idea how great you really are because you are using such minimal, minimal of what you have. And if people can learn to focus, this is what's possible. While it may not be pretty-- like people want to do a documentary on me. I go no. I don't want to do a documentary on me because I will have normal everyday people picking me apart. Oh, his life is miserable. Who wants to live like that? It's crazy how he-- it's almost like he's sick. He's psychotic. The most frustrating thing in the world for me is when normal people judge a man like myself on what it really takes to extract greatness from nothing. It takes every bit of who you are if you choose that route. If you don't, Merry Christmas, do what you got to do. But, yeah, all these things for me-- like I told you, man, I'm going to keep it real. I'm not coming here to talk about perform without purpose because I go through-- when I write these books, I go through, I try to dumb down David Goggins. How can I give normal people-- and I'm normal. But I found something that most don't want to find. How can I speak to people and give them something from this crazy psychotic brain that I've developed? How can I give them that? So I sit down with Jennifer for years and write down perform without purpose, callus your mind, armor your mind, the cookie jar, the accountability mirror, shit that people can fucking use in their lives. No, no, I'm glad it helps you. But the barbaric life that I live that you have to live, the almost obsession that you must have to be great, you can't put that shit in a fucking book, bro. You can't put in a book. You can't. You can't write about it. ANDREW HUBERMAN: It has to be experienced. DAVID GOGGINS: It has to be experienced. And you can't even-- after you experience it, to write it in the book, it would seem like he needs to be locked up. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Too gory. DAVID GOGGINS: It's too gory. Doesn't make sense for a guy that everything, every second of the day he is trying to extract more from something. He's constantly thinking. He's constantly, constantly disciplined, never going off the path. Whatever is injured on him, he figures away. It's a conquerors mindset. And very few people, if any, can really understand what that is. Like I'm almost 50. And I've been this way for almost 30 years. Like what do you do for fun? These questions, I don't get them. I don't understand them.\", start_char_idx=0, end_char_idx=3834, text_template='[Excerpt from document]\\n{metadata_str}\\nExcerpt:\\n-----\\n{content}\\n-----\\n', metadata_template='{key}: {value}', metadata_seperator='\\n'), score=0.5286384392709721),\n",

AG1 is a vitamin mineral probiotic drink that's designed to meet all of your foundational nutrition needs. Now, of course, I try to get enough servings of vitamins and minerals through whole foods sources that include vegetables and fruits every day. But, oftentimes, I simply can't get enough servings. But with AG1, I'm sure to get enough vitamins, and minerals, and the probiotics that I need. And it also contains adaptogens to help buffer stress. Simply put, I always feel better when I take AG1. I have more focus and energy, and I sleep better. And it also happens to taste great. For all these reasons, whenever I'm asked if you could take just one supplement what would it be, I answer AG1.

Every day you wake up, you're going to probably be set back for the first four weeks before you lose significant weight because the mind is going to be fucking with you the whole time. There's no dopamine. There's no dopamine in there at 300 pounds. You got nothing. Your hormones are shot. You have to envision something that is more powerful than you. Something has to get you out of bed. And you have to create it. It has to be false because you're not it. You're a fat piece of shit. And that's the reality of it.

DAVID GOGGINS: We'll see. ANDREW HUBERMAN: So far, last 13 years, it's been no movement. But I have had other friends who were drug and alcohol addicts who quit after one conversation. Never went back. DAVID GOGGINS: That's awesome. That means they want it. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Yeah, just one guy, I won't out him, but walked up to me at a party in 2019, July 4th party, and said, I'm a pile. And I go, what? And he goes, I'm a pile. Look at me. I'm 60 pounds overweight. And I go, do you drink? He goes, every day. I go, how much? He goes, a case. He goes, I smoke a lot of weed. But he's successful in other areas of his life. And so I said, well, here's what I know. Quit alcohol and weed for you. I'm not telling people what to do. Don't eat until 2:00 PM. Get on an exercise bike, and pedal in the morning like someone's chasing you with a poison dart until you want to puke. And I was kind of half-joking. And then two months later, he was, like, I haven't had a drink. I lost 30 pounds. He lost those 60 pounds. He never went back. Now, he's super fit. It's amazing. So some people flip the switch.

InsideTracker is a personalized nutrition platform that analyzes data from your blood and DNA to help me better understand your body and help you reach your health goals. I've long been a believer in getting regular blood work done for the simple reason that many of the factors that impact your immediate and long-term health can only be analyzed from a quality blood test. Now, a major problem with a lot of blood tests out there, however, is that you get information back about metabolic factors, lipids, and hormones and so forth. But you don't know what to do with that information With InsideTracker, they make it very easy, because they have a personalized platform, that allows you to see the levels of all those things, metabolic factors, lipids, hormones, et cetera. But it gives you specific directives that you can follow that relate to nutrition, behavioral modification, supplements, et cetera that can help you bring those numbers into the ranges that are optimal for you. If you'd like to try InsideTracker, you can go to insidetracker.com/huberman to get 20% off any of InsideTracker's plans. Again, that's insidetracker.com/huberman.

that, that you make sure that the people close to you, your family, has everything they need and that they also understand that you're going to take what you need to continue to build you period. DAVID GOGGINS: Period. ANDREW HUBERMAN: In some ways, it seems you've also included the general public in that family. You're saying, listen, I'm going to give you what you need. I'm going to give you as much of myself as I can, except I'm going to stop right at the line that if I were to cross it is going to prevent me from continuing to build myself. And by the way, this relationship only exists because I don't cross that line. And I think as much as there are detractors out there or people that try-- I mean, whatever they're doing is pretty feeble, in my mind. I mean, it's like cap gun fire, it that. DAVID GOGGINS: Very feeble. ANDREW HUBERMAN: So many of us, men and women, old and young, hear something and feel something in your message. Like, yeah, it seems kind of crazy. Gosh. Doesn't he ever just relax? What about his sleep? Look at his feet. He's going to-- he's going to injure himself. Listen, I'll be very direct. I got friends who were in the Teams who just go, what's he going to do when he can't run? And I know the answer is keep running. DAVID GOGGINS: That's right. ANDREW HUBERMAN: But it's more comfortable for people, even high achievers-- DAVID GOGGINS: Especially high achievers. ANDREW HUBERMAN: --to believe that if you took one thing away, that it would all go away. It's absolutely clear that's not the case with you. I'm 100% convinced. I just know that because we're talking about this. DAVID GOGGINS: Do you know how many times I haven't been able to run? Two heart surgeries. Multiple knee surgeries. And after every knee surgery, they said, you're not going to run again. And I'm fine with that. There's no running up here, bro. None. This was what it was all about. That's what they lost. What if you can't run? Give a fuck. It was never about running. Why do you think I run? It's the worst thing. I hate doing it more than anything. Hence the willpower. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Right. Your anterior mid-cingulate cortex DAVID GOGGINS: Hence the willpower. ANDREW HUBERMAN: --would start to regress if you loved running. DAVID GOGGINS: Think about it. Every day, I wake up. I don't just run a mile, two miles. It's the one thing I hate the most to do. And I do it like I love it. 250, 260, 300-mile runs at one time. No sleep. And every step, when I get to the-- think about this. I get to the fucking start line cussing at Jennifer. Why the fuck am I here? I hate this shit. After 70-some hours of running, every fucking question I ever had is answered. Every question I had is answered. I capped success. People go, what do you mean, you capped success? For me to be who I am-- so when I go smokejump, I smoke jump three to four months out of the year, sometimes five. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Could you, just for those that aren't educated about-- just give us a brief description of what smokejumping entails. DAVID GOGGINS: So basically, you jump into fires. Not into them, but you jump by fires that people can't get to. ANDREW HUBERMAN: So out of planes and helicopters. DAVID GOGGINS: Right, out of planes. I parachute. It's all parachuting.

[MUSIC PLAYING] I\\'m Andrew Huberman, and I\\'m a professor of neurobiology and ophthalmology at Stanford School of Medicine. My guest today is David Goggins. David Goggins is a retired Navy SEAL who served in Iraq and Afghanistan. He\\'s also a highly accomplished ultramarathon runner. For those of you that don\\'t know, ultramarathons are distances longer than 26 miles and, in David\\'s case, often longer than 200 miles. For his achievements in athletics, he has been inducted into the International Sports Hall of Fame. He also held a Guinness World Record for the most pull-ups completed in 24 hours. I should mention that not only was David a decorated Navy SEAL, but he also graduated from Army Ranger School. David is also a highly successful writer, having authored two books, the first entitled \"Can\\'t Hurt Me\" and the second entitled \"Never Finished,\" both of which are best sellers. David\\'s books cover many topics, including his autobiographical description of what can only be described as an incredibly challenging child and young adulthood. His home was abusive. His school environment was abusive. He essentially had no positive resources directed his way and. In his 20s, he found himself to be obese, that is, more than 300 pounds working a job he despised for minimal pay. And it was at that point that David began an inner dialogue that forced him to explore the demons born out of his childhood but also the position that he found himself in as a young man and then began the journey to navigate that dialogue and transform himself into the Navy SEAL, the ultramarathon runner, the bestselling author, and the extraordinarily positive and influential man that he is today. As some of you may know, David has done various public lectures. He\\'s a familiar face online because there are so many clips of him on YouTube. And he has done podcasts before. However, I\\'m certain that you\\'ll find today\\'s discussion to be very different than previous podcasts that David has been featured on. The reason is that-- of course, we get into his accomplishments. We talk about the mindset that allowed him to achieve those things. But, today, David really lets us under the hood. He lets us into the form of inner dialogue that he has to embrace, indeed that he has to grapple with on a daily basis, sometimes multiple times throughout the day and night in order to impose the sort of self-discipline that he is so well known for. We also get into some of the scientific mechanisms underlying willpower. And we talk about David\\'s current endeavors that include, for instance, his own exploration of science and medicine for which he has become an intense scholar and practitioner. I should mention that multiple times throughout today\\'s discussion you will hear curse words. Now David and I both acknowledge that cursing isn\\'t for everybody and that cursing itself is different than cursing at somebody. Nonetheless, we do realize that many people, parents perhaps especially, might not want to hear cursing. If you don\\'t want to hear cursing, well, then this podcast episode is probably not for you. However, if you are comfortable with cursing or if you can tolerate it, I assure you today\\'s discussion is highly worthwhile.

ANDREW HUBERMAN: Yeah, so when you go to sleep at night, when that happens, you know what you're going to do the next day? It's pre-planned? DAVID GOGGINS: Yes. ANDREW HUBERMAN: OK. DAVID GOGGINS: Yes. It's always the same thing. ANDREW HUBERMAN: You're not building it on the fly. DAVID GOGGINS: No. Nothing's on the fly. So how it works internally for me is I'll put it exactly how it is. I'm an artist. And every day, I'm painting Mona Lisa. Every day. And but it's a different one. It's not the same painting. So every day I wake up, even though I'll do the same thing, it takes a different way to get there. So every day, in my mind, I'm going through my mind. I'm just like-- and a good painter will not just paint. He needs to create. And you can't create with phones and everything going around you. So you got to block yourself off. You only do two podcasts in a year. You block yourself off. And you're painting this thing inside. And you're going through all these different colors of paint and everything else. And you can only figure out the right painting if you spend the correct amount of time in your brain. So every single day, I'm literally going through my mind, and I'm painting. I'm creating this masterpiece. And the masterpiece is always myself. And but to do that, you cannot have any distractions because if you're talking to an artist and he's trying to think about the next painting, he can't. It's impossible to listen to you and listen to what your mind and body are telling you we must do. Because people don't do enough of. They don't do any of it. They don't have passion. They lack passion, drive, determination because you haven't spent time with yourself. Your mind will tell you what is next. But you haven't spent the time to go, all right, let me just figure this out. You're looking for let me Google this, and let me Google that, and let me-- you're not going to find it there because there's billions of people in this world. And they're all supposed to be individuals. But we have a pack mentality. That's why you're so fucking lost. Why am I so unique? I'm being exactly what the fuck I was supposed to be. I ain't follow shit. And when I did follow shit, I was like everybody else. The second I said, OK, man, hang on, dude, you don't like this, you don't like this, you don't like this, who are you, David Goggins? Who are you supposed to be? Miraculously, all these things just-- I couldn't even-- the list of shit I had to do, just, wham. It's like, fuck. OK. Wow. Once you sit down with yourself and say, OK, I don't want to be like Michael Jordan or Jim Brown-- they're both born on my birthday. So I looked at their birthday. I said, oh, maybe I can be one of the-- I can't. I'm going to be David fucking Goggins. And that looks like this. It just came. Everything flooded. So every single day of my life, there's a different thing that comes up that I have to do. But no one knows what to do because everybody else is following steps. Like the Republican and Democratic parties. I'm not political-- ANDREW HUBERMAN: Neither am I. DAVID GOGGINS: --at all for this reason. Republicans are going to vote Republican. Democrats are going to vote Democrat. You're not even a human fucking being, bro. No way all you fuckers agree with all the same fucking shit. And I know I don't. So once you figure out yourself and who you are, all the answers come. So every night, a different painting is being painted. And it's a beautiful painting for myself. I'm like, OK. That's it. It may look the same to most motherfuckers.

the words you've described. DAVID GOGGINS: No, do it. ANDREW HUBERMAN: You've said it before. You had a tendency at one point in your life early on tell lies, try and get people's approval. DAVID GOGGINS: Lied my ass off. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Crazy haircuts, attention seeking, and yet all of that triggered something that now is extraordinary. Do you think those hardships were necessary to flip the switch? DAVID GOGGINS: I don't know if they were necessary, but it was something that made me feel-- I didn't feel good. It was easy. The brain that I was given as a child, it was easy to go home and think about, how do I want to be a freak today? How do I want to show up to school today and be a freak? It didn't require me going home and opening a book up saying, it's going to take me all year to learn this fucking page. So instead of learning that page, I learned how to become a character. And maybe that character that I created, that 300 pound, insecure guy that used to fake it till I make it type of guy, let me become your friend, let me lie to you until you like me type of guy-- when you have any manhood, womanhood, a human being, a soul, a spirit, any-- I must have just this much pride because that's exactly what opened the door for me. Because every day, you were a character. Every day, you were a clown. Every day, you opened that Spanish book or that science book or English book, and you looked at it. It looked like a foreign language. And you're saying, where do I start? Where do I start? And, obviously, it was necessary. The more I talk about it, it was necessary because what happened is I became haunted by the mere fact that this is my existence. And you got to live with that. And I lived with it for a lot of years. And so I sat back and said, OK, all right, I know what this takes. And when you sit back, as fucked up as I was-- and I had a laundry list, a table like this of what I have to do to become just a human being that can make ends meet, that can make $1,000 a month. Just to get there was like, oh my god, dude, like how-- I'm 16, 17, I can't read. I can't write. Oh my god, I'm so behind the power curve. And my brain is about being depressed. And my dad beat-- my mom's not home. And kids are calling me nigger at school. And I'm like, oh my god, man, what the fuck do I do? And it wasn't like someone came around and said, hey, man, you can do this. This is all me. Some people want to know where does this cold man come from. I'm not trying to be cold. It's the reality of my life. It's the reality of a lot of people's lives. And so, yeah, that had to happen for me to be haunted, to be haunted, to pull out, to extract the guy that I am today. That haunting is something that's still there today because no matter how much you improve, no matter how much you change who you are, it's not permanent. You don't just wake up and say, oh my god, man, you're David Goggins. You break records. You do this. You do that. People want to know, how are you able to just be so hard? Because I never turn the fucking thing off. Because once it turns off, I go right back to the David Goggins that is. And that's the guy that I'm constantly fighting every day. And it's a choice. And that choice makes you misunderstood. It makes you crazy. That's why I hate fucking social media. In 2013, people wanted me to write my book. I did it in 2018. Took five years.

DAVID GOGGINS: Yep. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Because I was about to m it seems like a huge part of your process, maybe the entire process, is it's all stick no carrot, you talk about the carrot, the positive thing. And then there's the stick, the thing you're trying to avoid. I feel like it's-- the way it's landing for me is it's all stick and gas pedal. DAVID GOGGINS: That's it. ANDREW HUBERMAN: There's no carrot. You're not imagining, oh, when I'm a paramedic, when the book is published. And, obviously, you set those goals, and you make those targets. But it's all stick. DAVID GOGGINS: All stick. ANDREW HUBERMAN: No carrot. DAVID GOGGINS: Think about that. I'm waking up right now studying. Like I have a test tomorrow. I already passed the fucking test. Think about that. Every day in my life, that's what I must do just to retain what I learned. Four hours plus a day, I go through and do that. There's no stick. Or there's only a stick. There's never been a carrot, which is why when I speak to people, I have to figure out a way to resonate with them. Because all I want to say to them is let me teach you the real life, how it really is. The reason why you're a loser and the reason why you're not fucking making it and the reason why you're trying to go to all these-- I go to all these fucking conventions, speak all the fucking time. I look in the fucking audience. And these people sign up, sign up, sign up fucking every year go to a convention, thinking they're going to learn something fucking different. No, you're lazy. You know exactly what to do, exactly what to do. Because even me in my state of I can't read and write, I knew exactly what to do. It just sucks doing it. It sucks to do it. It sucks to wake up every morning of your life and say, god, man, I'm not smart. So guess what I got to do. I got to study the same shit that I got one of the highest scores in the nation on and do it again, and do it again, and do it again. It's not just there. It's not just there permanently for me. So, yeah, it's all stick. It's all stick. The only carrot you have is like maybe, maybe. Because whenever I take these tests that are real hard, the back of my brain is like a good chance you're not going to make it, Goggins. This ain't you, bro. This ain't you. You weren't born like this. This ain't you. The real you, bro-- study all you want to. But the second that fucking computer comes on with 150 questions, this ain't you, man. And somehow, comes back. I passed. I passed again, passed again. But that real me back here every fucking time is saying that ain't you, bro. That ain't you. And I have to outwork that voice. When I'm taking that test and I get to a question I don't fucking know the answer, I'm like fuck, man. And then say, see I told you, man. That ain't you. You're 300 pounds, man. You sit at home. You figure out how to do your hair. That's what you do, how to come to school with the reverse baldness when you're 16. That's you. So there is no get out of jail free card. This is why I say stay hard. Because when you weren't given the gifts, the only thing you can do in life is stay hard. And I know people cannot stand me. They can't stand this talk. This is all you can do. There's no magic pill or a magic potion. All you can do is outwork the man that God created or woman in you. And what that looks like is unfun. That's why I said, do not do a documentary on me because people will not see the truth. They will see what they want to see is I don't want to live like that.

healthy part of being human too. And obviously, you've worked it out. So I appreciate you sharing that. I don't think I've ever heard you talk about it that way before. DAVID GOGGINS: People are scared of that conversation with their wife, husband, girlfriend, boyfriend. But why are you scared of it? Why are you scared to tell a motherfucker, your wife, your husband, who you are, who you are, exactly who you are? And that was the problem I had-- that's a problem that a lot of us have in life. No one knows who you really are. No one knew who I really was. I went to a school where there were a lot of Black kids. A lot of Black kids didn't want to be in special ops. I never talked about special ops to Black kids. Why? I was wondering what-- I'm not going to fit in. That's not what they do. A lot of Black kids don't do that kind of shit. So whatever I wanted to do, no one really knew the real me growing up because I never wanted anybody to know the real me. I was always afraid of what you might say or how you're going to feel or whatever. You got feelings. You have a life that you have to live. So it's important that whatever's on your mind, you let that person know. Therefore, you're giving them the option to be with you or not. This is who I am. If you don't like it, that's good, man. I got it. But this is David Goggins. So that honest conversation is very important, man, so everybody knows where they stand. That person may not be for you. And that's all good.

for parents as it relates to kids maybe well not maybe limits their screen time force them outside in the safe weather and safe conditions of course but uh what about adults as well I what what can we all do um should we be restricting our screen time to X number of hours per today I mean you're the Surgeon General if you had a magic wand which I realize you don't um and you could make a uh a highly informed recommendation about what the thresholds for too much uh time on social media are um what would it be two hours three hours yeah it's it's a good question and let me actually go through some of these things that parents can can do for kids and that we can all do for ourselves with kids in particular um what I would do specifically with social media is and this is this is frankly what I'm planning to do with my wife for our kids as they grow up number one I would seek to delay the use of social media past Middle School uh at at minimum and I know that that is hard to do at a time where all kids are on social media and you don't want your child to be the only one left out and to be lonely as a result so that means no account of their own means no account of their own okay and I would make see to the best of your ability see if there are other parents that you can partner with to do this because it's hard to do alone as a parent but it's also if there are other parents you're partnering with that means there other kids who are also delaying you so that means your child is not alone and I think if you start the conversation with other parents you'll realize a lot of them are worried about the same things you are they may have thought about delaying you but they also don't want their kid to be the only one so this becomes a numbers challenge but partnership can help us if your child's already on social media what I'd recommend is to create sacred spaces in their lives that are technology free and specifically I would think about the hour before bedtime and throughout the night as time that you want to protect because kids are losing not just sleep because they're going to sleep later because they're on their devices but they're also waking up in the middle of the night maybe to use a bathroom maybe to get some water and then they get back on their devices again so the quality of their sleep is being significantly impacted by access to those devices during the night so I would protect that time hour before bed throughout the night I would also create make sure meal times uh were Tech free zone so that people actually that you talk to one another you see one another and time with friends and family members when you're out you know at a birthday party Etc make that Tech free time let them focus on their time with other people those three Tech free zones can do a world of good uh to help your child and then the last thing I'd recommend here the many things I think parents could do is to start a dialogue with your child about their use of social media um we don't always know how social media is making our kids feel uh from the and we may realize when we talk to them that they actually have their own concerns they might say yeah it's not making me feel really good but it's just like hard not to be on it everyone's like texting on this or everyone is uh you know everyone's you know sharing information and posting pictures on it I feel like I need to be on it you can only help them start to manage that if you know that that's a challenge that they're having so opening a conversation so your child knows that you're not judging them but you're trying to understand their experience is important also so you can help them understand what is not acceptable for them to experience on social media if they're being harassed or bullied by strangers uh that is a problem you want your child to to tell you about that to report that um if they see something posted online that's really concerning to them let's say they see a friend post that they're thinking of taking their own life or harming themsel in another way you want them to know that that's important to flag and to get help you know that they shouldn't just you know scroll past that so that conversation is really important and finally as parents we can lead by example right and this is hard because the truth is we've been talking about social media and youth and that's what the subject of my search and General's advisory was on but I have concerns about adults too I said as somebody who's had challenges in my own use you know of social media finding sometimes it bleeds you know past my bedtime and I'm realized you know I think m&a checked something for 5 minutes an hour later I'm still there you know scrolling through something uh and sometimes I you know you know I find myself over the years I found myself comparing myself also to posts I see online and unhealthy ways sometimes I find myself\", start_char_idx=0, end_char_idx=4924,

how it's designed and ultimately about how it ends up being used and what we've seen with social media as well is that uh for many people it ended up leading to in-person connections being replaced with online connections um we came to somehow value and um almost seek out more and more followers and friends on social media feeling like somehow that made us more connected but the nature of dialogue also changed like as human beings we evolved over thousands of years to not just understand the words someone is saying but to hear the tone of their voice to see their facial expression like you and I are sitting across and and we're both processing like our body language right and I'm seeing you nod your head and I'm seeing your eyes focused like all of that matters to how we communicate um but also like you and I are less likely to say something hurtful right now to one another because we can see each other if I said something to hurtful to you like i' probably see the the pain or consternation on your face and that might give me pause right when you're communicating online with other people without any of that information or with any of the uh sort of barriers if you will that make you pause before you hurt someone it leads to a very different kind of communication uh one that can be quite hurtful at times and I also think that one thing people many people don't recognize is that to communicate with somebody else and reach out and build a relationship with someone it actually takes a certain amount of self-esteem to do that you have to believe the other person's going to want to hang out with you they're going to see something valuable in you and for many young people what has happened uh and I think frankly for many older people too is their experience on social media has shredded their self-esteem as they constantly comparing themselves to other people like when you and I were growing up uh you know in the ' 80s we we compared ourselves to other people too right people have from Millennia but what's fundamentally different now is that in a given day you can compare yourself to thousands of images that you see online that's actually literally what people young people tell me I do roundtables with college students and high school students all the time around the country and the three things they tell me most consistently about their experience of social media is it makes them feel worse about themselves worse about their friendships but they can't get off it because the platforms are designed to maximize the amount of time they spend on them so you put all of this together and I think what has happened is that we're talking more but we understand each other less we have a lot of information but we're lacking in the wisdom that comes from Human Relationships uh and I think that that's really hurt us you know we see it certainly in the data that tells us about mental and physical health outcomes but there's also the human suffering component Andrew like it's really heartbreaking for me to travel around the country to hear hear from people of all ages often in quiet whispers about their struggles with isolation about how they feel like they just don't matter at all about how they feel like they just don't have a place where they belong and it's these are people on the outside look perfectly fine right they're posting happy things online to Folks at work they're seeming like everything's going great this is why I always tell people like you loneliness is a great masquerader it can look like withdrawal and sadness it can look like anger and irritability it can look like aloofness as well and so it's only when we stop to ask someone how they're doing when we take pause for a moment to maybe reflect on what's happening in their life that we realize that wow the majority of people in our country are actually struggling with loneliness yeah I'm a firm believer that\", start_char_idx=4027, end_char_idx=7958,

know growing up in the 70s and 80s I was exposed to like Community soccer teams swim team there was a community pool these were all public uh things uh there were um churches synagogues and mosques are we not seeing as much participation in those those types of organizations anymore and what other types of organizations are are out there that um you know come to mind when you think about the isolation crisis yeah so there there are several factors that have led to us being as isolated as we are one of them as you mentioned is the decline in participation in community organizations and this isn't a recent phenomenon this has been happening over the last half century in America we've seen lower participation in faith organizations in recreational leagues in service organizations and other community groups that used to bring us together and I think you know we can talk about the reasons why that has been the case U but one of the key consequences of that is that people don't have places where they can come together and get to know one another especially across differences so we actually associate more and more with people who are like us but this has also been fueled by a few other factors uh that are going on at the same time one is that just from a cultural perspective as modernity has arrived not just in the US but in other other countries we've seen that people are more mobile right they move around more we don't always stay in the community that we grew up in uh we tend to even if we move somewhere else for a school we may go somewhere else for a job we may change jobs and move somewhere else we are leaving behind communities that we grew up with that we went to school with that we worked with and I'm not saying that's all a bad thing right we're having more opportunities and that's a really good thing but I think one thing that we have not accounted for is the cost of these changes right if we know what the costs are of certain actions we may still take those actions but we may find ways to mitigate the the costs we may in this case invest more in our relationships be more conscious about reaching out to other people going to visit at them uh but that has been a a quiet but but devastating Consequence the other piece with modernity is that we have more convenience in our life which means that we also don't need to see other people to get certain things done like buying groceries or mailing an item out or getting something from the store I can sit in the comfort of my home and have everything just come to me now on the one hand that's incredibly efficient right but I think efficiency is an interesting thing because it's only one factor we should be considering in our lives there too we have to ask the cost and one interesting thing about Co is many people in the first year of Co when we were all separated from one another you know when we finally came back together again I had so many people who said to me you know what I expected to miss my parents and my siblings and my friends not being able to see them what I didn't expect was missing the strangers that I saw at the coffee shop or the folks who I ran into the grocery store or seeing neighbors as I walked down the street like I actually missed that more than I thought I would so we have lost out on some of those interactions and those loose ties but the final thing to keep in mind also is about what is happening with how we are using social media technology which I think is fundamentally transformed how we interact with one another and how we see ourselves and each other and this is particularly true for young people uh who are growing up as digital natives but what has happened there I worry is that and and it's not that social media is all bad just to be clear you know technology look I'm I'm a believer that in technology broadly speaking you know I'm a user of technology I spent seven years building a tech company I'm a Believer in Tech but I think whether technology helps or hurts us is about how it's designed and ultimately about how it ends up being used and what we've seen with social media as well is that uh for many people it ended up leading to in-person connections being replaced with online connections um we came to somehow value and um almost seek out more and more followers and friends on social media feeling like somehow that made us more connected but the nature of dialogue also changed like as human beings we evolved over thousands of years to not just understand the words someone is saying but to hear the tone of their voice to see their facial expression like you and I are sitting across and and we're both processing like our body language right and I'm seeing you nod your head and I'm seeing your eyes focused like all of that matters to how we communicate um but also like you and I are less likely to say something hurtful right now to one another because we can see each other if I said something to hurtful to you like i' probably see the the pain or consternation on\", start_char_idx=0, end_char_idx=5041, text_template='[Excerpt from

nervous system evolved under conditions of close interpersonal and direct connection and um to suddenly throw a technology in front of ourselves that deprives our nervous system of its normal development is it's clearly going to lead bad places it's also um clear to me as based on what you just described that you know when we go on social media we see something but they don't really see us you know hence perhaps why people get um aggressive in the comment section um you know they they want to be heard yeah um we want to be seen I think all of us want to be seen and see other people yeah and uh social media doesn't allow for it so easily um I also so know that a lot of young people will congregate with their friends to play video games online but that's different you're you're essentially showing up as an avatar MH and when you when we were kids we also played different characters in our in our games um but oh so different now um do you think that there will be a youth Rebellion movement against um these kinds of Technologies I mean there's a long history of of young people rebelling against the the stuff that's been put in front of them and they're like nope no more we're going to Rebel in fact that was the way that youth overcame the um the nicotine e epidemic if you recall it was the advertising pitching them against or pitting them excuse me against um wealthy cackling older men in chair in rooms counting their money that was what actually was successful in getting kids to not smoke because kids have a rebellious streak as opposed to when they were told hey smoking is terrible for you your lungs are going to fill with cancer kids didn't stop smoking teens stop smoking it was you know Rebellion has been um baked into our nervous system uh in the Adolescent and teen years so do you see a rebellion against this um social isolation our kids going to start putting away their phones and hanging out together again and that's going to rescue us and that's a way of saying what can we do for them what can they do for themselves and what can we do as adults because there are a lot of um the silent suffering is the thing I also really worry about yeah so it's a good question and I think there is already uh a movement that's building among young people to create distance between them themselves and their devices and particularly social media and it it's it's cropping up in different ways I'm meeting more and more some of these are organized efforts but I'm also meeting more uh families uh where the parents and kids together have decided that they're going to delay using social media and you know till past middle school or in some cases even later or where they're deciding that they're going to draw boundaries around social media use or they're going to replace their smartphone with a dumb phone that allows them to do things like text and make phone calls and use maps and and all that stuff but doesn't necessarily have social media apps on it now this is still a small minority and and we're dealing with a bit of a network effect here right because if you're the only one who's not on social media uh in your middle school class then you might feel left out which is why it's so important for parents to and and kids actually do this together but I do think that to use your analogy with smoking that one thing that I I think many young people bristle against is this notion of being manipulated and used for the profit you know of a social media platform and the reality is that the again we've talked about how the fundamental business model is for most social media platforms is built on how much time you spend on those platforms that translates to ad revenue and that translates to the bottom line whereas what I care about as a parent as search in general is about how well that time is being spent is it actually contributing to the health and well-being of a young person or or is it not is it actually harming them and this is where I think when I go out and talk to young people about this number one I'm so impressed by a lot of young people because they they already have a lot of these insights they're the ones living it right they're not thinking that this is all you know perfect and and it's all a pure benefit here they're the ones telling me that it makes them feel worse about themselves and and their friendships but they also having a hard time getting off of it uh because again of how these platforms are designed so about a third of adolescence are saying that they're staying up till midnight or later on week nights using their devices and a lot of that is social media use and this takes away from sleep which we know and you know better than anyone is so critical to the mental health and well-being of all of us but of young people in particular who are at a critical phase uh you know of development um the other thing that is very concerning to me is nearly half of adolescents say that using social media has made them feel worse\", start_char_idx=0, end_char_idx=5010, text_template='[Excerpt from

don't mind and then they find reasons to keep doing it um and I think that that's how I want a lot of rewards to work I don't think that rewards should be carrots that we dangle to try to control people's behavior I think they should be symbols of how much we appreciate and value a particular behavior and if you frame them that way it's a lot easier for people to say yeah you know what I'm that that reward is something that I really want but I'm I'm not only doing the task for that reward yeah that that you basically answered the question I was going to ask which is and you know at risk of sounding new Agy um but we are sitting in California um I could imagine that when one is focused on the extrinsic rewards so a physical task or a cognitive task for an exic reward if I'm focusing on the exic reward I'm also air quotes again not present right I'm I'm thinking about the outcome I'm not thinking about process and I think there's perhaps you can flesh out some of what this is exactly but I think there's a fairly extensive um data to support the idea that when we are physically and mentally present to the task that we're going to perform better and presumably our our um intrinsic liking of that task or performing that task increases as well is that true yeah I think so I think so if we want to break down the mechanisms for why intrinsic motivation is useful for for performance um one you touched on earlier it's focus of attention um you're it's much easier to find flow when you're intrinsically motivated you get into that state of deep absorption where uh time melts away so you mentioned you know sort of either speeding up or slowing down your your sense of time you forget where you are sometimes you even lose track of your identity and you're just you're just merged into the task uh and so that that that concentration is helpful there's also a greater persistence effect that when you enjoy what you're doing you're less likely to give up in the face of obstacles uh you're more likely to think about it when you're not doing the task and come up with great ideas and so um you know I think there's there's a working harder there's a working longer there's a working smarter and there's also a thinking more clearly effect this is a uh brief but related tangent one of the things that I've found incredibly difficult in recent years is that um you know most of my life really since I was a small kid I was forging for things and then you know I used to give lectures on Monday in class if they let me until they eventually stopped me about the stuff I was reading about all weekend so got an early start in the the professorial um front but now if I'm reading something and I discover a what I think is a really really valuable piece of information or a tool or a protocol I'm like wow this is really cool these findings are oh so cool there's a problem which is that now I have an opportunity to cast that out to the world through social media we all do this could be wait I'm sorry you're on social media um from time to time I you're all over my feet uh you and and I both do our own social media by the way which I really appreciate I think one can always detect if if someone else is handling someone's Social Media so yes I'm on social media and and I love that I have the opportunity to both um send out ideas and information and also receive feedback I really love the comment section um and always encourage comments I learn from it uh frankly love is a strong word I learn from it you know and and you and I were weaned in the academic culture where frankly the the kind of hazing that that one receives in academic culture is very different than the kind of hazing that one receives on social media but um let's just say that if you come up through Academia you develop a pretty thick skin um I agree I I do have to say though that there there was a part of me that was really surprised when I started posting on social that I love I love constructive criticism I was unprepared for the number of people who will knee-jerk criticize a study without even looking at whether the methods are rigorous right I'm like come on if I posted this surely it's at least worth considering the possibility that there's strong evidence behind it right well that's where a uh a um a brief uh I wanton to call it a rhetoric but a response of you know um you know clearly should read the study further because I think you'll be satisfied with the answer or something I don't know um but I agree it it can be a little bit harsh in there sometimes but you know the social media uh channels are I think have you know they have it's a double-edged blade um they obviously have their issues but um can be a wonderful opportunity to share information and share it quickly the problem is that it takes me out of\", start_char_idx=3941, end_char_idx=8774, text_template='[Excerpt from

And the reason I bring this up is, again, not because I dislike social media. I rely on and use social media for teaching and learning extensively. Really. But in going back to the pillars that underlie whether or not we achieve and experience agency, gratitude, peace, contentment, and delight within the pillar of function of self. There's this thing, salience, and what we're paying attention to, internal and external. And social media does seem to me a unique circumstance, never before observed in human evolution, where you have a near infinite number of environments available to you. And we know that a picture is worth 1000 words and a movie is worth a billion pictures. When it comes to drawing our attention. I mean, you give a young child, even an infant, an iPad, I mean, that kid is in the tunnel. I don't necessarily think that's a bad thing. And computers and computer screens are going to be a part of their lives now and forever, presumably. But it is the case that there are a lot of people who perhaps have the propensity for a strong generative drive, but because they also have a propensity for a pleasure drive, they wake up, they pick up the phone, they look at the phone, something captivates their attention, then they're thinking about that. It might be something that brings them delight, but more often than not, it's something that brings them either mild irritation or mild entertainment, maybe even intense entertainment for a short while. But very quickly, minutes and hours go by in which we are not engaging in the world unless we are posting valuable content. And so social media is a bit of a drain on these drives. I mean, it taps into these drives in very strong ways. And all one has to do is observe the behavior of people in public spaces, now, in airports, on trains, even in their cars. And people are essentially watching TV all day long. And it does concern me, and I raise it because I feel like it can distract from our generative drive in a way that doesn't necessarily speak to any kind of, like, deep character flaw or any kind of subconscious narrative, but just that. That salience cupboard, clearly something within that salience cupboard is happening that's unprecedented and very, very powerful and potentially quite destructive. Paul Conti: Yeah. I think to understand this, I would cite this belief. I believe this to be true, that human beings have a long history of underappreciating the power of the discoveries that are then in their own hands. So we discover gunpowder. How long until we're shooting each other? We discover nuclear fission. Now, are we going to destroy the planet? So social media, in a sense, it's a discovery. It's a thing that comes from what we've figured out as humans that now is there in front of us, and big, powerful discoveries deserve to be treated with respect. Gunpowder is very powerful, and if people need to hunt in order to survive, gunpowder can help them hunt without getting hurt, and we'd be more successful. Nuclear fission has provided some good things to humanity, but it can also destroy humanity. So I think the same is true here, that what you're talking about is something of immense power, and you can see how, if it gets out of balance. So let's use the salient. So let's say the social media is too salient. That's going to make a problem. If it's too salient in the sense that the person is always looking at things that don't make them feel good enough. Well, that's not going to go well, and that's going to affect what's in those other ten cupboards. And what is built on top of it. So then it gets into the unconscious mind, like, oh, I thought I was good enough until now. I'm looking at all this social media, and I realize I'm not.

It was a powerful movie. I think many people avoided seeing that movie because it reflects back on us just how addicted we all are and how manipulated we all are. - [Anna] Yes. - But it doesn\\'t seem to have changed behavior much. I have to say that the movie changed my understanding and my perception, but not my behavior too much. If we look at addiction as a maladaptive thing, something that\\'s making our lives worse or us less functional at work and in relationships, I could imagine a version of social media where it\\'s making me more connected. I mean this is a podcast after all. - Yes, yes. - I post videos. This will show up on YouTube and elements of it on Instagram as well. So much like sugar or other things, I have to imagine that we need to regulate, not necessarily eliminate, this behavior. So I want to talk about what that looks like. And I want to talk about what you\\'ve referred to as this narcissistic preoccupation that social media is creating. That we are all far more keenly aware of how we look and how we sound and how we are being perceived, than we were 10 years ago. - [Anna] Right. - So first of all, social media, how addicting is it really? And what is healthy social media behavior? - So the first message I would want to get across about social media, is that it really is a drug and it\\'s engineered to be a drug. And it\\'s based on, you know, potency, quantity, variety, the bottomless polls, the likes, the way that it\\'s enumerated, all of that. Which doesn\\'t mean that we can\\'t use it, but we need to be very thoughtful about the way we use it, just like we need to be thoughtful about the way we use any drug. And so that means with intention and in advance, planning our use, right. And trying to use it as a really awesome tool to potentially connect with other people, and not to be used by it or get lost in it. And of course, you know, people are going to come with different propensities for addiction to any drug, and that\\'s true for social media too. Some people will have no problem using it in moderation or using it in a way that\\'s adaptive. And other people will immediately get sucked in. And the key thing about getting addicted is when it\\'s happening, nobody who\\'s getting addicted thinks they\\'re getting addicted, right. Let\\'s face it, it\\'s only after the fact that we go woops, you know, what was that about? - Remember texting and driving, there are all these books about texting and driving, how terrible it was. - Yeah. - Even the governments have largely given up. You see these billboards - Terrifying. - like don\\'t text and drive, or any text can wait, or whatever. Not worth dying for. - Right, right. - But everybody\\'s texting and driving. - Right and if you look at young people today, teenagers, I mean they\\'re basically cybernetically enhanced, that the phone is there. You know, it\\'s like they\\'re talking to you and texting 12 friends at the same time, and there\\'s no stopping it. I mean the genie is out of the bottle where, you know, we\\'re not going back. - [Andrew] Right. - So we do need to figure out, you know, how to make this tool something that\\'s, you know, going to be good for us and not ultimately harmful. And I don\\'t have all the answers by any stretch of the imagination, but I do think, you know, some of the wisdom that we have learned from using other drugs, also applies to social media. Which is to say that we have to, again, put barriers in place that allow us to remain in control of our use, which means not too much, you know, not too often, not too potent. - Do you think in, going back to this idea of the unit of the day being a good attractable unit, a manageable unit of time for most people, so you\\'re saying in advance, so allocating two hours in which you\\'re going to allow yourself to have free reign use of the phone and all its apps and all its things, or even more restricted than that, meaning okay, I\\'m only going to allow myself 30 minutes a day to post and comment, and then that\\'s a closeout completely. - Yeah, so I think it\\'s, it depends on the person and sort of a combination.', start_char_idx=0, end_char_idx=4136, text_template='[Excerpt from document]\\n{metadata_str}\\nExcerpt:\\n-----\\n{content}\\n-----\\n', metadata_template='{key}: {value}', metadata_seperator='\\n'), score=0.43949697033023555),\n",

I realize you're not on social media and more power to you. But there's actually a prominent discussion on social media. There's an entire culture of young people, in particular young men these days, who, at least from what I understand in the research literature about this, are socially isolated, spending all their time online, maybe not even on social media, but are spending a lot of time online. Video games, hiding in electronic landscapes, digital landscapes, and concern about mental health issues there, etc. , concern about porn, overuse and addiction there, etc. . But social media itself is an incredible phenomenon to consider in light of everything we're talking about. Even though I am on all social media platforms and I am quite active there, I can't say that I've ever been on social media and experienced the kind of delight and thrill and persistent energy increase that I experience with in-person interaction. And yet social media, I have to assume, is capitalizing on some of these same reward mechanisms in presumably the nucleus accumbens. So are there any data? I realize this is a hard experiment to do in mice, maybe impossible, but are there any data that you're aware of that shows that social media has a high addictive liability? Or do we even need an experiment? Robert Malenka: I'm not sure we need an experiment. I think it clearly does. I agree with the point you're making. Although your podcast audience probably doesn't know who I am. I am in my late sixties. I grew up-- Andrew Huberman: --Well, they know who you are now-- Robert Malenka: --I grew up before computers, before cell phones. So I still am a believer, perhaps in an old fashioned way, that physical interpersonal reactions are really important. Obviously there are advantages to being able to interact over social media for all sorts of reasons. There's a lot of positive and good from that. But back to your question. Can we get addicted? I can't speak to social media. I can speak, and Anna Lemki, I think, is much more able to eloquently describe the issues around this. I can just talk from my own experience that my cell phone is and check, you know, this isn't social media, but checking my email messages, checking my texting, my text messages for me has a compulsive, addictive quality, like a lever press. It's like a lever press for a mouse. And part of that is my own personality. Part of that is the immediate feedback. So you get from a social media post, from seeing your name mentioned, getting a message from one of your friends. Sure, I like getting messages from my friends. It means they're thinking about me. It means I'm part of their world. I have no doubt it's activating my reward circuitry, not nearly to the degree that a hit of cocaine or an opioid would do. I don't know what else to say about it. I think as a society, we have to be aware of these issues, and it's really complicated how we manage, especially once you're an adult, you make your own decisions, for better or worse. But it's a huge issue, obviously, for anybody who has children or is planning to have children and adults. Andrew Huberman: On social media, I see lots of accounts of people that are 18 and older who spend a lot of time on there. And I'm not necessarily saying that's a bad thing. A lot of people have entire careers that exist on social media. It just seems to me that Instagram, Facebook, LinkedIn, Twitter have capitalized on this hardwired circuitry. I mean, to make it really reductionist, the release of serotonin, dopamine, and oxytocin by virtue of someone saying something to us, maybe not even a positive thing, maybe it's a negative thing. As you said, they're thinking of us. There's something about being recognized by others. And maybe this is a good segue. We're heading towards empathy here. A discussion about empathy. Robert Malenka: I think that's very well put. It is capitalizing on these more primitive neurobiological mechanisms that evolved for purposes of reproduction and survival. I think that certainly has to be the case. And I think it's important. I mean, thank you for bringing that up for us as a society, to be at least aware of this. And it's like many things, it's not all good, it's not all bad.\", start_char_idx=0, end_char_idx=4276, text_template='[Excerpt from document]\\n{metadata_str}\\nExcerpt:\\n-----\\n{content}\\n-----\\n', metadata_template='{key}: {value}', metadata_seperator='\\n'), score=0.4381987001116274),\n",

It was just-- Twitter was part of the story when it got really bad. And I've had vacations that have gone sideways just because I got on Twitter and said something, and then I had produced a controversy that I had to respond to, and then I had to do a podcast about that. And it was just, this is a mess. And so at that point, I have friends who also had big Twitter platforms who would say why are you responding to anything on Twitter? Just tweet and ghost. Joe Rogan-- ANDREW HUBERMAN: Yeah, post and ghost. SAM HARRIS: sat me down and tried to give me a talking to, as did Bill Maher. And both of them engage Twitter in that way. I mean, I think they basically never look at their ad mentions. They never see whats coming back at them. They use it effectively, the way I use, or don't even, use Instagram or Facebook. I mean, I don't even see what's going out there in my name. And so I could essentially do that for myself on Twitter, presumably. And I did that for some periods of time, but then I would continually decide, OK, now it's all balanced again, maybe I can just communicate here because it was very tempting for me to communicate with people because I would see somebody clearly misunderstanding something I had said on my podcast, and I think, why not clarify this misunderstanding? And my efforts to do that almost invariably produced a-- sometimes it was a meandering process of discovery. But often, it was just a stark confrontation with what appeared to me to be just lunacy and malevolence on a scale that I'd never encounter elsewhere in my life. I'd never meet these people in life, and yet I was meeting these people by the tens of thousands on Twitter. And so the thing that began to worry me about it-- and again, I understand that people have the opposite experience. I mean, depending on what you're putting out and the kinds of topics you're touching, you could have just nothing but love coming back at you on Twitter. But because I am very-- essentially, in the center, politically, and because this is now on my podcast, this is not in the Waking Up app. I'm often criticizing the far left and criticizing the far right. I'm basically pissing off everyone some of the time. It's different, if you're only criticizing the left, no doubt you get hate from the left, but you have all the people on the right who just reflexively and tribally are expressing their solidarity for you, and who are dunking on your enemies for you and when your enemies come out of the woodwork. And if you're only criticizing the right, you get a lot of pain from the right, but you've got the people on the left who are tribally identified with the left, who are just going to reflexively defend you. If you're in the center criticizing the left as hard as anyone on the right ever criticizes the left, and you're also criticizing the right as hard as anyone on the left criticizes the right, you're getting hate from both sides all the time, and no one is reflexively and tribally defending you because you pissed them off last time. You might be getting hate from the left now, and the people on the right agree with you but they can't forget the thing you said about Trump on that podcast two podcasts ago, so they're not going to defend you. And so I basically created hell for myself on Twitter because it was just a theater of-- it was just pure cacophony most of the time. And what I was seeing was-- I mean, there's no way there's this many psychopaths in the world, but I was seeing psychopaths everywhere. I was seeing the most malicious dishonesty, and just goalpost moving, and hypocrisy. I mean, some of it's trolling, and some of it's real confusion, and some of it is psychopathy, but it's like, it was so dark that I worried that it was actually giving me a very negative and sticky view of humanity that was-- I mean, one, I think it is inaccurate, but two, it was something that I was returning to so much because, again, I was checking Twitter at least a dozen times a day, and I'm sure there were some days where I checked it 100 times a day. I mean, it was, again, it was my main source of information.\", start_char_idx=3428, end_char_idx=7717, text_template='[Excerpt from document]\\n{metadata_str}\\nExcerpt:\\n-----\\n{content}\\n-----\\n', metadata_template='{key}: {value}', metadata_seperator='\\n'), score=0.4349268464480188),\n",

But by virtue of your personal interests and also where Meta technology interfaces with mental health and physical health, you're starting to become synonymous with health, whether you realize it or not. Part of that is because there's posts, footage of you rolling jiu jitsu. You won a jiu jitsu competition recently. You're doing other forms of martial arts, water sports, including surfing, and on and on. So you're doing it yourself. But maybe we could just start off with technology and get this issue out of the way first, which is that I think many people assume that technology, especially technology that involves a screen, excuse me, of any kind is going to be detrimental to our health. But that doesn't necessarily have to be the case. So could you explain how you see technology meshing with, inhibiting, or maybe even promoting physical and mental health? MARK ZUCKERBERG: Sure. I mean, I think this is a really important topic. The research that we've done suggests that it's not all good or all bad. I think how you're using the technology has a big impact on whether it is basically a positive experience for you. And even within technology, even within social media, there's not one type of thing that people do. I think, at its best, you're forming meaningful connections with other people. And there's a lot of research that basically suggests that it's the relationships that we have and the friendships that bring the most happiness in our lives and, at some level, end up even correlating with living a longer and healthier life because that grounding that you have in community ends up being important for that. So I think that aspect of social media, which is the ability to connect with people, to understand what's going on in people's lives, have empathy for them, communicate what's going on with your life, express that, that's generally positive. There are ways that it can be negative, in terms of bad interactions, things like bullying, which we can talk about because there's a lot that we've done to basically make sure that people can be safe from that and give people tools and give kids the ability to have the right parental controls. Their parents can oversee that. But that's the interacting with people side. There's another side of all of this, which I think of as just passive consumption, which, at its best, is entertainment. And entertainment is an important human thing, too. But I don't think that that has quite the same association with the long-term well-being and health benefits as being able to help people connect with other people does. And I think, at its worst, some of the stuff we see online-- I think, these days, a lot of the news is just so relentlessly negative that it's just hard to come away from an experience where looking at the news for half an hour and feel better about the world. So I think that there's a mix on this. I think the more that social media is about connecting with people and the more that when you're consuming and using the media part of social media to learn about things that enrich you and can provide inspiration or education as opposed to things that just leave you with a more toxic feeling, that's the balance that we try to get right across our products. And I think we're pretty aligned with the community because, at the end of the day, I mean, people don't want to use a product and come away feeling bad. There's a lot that people talk about-- evaluate a lot of these products in terms of information and utility. But I think it's as important, when you're designing a product, to think about what kind of feeling you're creating with the people who use it, whether that's an aesthetic sense when you're designing hardware, or just what do you make people feel. And generally, people don't want to feel bad, right? That doesn't mean that we want to shelter people from bad things that are happening in the world. But I don't really think that-- it's not what people want for us to just be just showing all this super negative stuff all day long. So we work hard on all these different problems-- making sure that we're helping connect people as best as possible, helping make sure that we give people good tools to block people who might be bullying them, or harass them, or especially for younger folks, anyone under the age of 16 defaults into an experience where their experience is private. We have all these parental tools. So that way, parents can understand what their children are up to in a good balance.\", start_char_idx=0, end_char_idx=4585, text_template='[Excerpt from document]\\n{metadata_str}\\nExcerpt:\\n-----\\n{content}\\n-----\\n', metadata_template='{key}: {value}', metadata_seperator='\\n'), score=0.4224688365942937),\n",

But I mean, it's surprising to recognize how much of a presence it was in my life given the sense of what is now missing. I mean, there's no question there's an addictive component to it. And when you see-- I mean, like when I look at what Elon is doing on Twitter, forget about his ownership of it-- I've got a lot to say about the choices he's making for the platform, but just his personal use of it is just so obviously an expression of-- I mean, I don't know if addiction is the clinically appropriate term, but his dysfunctional attachment to using the platform. Again, forget about changing it and owning it, but just the degree to which it is pointlessly disrupting the life of one of the most productive people in any generation. That was also instructive to me because I know Elon, and from a friend's eye view of the situation, it's so obviously not good for him that he's spending this much time on Twitter. I just brought that back to me. It's like, well, if it's not-- if this is what it's doing to Elon, and he's got all these other things he could be doing with his attention, how much of my use of Twitter is actually a good idea and optimize to my well-being and the well-being of the people around me? So anyway, there was an addictive component to it I think, and so when that got stripped off, I do notice that there's-- I mean, there are times I pick up my phone and I realize this is like the old me picking it up my phone for a reason that no longer exists because there's not that much-- I have a Slack channel with my team, and I've got email, obviously, but it's like, that is not much of what I was doing with my phone really in the end. And so it's just my phone is much less of a presence in my life. And so it's almost wholly good, but yeah, I think there is some danger in-- or some possible danger in losing touch with certain aspects of culture, which, again, I'm not even sure-- I mean, there's this question of how much is Twitter real life, and how much is it just a mass delusion? I don't know. But insofar as it actually matters what happens on Twitter, or insofar as I was actually getting a news diet which I'm not going to be able to recapitulate for myself, or I'm just not in fact going to recapitulate for myself even if I could, if any of that matters, I haven't discovered that yet. I mean, it was taking up an immense amount of bandwidth and it's impressive. I think I said, it was like I amputated a phantom limb. It was not a real limb, but it was this continuous presence in my life that-- it's weird, it actually relates to the concept of self in surprising ways because I felt there was a part of myself that existed on Twitter. And I just performed a suicide of that self. This is ending right now, there's no residue, there's nothing to go back and check, it's gone. And I didn't go back and look at my-- what's interesting to consider is that I'd been on Twitter for 12 years. I don't keep a journal. I mean, Twitter, in my timeline would have been a kind of journal. I could have gone back to a specific hour and a specific day and looked at what I was paying attention to. I mean, that could have been an interesting record of just who I've been for a decade, and probably a pretty humbling record of who I've been for a decade in terms of the kinds of things that captivated my attention. I didn't even think to go nostalgically just look at any of that, or see if any of it was worth saving, or archiving, or thinking-- I just-- delete. And so my actual sense of who I am and my engagement with my audience, the world of people who could potentially know me. What does it mean to have a platform? Where do I exist, digitally? My sense of all of that got truncated in a way that is much less noisy. I mean, it's amazing how much can't get fucked up now in my life. It's like with Twitter, almost anything could happen. The next tweet was always an opportunity to massively complicate my life. There is no analogous space for me now.\", start_char_idx=0, end_char_idx=4071, text_template='[Excerpt from document]\\n{metadata_str}\\nExcerpt:\\n-----\\n{content}\\n-----\\n', metadata_template='{key}: {value}', metadata_seperator='\\n'), score=0.4194750646710013),\n",

You still have an Instagram account I noticed. SAM HARRIS: I mean, my team manages that. I've never-- ANDREW HUBERMAN: It's a lot friendlier over at Instagram. I've been there a lot longer-- SAM HARRIS: I've never even seen it. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Oh, it's pretty good actually, considering-- imagine what would happen if you did pay attention. They're doing a good job with it. But your decision to close your account on Twitter I think grabbed a lot of eyes and ears, and there's a lot of questions about why. It was a very large account. It correlated with a number of things that, for the outsider, people might be wondering about new leadership, people who had been booted off, brought back on, or at least invited back on, and so on. You are certainly not obligated to explain your behavior to me or anybody else for that matter. But I'm curious if you might share with us what the motivation was for taking the account down, and how you feel in the absence of-- I mean, your thumbs presumably are freed up to do other things. SAM HARRIS: Yeah, I was getting like an arthritic right thumb I think, and I think it-- ANDREW HUBERMAN: If you don't mind sharing, I think there's a lot of curiosity about you and your routines. You've been very generous in sharing your knowledge, but also what makes you tick, what motivates pretty big decisions like that? It was a major platform for you. SAM HARRIS: Right, yeah, so it was the only social media platform I've ever engaged. I mean, like you said, I have an Instagram, I have a Facebook account, but I've never used those as platforms. I was never on them, I've never followed people. All the posting has just come from-- it's just marketing from my team. But Twitter was me, I mean, for better or worse, and I began to feel more and more for worse. And it was interesting because it was very-- I've talked about it a lot of my podcast, about my love/hate relationship with Twitter over the years. Many good things came to me from Twitter, and I was following a lot of smart people. And it had become my newsfeed and my first point of contact with information each day. And I was really attached to it just for that reason, just as a consumer of content. And then it was also a place where I genuinely wanted to communicate with people and react to things. And I would see some article that I thought was great, and I would signal boost it to the people following me on Twitter. And that was rewarding, and I could literally help people on Twitter. I mean, there are people who have raised lots of money for on Twitter just by signal boosting their GoFundMe's. And so I was engaged in a way that seemed productive. But I was always worried that it was producing needless conflict for me and was giving me a signal in my life that I was being lured into responding to and taking seriously that was out of proportion to its representation of any opinion or set of opinions that I should be taking seriously. So I was noticing that-- and again, this evolved over years, I mean, this long predated recent changes to Twitter, but I was noticing that many of the worst things that had happened for me professionally were first born on Twitter. I mean, just like some conflict I got into with somebody, or something that I felt like I needed to podcast about in response to on Twitter. Just so much of it, either it's genesis was Twitter, or it's the further spin of it that became truly unpleasant and dysfunctional happened on Twitter. It was just-- Twitter was part of the story when it got really bad. And I've had vacations that have gone sideways just because I got on Twitter and said something, and then I had produced a controversy that I had to respond to, and then I had to do a podcast about that. And it was just, this is a mess. And so at that point, I have friends who also had big Twitter platforms who would say why are you responding to anything on Twitter? Just tweet and ghost. Joe Rogan-- ANDREW HUBERMAN: Yeah, post and ghost. SAM HARRIS: sat me down and tried to give me a talking to, as did Bill Maher.

How much time is too much? I mean, I think it's going to depend on what one is looking at, the age of the user, et cetera. MARK ZUCKERBERG: I agree. ANDREW HUBERMAN: I know that you have tools that cue the user to how long they've been on a given platform. Are there tools to self-regulate-- I'm thinking about the Greek myth of the sirens and people tying themselves to the mast and covering their eyes so that they're not drawn in by the sirens. Is there a function aside from deleting the app temporarily and then reinstalling it every time you want to use it again? Is there a true lockout, self-lockout function where one can lock themselves out of access to the app? MARK ZUCKERBERG: Well, I think we give people tools that let them manage this. And there's the tools that you get to use. And then there's the tools that the parents get to use to basically see how usage works. But yeah, I think that there's different-- I think, for now, we've mostly focused on helping people understand this, and then give people reminders and things like that. It's tough, though, to answer the question that you were talking about before. Is there an amount of time which is too much? Because it does really get to what you're doing. If you fast forward beyond just the apps that we have today to an experience that is like a social experience in the future of the augmented reality glasses or something that we're building, a lot of this is going to be you're interacting with people in the way that you would physically as if you were like hanging out with friends or working with people. But now, they can show up as holograms. And you can feel like you're present right there with them, no matter where they actually are. And the question is, is there too much time to spend interacting with people like that? Well, at the limit, if we can get that experience to be as rich and giving you as good of a sense of presence as you would have if you were physically there with someone, then I don't see why you would want to restrict the amount that people use that technology to any less than what would be the amount of time that you'd be comfortable interacting with people physically, which obviously is not going to be 24 hours a day. You have to do other stuff. You have work. You need to sleep. But I think it really gets to how you're using these things, whereas if what you're primarily using the services for is you're getting stuck in loops reading news or something that is really getting you into a negative mental state, then I don't know. I mean, I think that there's probably a relatively short period of time that maybe that's a good thing that you want to be doing. But again, even then it's not zero because just because news might make you unhappy doesn't mean that the answer is to be unaware of negative things that are happening in the world. I just think that different people have different tolerances for what they can take on that. And I think it's generally having some awareness is probably good, as long as it's not more than you're constitutionally able to take. So I don't know. I try not be too paternalistic about this as our approach. But we want to empower people by giving them the tools, both people and, if you're a teen, your parents to have tools to understand what you're experiencing and how you're using these things, and then go from there. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Yeah. I think it requires of all of us some degree of self-regulation. I like this idea of not being too paternalistic. I mean, it seems like the right way to go. I find myself occasionally having to make sure that I'm not just passively scrolling, that I'm learning. I like foraging for, organizing and dispersing information. That's been my life's career. So I've learned so much from social media. I find great papers, great ideas. I think comments are a great source of feedback. And I'm not just saying that because you're sitting here. I mean, Instagram in particular, but other Meta platforms have been tremendously helpful for me to get science and health information out.

out and talk to young people about this number one I'm so impressed by a lot of young people because they they already have a lot of these insights they're the ones living it right they're not thinking that this is all you know perfect and and it's all a pure benefit here they're the ones telling me that it makes them feel worse about themselves and and their friendships but they also having a hard time getting off of it uh because again of how these platforms are designed so about a third of adolescence are saying that they're staying up till midnight or later on week nights using their devices and a lot of that is social media use and this takes away from sleep which we know and you know better than anyone is so critical to the mental health and well-being of all of us but of young people in particular who are at a critical phase uh you know of development um the other thing that is very concerning to me is nearly half of adolescents say that using social media has made them feel worse about their body image as they're constantly comparing themselves to others online and we used to think that this is just girls who are experiencing this and yes it is uh a lot of young girls who are experiencing these body image issues but now it's increasingly uh boys as well so this is happening across the board but the other piece I think that concerns me thinking about mental health symptoms is that you look at how much time uh kids are using social media on average adolescent are using it for three and a half hours a day on average so just social media just social media and that means many you're using it for far more than that and what you're finding though is that for adolescence who use it 3 hours or more in a given day their risk of anxiety or depression symptoms double right so and if they average uses three and a half days that means that millions of kids all across our country the majority of our kids are are at risk here and so you know you put all this together and and it paints a very concerning picture whatever benefits there may be for some kids of using social media and there's some and we lay out some of this in our advisory on social media some kids find social media is a great way to express themselves to reach other people to find support especially if they're from a community that doesn't have a lot of folks who like them around uh it can be really reassuring to connect with others but we can't say that just you know that to get those benefits we have to subject our children to all of these other harms right like kids are experiencing exposure to harmful content to harassment and bullying online six out of 10 uh adolescent girls are saying they've been approached by strangers on social media and ways that made them feel very uncomfortable um our kids are also finding that Health promoting activities in their lives are being cannibalized by their use of social media that it's detracting from time for Sleep inperson interaction physical activity and the erosion of self-esteem really concerns me as well because you know you need that not just for social interaction but like look as a as a father I want my children to grow up being confident about who they are being confident enough to be authentic as they up in the world to not feel like they need to create some brand that's different from who they fundamentally are just to sell that to the world I want them to know who they are and to be comfortable being who they are and to encourage other people to do the same to support them in their efforts to be authentic that's what I want my kids to do that's not what's happening to a lot of kids on social media so I think we not only need more kids to understand this and to support them in their efforts to create space and sacred spaces away from social media but we need to support parents here too cuz Andrew my big concern with parents is look we've taken this technology which is rapidly evolving which we didn't grow up with as kids and we've told parents you manage it all on your own we put the entire burden on parents and kids to manage this um you know when we were growing up you remember the motor vehicle fatalities were really high uh in America and we didn't say okay you know what that's just the price of Modern Life we just have to accept it and keep moving on with our lives we said hold on we don't have to go back to horses and Buggies but we also don't need to accept this death rate we need to make this experience safer and so we put in place with the advocacy and support of incredible groups like Matt and others across the country that me Mothers Against Drunk Driving ultimately the government put in place safety standards that got us seat belts airbags crash testing to make sure the frame of cars were robust in the setting of an accident and that help helped us reduce motor vehicle accidents and deaths and that's what we need here too like we need to have the backs of parents and kids and that means from a policy perspective putting\", start_char_idx=4003, end_char_idx=9042, text_template='[Excerpt from

limit as to how many hours kids can be on screens period And when I was a kid we were allowed to watch TV for a certain number of I think it was a half an hour or an hour my mom was constantly kicking us out of the house like literally you got to leave the house you got to go down the street and play un fortunately I liked outdoor activities um nowadays we also have the issue that a lot of parents are on their phones at soccer games and at kids events and so the kids are modeling their parents yeah um parents are distracted as well so there's a lack of social connection people even an immediate family people are screened in um you know TV there's laptops there's multiple phones iPads people are you more engaged in the screen portals than often than their own portals you go to a concert and people are watching the concert through their screen so that they can send the same image that everyone around them is sending out to the world if you think about it's kind of crazy um but I guess they want to capture that unique experience but uh it's not unique at all that's the that's the myth that's the illusion there's nothing unique about the your post of something that you went to go see what would be truly unique is to just experience that in real time right it's so wild to think about like what we think of as our unique portal is actually not unique at all it's what we do with it learn on my my stance is glean and learn information online then go use it in real life come back from time to time you know maybe an hour a day maximum or so can I just underscore the two words you said real life because that I think is a really important key here which is that all of real life isn't happening on social media there's a whole world out there which I think is real life which is happening offline and what's happening online too often is distorted right it's giving us like like even just take um you know just take the images that that we see of people their uh you know their summer beach images their like great vacation images that's not representative of their entire life of how they're living their life but we see that we see people's anger we and their vital and we come to believe over time that that's how people feel that's what people are dealing with and experiencing their life and and we've just got to get you your mom I love what your mom did getting you guys outside um my parents did the same thing too like we I was very blessed to have two parents who didn't come you know they didn't have a lot of resources growing up they didn't come to this country with a lot of resources but the one of the greatest gifts they G gave us is that they loved us uncondition Al the other great gift that they gave us is they pushed us to just explore to meet people to learn about the world uh they wanted us outside playing you know experimenting just discovering the world you know riding our bike around the neighborhood and and that's what we did but right now two critical things that kids need for their mental health and development or two important forces I should say that are impacting their mental health and development one is social media but the second also is the lack of unstructured plate time uh that kids have like unstructured playtime is time when we as kids learn how to negotiate situations with other kids how to resolve conflict how to recognize what's going on in someone else's you know eyes before they say something we learn how to collaborate and play with other kids this a lot you learn on the playground as it turns out but I worry that right now that we've almost somehow made that kind of unstructured time seem inefficient you know we've set these standards uh for our kids that they need to be uh you know getting fancy jobs and into fancy colleges and making an x amount of money and the path to doing that is you know to be enrolled in X number of activities after school and to do all this stuff in school and their lives are so hyper structured um that I worry that the time to just play to be creative to reflect and think to just have unstructured time with other kids has evaporated and I think that that also is hurting the mental health and wellbeing of our children I love the idea that that unstructured play time could be framed in the accurate context of the nervous system developing the way it was supposed to develop I mean I would argue that um success is going to be easiest for children that engage in the real world more in fact there's great risk to posting everything that you do online

that's really concerning to them let's say they see a friend post that they're thinking of taking their own life or harming themsel in another way you want them to know that that's important to flag and to get help you know that they shouldn't just you know scroll past that so that conversation is really important and finally as parents we can lead by example right and this is hard because the truth is we've been talking about social media and youth and that's what the subject of my search and General's advisory was on but I have concerns about adults too I said as somebody who's had challenges in my own use you know of social media finding sometimes it bleeds you know past my bedtime and I'm realized you know I think m&a checked something for 5 minutes an hour later I'm still there you know scrolling through something uh and sometimes I you know you know I find myself over the years I found myself comparing myself also to posts I see online and unhealthy ways sometimes I find myself um sort of pulled into uh content uh that uh you know ends up being angry and vitriolic and leaves me feeling worse you know at the end so I've experienced this as well and I think as parents one of the hardest things to do is to follow this advice we're giving our kids to draw those boundaries as well and to put our devices away when we're around our kids uh one experience I had which sort of I still feel bad about but which really helped kind of knock some sense into me was after my my son was born uh my older child I was actually I was search in general at that time you know I had you know it was lot going on it was busy job Etc but I wanted to make sure that I protected bed times uh and meal times for us to be together as a family yet one day when I came home you know after dinner when we were doing the bathtime and bedtime routine getting my son ready uh for the night uh my wife was changing ing his diaper and instead of helping I was just standing at the side scrolling through my inbox and my wife who has infinite patience and is like one of the most well adjusted people that I know just paused and she turned to me and Alice said do you really need to be doing that right now and she said just very quietly but I felt this like such a sense of Shame when she did that because I was like what am I doing like this is my infant child you know and the rare few hours I have with them during the day and I'm just scrolling through my inbox in my phone like like this is terrible and look I know that all of us do this it maybe in different contexts but it was a wake up moment for me because I realized like one like as you know well as a neuroscientist we can't really multitask right we're rapidly task switching right and that was time in my when I head was in my inbox and my head wasn't with him you know and my heart wasn't with him right and I was just distracted and so as parents if we can honor those sacred times you know when we're with our children to keep our devices away meal times sleep time as well it's not easy to do but it really sets a good example for our kids um all Behavior change that we're talking about here the kind of behavior change I've worked with with patients over the years are physical activity and diet all of this is harder to do when we're doing it by ourself it's a lot easier to do do when we're we have a couple of friends or family members who we agree to do this with we hold each other accountable we encourage and support each other um it's how I've been able to make the most successful Behavior changes I've made in my life have come about because I have two good buddies uh Dave and sunny who are my my part of my brotherhood and the three of us as brothers talk about health we talk about our finances we talk about our family and our friendships and our failings and we help keep each other accountable and so I would just encourage parents like is this sounds daunting or overwhelming you don't have to do this alone think about one or two people other parents who you might want to do this with and I guarantee you there a lot of us are struggling with the same stuff and they would probably welcome an opportunity to do this in collaboration with another parent such spectacular advice that I hope everyone will follow not just for their kids but for themselves I think that whether or not social media is addictive in the in the true sense of the word is is kind of meaningless debate at this point it's at the very least a compulsive behavior for many of us and as you described it in example you gave it becomes reflexive yes we're just you know we're not necessarily seeking pleasure or looking to to engage in online battles it's just it's become reflexive sort of like finding

And the person doesn't have to enact the anger towards themselves. So affect feeling and then emotion. So emotion is when we relate the affect and the feeling to others in the world around us. So, for example, a person might spill something and then it arouses anger, and now they get to the feeling part, but they have a set of unhealthy defenses, and they don't think they're responsible for things they're responsible for. So they just keep that load of anger, right, that affect upwards until they get to emotion. And then they decide, that wasn't my fault, it was yours. And that's why maybe they kick the dog or they slap somebody or they say something mean like, this happens. So if it happens a lot, like this is part and parcel of what's going on in us. A lot about negative emotions. There can be dramatic examples, but there's smaller examples that are winding their way through our lives. And the better we take care of ourselves, the less aroused negative affect we have and the better we cope with it. When it gets to the level of the I and when it gets to the level of the you. And if we think about prosocial collaborative behaviors versus the inaction of anger on a large scale, if by the time it gets to you there's still a lot of anger there, it is very easy to then paint with a broad brush, right? Oh, the problems are that demographic, the problems are those people who aren't like me. That's where anger is at its most dangerous. So the idea of having the negative affect under control, having the understanding and the control mechanisms, keeps us from getting to that broader level, the level of you, and then working in ways that are not prosocial but are antisocial. And this, I think, also relates to what we can find online. We can find online everything we can find in the world. So then we have a choice. Are we going to work on understanding what choices are we going to make about how we're engaging in the world? And if we're choosing the good things, we're taking better care of ourselves and we're better sort of citizens of our relationships, of our family units, and ultimately of our societies. Andrew Huberman: I've observed anger directed my way. Certainly I'm far, far from perfect. I have thousands of flaws, and I've directed anger towards others in ways that I wish I hadn't. A common observance I've had about myself and others is that when angry, a lot of valuable time is wasted. Instead of placing my efforts within the generative drive, creating things that I really value, the anger becomes an immense distraction. And I've seen this a lot, not just on university campuses, but one place I have seen it is when I was a graduate student or postdoc, there would be some interaction either between them in the laboratory I was in, although rarely, but more often it was about some interaction between a student or postdoc and someone in the outside world. And so they'd come in and they'd be really upset about it. And there's a tendency to try and support one another, which I think is healthy. But then it was like this would just continue and continue, and the person would be sitting in their chair. It was really upsetting. And sometimes these were really upsetting occurrences that warranted taking some time and just really stopping. But often I felt like things just kept spiraling up and spiraling up, and it's like halfway through the day, and again, I'm not immune from this, but I observed it more than I felt it, certainly. It's like, wow, that's a lot of time wasted, days, or perhaps even weeks and months. And then there's the sleep loss that goes with anger. I think that's one of the things about social media and online communities that's new and unique, is that it used to be when kids went home from school or we go home from work, something might have happened there, but you didn't have access to more incoming. People weren't calling you on the phone, telling you things that you don't like or talking about others in ways that you don't like, whereas all you have to do now is pick up social media.\", start_char_idx=3346, end_char_idx=7591, text_template='[Excerpt from document]\\n{metadata_str}\\nExcerpt:\\n-----\\n{content}\\n-----\\n', metadata_template='{key}: {value}', metadata_seperator='\\n'), score=0.4047213978885367)]"
