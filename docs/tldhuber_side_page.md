### **What Our Application Is Good For:**
- Providing quick access to summarized content on specific topics discussed in the Huberman Lab Podcast.
- Serving as a starting point for deeper exploration of topics of interest.

### Limitations of Our Application

While our application strives to provide accurate and comprehensive summaries of content from the Andrew Huberman Podcast, users should be aware of its limitations:

- **Accuracy of Summaries:** The summaries are generated by a language model trained on a dataset of transcripts and may not capture the full depth or nuances of the original discussions.
- **Scope of Content:** Our search functionality is limited to the content available in the Andrew Huberman transcript/RSS dataset we ourselves have collected. New episodes or content outside this dataset may not be immediately searchable.
- **Source Verification:** While we aim to include sources cited in the podcast, the application may not always capture or accurately represent the original sources of information.



We encourage users to use our application as a complementary tool alongside direct engagement with the Huberman Lab Podcast and related scientific literature for a comprehensive understanding of the topics discussed.
